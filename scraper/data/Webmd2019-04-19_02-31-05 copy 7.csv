All the classic symptoms, the cottage cheese except it's not discharge, it's inside my vagina and a little bit comes out but not in my underwear (sorry this is soooo graphic ew) It was red and itchy and painful and I took a canestan (yeast infection) pill and used the external cream, and nothing helped. Today, after 3 days, now it's so itchy and SMELLS like FISH! It didn't smell the first few days it was odorless. Could I also have BV at the same time? I am planning to get the internal cream to insert inside..I really don't want to see a doctor ughh, is it possible to have both or do yeast infections ever have a fishy smell? has anyone else seen this before? vagina filled with cottage cheese like white stuff (it actually looks like wet shredded toilet paper) but it's not coming out as a discharge it's just inside when I stick a finger up there my finger comes out covered in it. It's only starting to smell now and very itchy just in the past few hours, I have not stuck a finger up there yet to see what is happening.",Women's Issues

On opening the lid of the urine sample container, my thumb slipped and accidentally touched the inside of the lid. It was a little graze either. My thumb made full contact with the inside of the lid. Before screwing the lid on the sample, I asked the nurse if I could get a new lid because of potential contamination. She said it would be fine. However, I don’t believe the nurse gave my concern much thought and was probably in a rush to see the next patient. My worry is that the bacteria on my thumb would compete for growth with the potential ghonorrea and chlamydia bacteria in my urine and possibly inhibit the growth of these cultures. So if I am positive, the test would actually come back with a false negative. Can anyone give me any advice on what to do next or if I should be concerned about a potential false negative (or false positive)?","Chlamydia , Men's Issues , Gonorrhea"

Herpes Is for life, no cure, etc etc. However I contracted the herpes virus at age 19, started having painful outbreaks over and over, taking the 5×'s a day med and getting gastritis as a side affect which was say more painful than herpes. I had a doctor give me s bag full of Valtrex samples hoping the once a day med wouldnt cause the horrible side effect gastritis. Somewhere during that time I had read more on Valtrex something about taking it as a daily regimen even when no outbreak is present will suppress the virus and in rare cases cure the virus. That was the only time I've ever heard that and the only time I took Valtrex, and the last time I ever had an outbreak and the last time an antibody lab test was able to detect the virus in my body. I took Valtrex for a year after my last outbreak cleared up, and results from many std, blood, antibody tests since would all say either I've been cured or never really had it. At the time I had the girl who I contracted the virus from, and who had spread it to others not just me, ask her doc for valtrex and take it as a suppressant to the virus like I did for at least a year. 20years later and neither of us has the virus detectable in our bodies, no outbreaks no transmissions. Is there no science to say this is possible? Why do I not even read it given to people as possible and something to try?

Symptoms showing?,"My last unprotected sexual partner was almost 10 months ago. After i had sex, I feared having an STD/STI because my penis just felt abnormally warm. I waited a few weeks and got tested for gono and chlamydia. Negative for both. After i was tested, my mind was at ease and that symptom went away. I was even tested again a few months later by a different doctor and chlamydia trachomitis+Gono came back clean again. Still had no symptoms but I wanted to make sure.  Fast forward to now, and I have since been in a monogamous relationship with my girlfriend which began about a month after that encounter. Me and her had unprotected sex about a month after my previous encounter. And we’ve had sex like rabbits for 9+ months now. Except recently, she experienced some terrible pain during sex. To the point where entry is not happening. She insists that it may be a result of friction and lubrication, which can always be better. We used a glycerin based lube and I foolishly placed a dab on her clitoris during cunnilingus and it burned when she peed.  We’ve went this long with zero symptoms or issues during sex. Now, I have been urinating frequently possibly due to anxiety about this. I’ll experience a light lower back discomfort which I would describe as internal. And I tend to have an “itch” around the head area maybe once or twice a day. Not persistent to the point of discomfort or emergency, but an annoyance every now and then.  She doesn’t have a frothy discharge. No foul odor. The only itching or pain vagina-wise is during sex and post-shaving around the pubic area. She’s complained of fatigue recently as well? I’ve called nurses and they insist that it isn’t a yeast infection because there’s no discharge. I went to the ER as well for dry skin on my shaft area and they said it does not look like yeast either.  I’m having anxiety about this because I truly have been monogamous and me and her have been on a roll in our relationship. Meeting each other’s families, becoming healthier everything. I’m fearing that something pre-monogamy may be an STD and cause her to think I cheated and ruin everything.  UTI? Yeast? Trich?  Coming back clean on STDs three straight times has me uneasy on what could’ve sparked this random discomfort for her and symptoms in me.  TLDR;  Symptoms in partner and I popped up a month ago. Last sexual partner was 10 months ago.","Women's Issues , Men's Issues"

Then after surgery my doctors told me to stay off those meds during radiation as well, which occurred in February and March. After finishing all my treatment, I went back to my rheumatologist, who asked how I was feeling. I said fine. No symptoms. So he said just stay off the RA meds until such time as you need them again.

But starting about five days ago, I am getting a general feeling of malaise, feeling tired and kind of swollen and puffy, and my hands, feet, knees and shoulders hurt.

Especially at the point of entry and even some minor stroking. In her vagina, there’s a bit of friction based lesions I would say.

They said it wasn’t what I thought it was which was a yeast infection. I’ve been tested for STDs and came back clean for chlamydia and gono. The only symptom I experience is an itch around the head of my penis maybe once a day or every two days. Not constant to the point of discomfort, and it usually happens after a long day. There’s no discharge or pain/burning during urination. My last sexual partner was almost a year ago. With something like trich I’ve read that sometimes symptoms don’t always show. But a year of no issues and then this popping up seem so rare. There are no bumps or redness developing in my genital area. Her and I could do a lot better in terms of lubrication and we have been unprotected for a good stretch now that we’ve decided to be monogamous going forward. I get her warmed up fairly well, but I don’t receive lubrication that much. Not sure what to make of this.","Chlamydia , Men's Issues"

Back on October 1st, I started having high fever and pain in my throat, particularly on my tonsils. It rapidly developed into mononucleosis with pus pockets and white linings present on both of my swollen tonsils. After lab-testing a sample of my tonsil's tissues, the diagnosis determined that it was Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2) who was the culprit. I'm going through a mandatory service along with 400+ of my ""campmates"". There we usually shared utensils and glasses when dining, and the hygiene leaves a bit to be desired. The doctor made an assumption that I may have contracted the virus from my fellow officers through these utensils, or it could have been the result of me giving oral sex. Curiously, other than the symptoms during the initial outbreak, which include: - Mononucleosis (enlarged tonsils with pus patches) - High Fever - Whole Body Soreness Curiously, I had no symptoms well-known amongst both HSV-1 and 2, including cold and genital sores, rashes and blisters. After doing research, the symptoms I was experiencing better matched the Epstein-Barr Virus (I think some people also call it HSV-4 or something?) The test result against 7 types of viruses belong to the Herpes family stated that my type was indeed 2. Could that be a misdiagnosis? I plan to have an STD panel test soon but would like to know your opinions on this. As well, since the infection site was my tonsils and not my genital nor lip, is it safe for me to give and receive oral sex? I would want to minimize the risk of me transmitting whatever it is to my girlfriend or sexual partners I may come across. Thanks for your input :)","Men's Issues , Genital Herpes"

Arthritis,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/arthritis/38445/help-multiple-possibly-permanent-complications-from-thumb-injury,Help! Multiple possibly permanent complications from thumb injury,"Hey guys, this could qualify as a short story but I need answers so please bear with me. So, this injury happened on the night of a local Carols event in late November. Most of the younger population of my town go out in groups and get drunk for the Carols, see where the night takes them and whatnot, and naturally I was with them. I definitely didn't get the worst, a mate fell on his own Jack's bottle he threw on the ground and split his hand open quite badly. Later that night, I was at a friends house with a couple other mates. We decided it would be a good idea to play punchies (One for one arm punches). On my second hit, something else caught my eye as I swung and I basically stabbed his shoulder with my thumb at full power. Also, when I connected, instead of my thumb bending back like it should've, it stayed straight and drove into his shoulder like a lance. About 20 minutes later it was thrice the size, and all the little creases in your skin around the joints seemed like they were bleeding under the skin. By the next day it had lessened in swelling quite a bit and I had slight range of motion with my thumb. The next day, I had gained some more range of motion, although not much, and the swelling had mostly gone down, although it was still noticeably larger than my left thumb. I saw my GP and she said that I might have soft tissue damage in the joint at the base of the distal phalanx, and to get it X-Ray'd. I did that later that day, and they did find a fracture at the top of the proximal phalanx. The GP called me when she got her copy of the X-Ray, and said that I should see a specialist that she'd referred me to. I couldn't see that specialist because I had no money, and I was supposed to go the next day to a Medical clinic a significant distance away from me. I don't have a car to get there, and even a consultation with any specialist is more than I can afford, so I'm just dealing with it. However, what's worrying me is the way my thumb acts now. In the enclosed picture, you can see three tags on key areas: 1: The actual fracture. My thumb is no longer producing the same kind of pain as the initial weeks of recovery, so I believe this is actually healing fine. 2: This joint is the most worrying to me. I can no longer place a good amount of pressure with that thumb, and examples are the best way for me to describe this: -If I squeeze something (i.e. a cup, or a pen because I have a habit of squeezing my pen really hard when I write) hard it hurts sharply enough for me to jerk my hand back and possibly drop whatever I'm holding. -If I unscrew a lid, or something that requires constant pressure, I don't notice anything until I attempt to bend my thumb back, at which point it painfully clicks back into place. 3: This one is pretty hard to explain, even to someone in person. You know how the base bone in your thumb sorts of stays where it is when you independently bend your thumb back? Well when I bend my thumb back, the base bone moves inwards opposite the rest of my thumb. It could resemble what happens when you use a crowbar to lever something. The bone below #3 is the object being lifted, and my thumb above #3 is the crowbar lifting it. Make any sort of sense? I can also feel but *not* hear a click in the base joint when my thumb is bent fully back. Sorry again that this is so damn long, but the details are necessary to fully understand what happened. I am particularly concerned about this being permanent because it somewhat affects my ability to play guitar, and this is the last thing I need when I'm about to start my new job and start properly working with my band. Not to mention I'm only 19 so I don't really want to be living the rest of my life with a dominant hand that doesn't work properly. Thanks in advance!

I didn’t feel any pain when lifting but maybe delayed pain? This last week I’ve felt abdominal pain but could be cause of the ibuprofen I’ve been on. In 2011, my colonoscopy revealed mild Proctitis.

The pain that I had has gone away but I have hit a definite plateau in swelling reduction. Generally, in the morning everything is fine but when I begin to move about, the swelling returns. The swelling is severe enough that it is limiting my range of motion to about 110 degrees flex and I am still unable to full extend. Probably +5 degrees is the best extension that I can get. I saw my surgeon on December 1. He asked me to let it settle until March and then take another look. X-Rays show the implant is solid. I am getting another opinion on January 22nd.

His life quality has gradually diminished with him not being able to walk unassisted anymore and being in a generally bad mental shape. We are thinking of having a baby soon but my father-in-law is worried that he will not be able to see his grandchildren anymore. My husband is an only child and the situation is breaking my heart. We live in Milan, Italy and he didn't get as much sun as he used to and didn't enjoy life as much in the last few years. He had a surgery on the aorta 5-6 years ago and was a heavy smoker (1 pack a day) until 10 years ago. No other health conditions, balanced diet as my mother-in-law is taking care of his diet. He has even recently had a laser eye surgery and feeling perfectly ever since. So, he's pretty resilient.  He saw an Orthopedic doctor roughly 2 years ago and they told him that surgery would be very dangerous with total anesthesia because of the lungs. Then we saw another doctor that said the same thing. We lost faith and decided that it is perhaps safer to continue to live with the pain, which was then occasional. Except that the pain has got worse in the last couple of months and he is now unable to walk unassisted or sit down on a sofa.  Lately, I've been reading all these posts about elders in their 80s or even 90s who are having hip replacement surgeries in late age and everything is going well after for at least half a dozen more years.  I would be immensely grateful to anyone who can help with specialist advice that we would be willing to follow. We may even consider having a foreign doctor with a track record of surgeries for seniors with similar cases.  Please help.

Arthritis,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/arthritis/33166/20-year-old-months-of-joint-pain,20 year old months of joint pain,"Hello,  This is the first time using this forum so i am still trying to figure it out. I am a 20 year old student who was an active weight lifter. I have not been able to lift for approximatly 6 months now due to knee and elbow pain on both my knees and both my elbows. My knee issues started roughly 1.5 years before i stopped lifting. They would hurt 1-3 days after leg days depending on how hard I worked out but would always go away. My elbows started hurting only about 2 months before i stopped lifting. My right one started bugging me and soon my left began as well a couple days later. I continued lifting for 2 months until i decided it was not leaving so I stopping in hopes of it leaving in 1-2 months. Its now been 6 months and not only have my elbows not healed but my knees are still hurting as well even though the pain would go away after workouts in the past. I have seen many different doctors. My sports medicine doctor even ordered mri’s on all 4 joints and found that there is very slight tendonitus and muscle strains on my elbows but found nothing on my knees. Both my elbows and knees get slightly irritated when rubbing against clothing. My elbows mostly hurt on the back side where the tricep connects to the elbow. It usually begins to get more irritated once i type a lot, write a lot, or pick things up. It goes away right after I stop doing that activity but lingers. My knees hurt all over and usually hurt if i stand too long or try to do light excersizes like body weight squat holds. I have been going to the physical therapist for my knee pain and have been doing the excersizes they give me but seem to be of little help and sometimes even makes them ach afterwards. Stretching and cycling on a stationary bike seem to help along with hot showers. I have gone to a chiropractor and occupational theropist for my elbows. I am currently going to a DO doctor who does massage therapy on my elbows. Nothing seems to be helping with healing. I have seen no change after the second month of rest. No doctor has been able to tell me why it is that I have not healed. I am beginning to wonder if it is some some of arthritis. I am wondering if i should go see a rheumatologist at this point. I am confused on why both my knees and elbows are in this situation at once. I limit lots of movements now and can not do the things that I like. Any workout on my legs that need me to bend my knees even a little makes then hurt a couple hours after. My elbows as well. This is also just with light weight when I was testing out to see if im doing any better. I have been taking vitamins and minerals, glucosamine, tumeric and many others. I took naproxin for 1 month in the beginning 1000 mg a day and saw only slight change. I have not gotten any cortizone injections yet and am still going to physical therapy for my knees and to massage therapy for my elbows. Perhaps i should go to an acupuncturist to see if that will help. Any adive would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","Osteoarthritis , RA , Symptoms , Treatment"

I haven't had an outbreak in months, they r not frequent in my case. But I have read there is a small(?) chance the virus can be passed on, even during a ""non-outbreak"" period. I already feel really bad that I haven't discussed this with my partner, and wouldn't want them to think I knowingly put them in harms way, and didn't tell them. My question is, should I let the person know my situation and give them the option of whether or not they want to continue with me, with caution, and also risk losing them? Or should I continue to be silent, and just avoid sexual contact with them, should any outbreaks occur? Any and all feedback/facts/criticism is welcome.",Genital Herpes

I am still at the very early onset of my symptoms.  This all happened very suddenly. A couple of days ago I was sitting on the couch and I noticed that my left wrist would feel pain when moving it. I didn't think anything of it and went off to bed. Woke up in the morning  and again it would hurt when moving it. This time the pinky side of my hand was also in pain and would make a cracking noise when I moved my  pinky. The pain had gotten worse as the day went on and within the same day my right wrist had also started to hurt. The tips of my fingers and my upper and lower left arm have had intermediate mostly dull pains since then also. Coming and going at random. A spot above my right ankle is having a constant dull throbbing pain... Some of the pain is not in a joint but feels more like bone or muscle pain. Such as above the ankle and in my upper arm. It is still particularly bad when I move my left wrist. One minute i'll move it and the pain won't be there. The next minute, it will.  I just had a sudden sharp pain in my lower back as i've been typing this. And now a throbbing pain in my right foot.  Resting seems to help make the pains go away.

Her response ""no sorry it's im your hand it will hurt"". Now I have pain meds at this point and still feel this pain and can't bend my hand at all due to how hard this thing is. So i go to my room and I ask the new nurse ""please take out my IV it really hurts and is tingling at thia point and my pinky and ring finger are knumb"". She responds with ""sorry sweety we can not remove it until thw doc signs you out to leave"". Now not one person even looked at my hand to see if it was swollen or anything. I was finally released by 1pm so the IV was in from 7am to 1pm (not a long time). My hand swelled up and got me nervous but I was on better pain meds so I pretty much slept a week (gloriously)! Following week back at work my hand swelled within an hr of computer use. I waited a week called my Doc and told them whats up because now I could also see a brown line tracing where the iv was and my fingers were still knumb amd cold. They recommended hot water and stretch. So 2 weeks went by and even after 500mg advil and the exercises the hand still hurts amd is now mostly my whole hand and running down my wrist so off to the ortho. 7weeks pre-op I see an ortho finally, they say here take 500mg aleve and exercise stay away from heat, and they xrayed and said you prob have tendonitous in your finger now. I say the pain is in my hand and the focus on my wrist. Also by this time my pointer finger has become very painful and stiff to move and swollen to double its normal size. They say come back in 6 weeks which was yesturday! The Dr. Never looked at my hand I have been doing the exercises and taken both the aleve and advil (advil at night fot swelling aleve during the day to help mobility). He just said keep exercising you can not screw it up. Here is were I am at, 10weeks post-op swollen hand (knuckles have no definiton), pointer finger double its size and hard to move, still feeling the achey pain and brown mark under my skin. As I mentioned I have EDS and am thinking they are just brushing it off as pain from that BUT the kicker I have had absolutly no pain at all in my hands since I stopped playing aports at 18 I am now 35! This can not be coincidental and I am ag my witts end. I feel like this is not normal and wondering if anyone else has had issues similar?",

Diagnosed with RA a few months ago. My husband isn't the emotional type so he kinda just stared at me when I had a breakdown when I was diagnosed. He never really talks about it and I actually feel awkward talking about it to him, so I don't really have great support. He gets mad when I tell him that I don't like talking about emotional stuff, so here I am. I was diagnosed right before my wedding this year and I was doing great on enbrel and plaquinil and dicloflenac but then a month ago I started to get pain in my foot and ankle and trouble/pain when standing when I wake up. So it looks like I'm starting to get erosion per US and they want to change my meds to methotrexate but I'm planning on trying to start having a family in a few months. My husbands mad I won't take the meds and keeps making comments about ""well your going to end up in a wheelchair"" and ""you won't be able to pick up your kids"" and comments along those lines. I'm very freaked out by this an never expected to have this disease. I'm very healthy and athletic and I'm sad and sometimes depressed as I know how the disease can progress but I stay quiet and get upset when I'm by myself.

I cannot really find anything that is similar to what I have been going through online. A few days ago, I woke up in the morning with really bad knuckle pain. The pain is coming from the first knuckle (the one closest to the palm of my hand) on my right index finger, it feels similar to a boxers fracture. However, I have not had any blunt trauma to my hand and it is only that knuckle. It hurts to bend it, it hurts to straighten it, and I have very limited strength with it. For example, I went to grab a plate from the cabinet and I dropped the plate because I couldn't hold it. It hurts the worst when I try to make a fist. When I woke up, it was red, swollen, and a little warmer than the other ones. Also, the swelling seems to be more centralized to the inside or the palm of my hand, but still on the knuckle. It hurts to the touch on both my palm and the back of my hand. Any thoughts would be appreciated.","Living & Managing , Symptoms"

Now when she forms a hand position, her knuckle joints collapse instead of staying rounded, which I believe is due to her not having played all that time.  We're working on strengthening the finger muscles, using small stress balls, but her fingers are also at an angle from the base knuckles, which I know is a hallmark of RA, and they need to be at a straight, right angle.    My question: can the fingers be induced to grow straight if they're kept straight?

I had a HPV test 4 years ago that was negative. Not only was it negative, but because there were results that pointed to possible pre-cancerous cells, the doctor also sent it away to be tested too. These tests were negative for everything that was tested for, including HPV.  Since 1 year before that test, 2013 I believe, my ex-husband has been in the Middle East and, to this day, hasn't come back. This entire time period, 2013-Now, I have had no sexual contact or even kissed a man.  Two weeks ago, I had an HPV test, and it was positive. Thank god, it wasn't positive for the cancer causing strains, but all the same, I am extremely alarmed.  I explained this to my doctor (PA), and she told me that that means that I have had HPV to whole time. Could this be true? What else could have caused a positive test result?

Sexual Health & STDs,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/61585/ghsv1-help,GHSV1.... help.,"I got diagnosed with genital HSV1 back in late November 2017. It is now August 2018 and I haven’t had an outbreak since the initial one. I remember having a fever, feeling weak.. tired and having the blisters around my anus area and some in my vagina. My doctor informed me that it was GHSV1 and I most likely got it from oral sex with a partner that I had. I was so upset at first. The stigma around having herpes is not fun.. the jokes your friends tell, the lines in those movies or tv shows.. they all make me so upset. No one knows but my mother and I. I just try to brush it off knowing there’s nothing I can do about it but be careful and take medicine if I feel one coming on. I do get tingly and itchy down there but it stops and I never get any actual blisters or outbreaks. I’m assuming maybe it’s just the way I shave since my skin is very sensitive and products make me itch very easily. I wasn’t bothered as much and I try to go on with my day when I think about having it. The only time it truly gets to me is when I think of having sex, when I’m in the middle of a sexual encounter or when I think of a future long term relationship and I eventually have to tell the person that I’m with. I can’t even really enjoy oral sex anymore... I know transmission is lower than HSV2 but I’m still paranoid and instead of enjoying sex with someone, my mind runs and runs about my HSV1. Since I never had an outbreak since the initial one and it’s very rare that I will ever get one or get many in my lifetime.. I’m not bothered by actually having it. I’m more bothered by the “idea of having herpes.” The social stigma and the jokes around it are worse than actually having it. I’m afraid to tell a future partner whom I already invested time and love in and they walk away because they think I “slept around too much” or I’m “dirty”. I’m afraid to tell people now who I sleep with. I’m a young girl so when I date, of course I’m careful but if I drink one night with someone I’m attracted to.. or have a connection with, or I hang out with a partner I’ve had sex with in the past.. sometimes things happen. It can happen with anyone. I just need some advice to make me feel better. I just turned 23 and although I know GHSV1 isn’t a big deal as some people make of it... I try not to get bothered by sex is what scares me. I’m usually safe and I have medicine that I plan to take when I do get another outbreak/cream that I have for the blisters but my doctor told me daily medicine isn’t necessary. I’ve also been trying to eat healthy as I normally do and I plan on getting lysine pills to help keep outbreaks at bay. Any more advice on the transmission rates or just help/facts/advice in general so I’m more aware? It’s been a while but it’s been on my mind lately. I don’t know why... I sometimes just feel alone in my love life overall because I’m so scared of getting hurt again/trusting someone and this doesn’t really help that.

Arthritis,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/arthritis/28844/arthritis-in-my-future,Arthritis in my future,"Hi all, I'm a 17-year-old boy with a passion for fitness. About 2 months ago, I was working out in the gym, doing a seated shoulder press with 15 kg dumbells. The chair shifted slightly underneath me, causing me to lose my balance and my hand, with the weights in its grip and mid-air, to go behind my shoulder. It was painful. So basically MRIs revealed a posteroinferior labral tear, along with a chondral defect in the glenoid and an osteochondral lesion (yes I know what this means. I'm not rattling off the report LOL). I sat on it for a while, as per the doc's advice, doing the recommended physio. It didn't help. So I got an arthroscopic surgery done on my shoulder to fix it. During the surgery, it was found that the region between the tear and the defect on the glenoid was loose and not attached to the socket of my shoulder. That loose segment of the glenoid was cut out and the labrum was stretched over to cover that removed segment. Also, micro-fracturing was done. Now the doctor's visit during the post-op recovery leads me to my problem. During this visit, he tells me that weightlifting and all to a certain light extent is fine after around four months and for the rest of my life (when I say light, I'm speaking in my terms, e.g. a bicep curl of 50kg or a deadlift of 120kg etc) but bodyweight exercise should be severely restricted unless I want a high likelihood of early-onset arthritis. The same goes for me exceeding the weightlifting parameters I just mentioned. I'm not trying to sound impossible here or seem like I'm throwing a tantrum, being of the young age that I am, but weightlifting and other sorts of fitness, in general, are crucial to me. I can live a life without them, but not a content one. On the other hand, the huge threat of early-onset arthritis is not a pleasant thought. I was hoping someone here would have suggestions for me. P.S. 1) Please do not suggest running, that is my base level of fitness, I could do that on my deathbed. 2) I am not trying to go against my doctor's wishes or such. 3) This is not a request for encouragement or a cry for attention. I am very focused towards my recovery, and nothing will stop me from returning to the world of fitness with full force, but I need to approach that return with extreme caution.

Throughout my life my health has been fair, rarely got sick, except a few crazy things that are not explainable. It all started at age 20 in 2010 when I was rushed to the hospital with meningitis. After recovery no issues for a few years, then in 2012 I was back in the hospital due to a severe infection in one of the lymph nodes, located in the back of my neck (only seen in small children). After recovery just like before no issues for a few more years, then in 2015 I tripped and fell (not a big fall at all) but suffered severe bruising, and could barley walk, it turned out that I had a full tear of my gracilis tendon (not common, except in major athletes) and almost a full tear of my hamstring. The recovery went great, I was determined to get off crutches and recovered after 4 months. Then 3 months later I got sick, which turned into a really bad sinus infection, and bronchitis. From there it went downhill, first my left wrist suddenly became swollen. Went into my orthopedic surgeon and he did an injection which helped tremendously. I then started to have pain that following month in my abdomen, that couldn't be explained on imaging. So my OBGYN and a General Surgeon put me under. They ended up removing my appendix, and I also had a bad case of endometriosis causing them to remove my tubes as well. Pathology reported I had chronic inflammation of my appendix, but a month later they removed my gallbladder as well, which as well appeared to have chronic inflammation and a polyp. Since then I have suffered from inflammation all over, was finally referred to my Rheumatologist July of last year. They did an ultrasound of my hands and feet, which showed inflammation of the synovial fluid and that I had erosion. Also I have photophobia and really bad dry mouth so they did an ultrasound of my salivary glands and said I have secondary Sjrogens disease.  Tests done that were normal range RA factor, Ana, ESR, CRP Tests done that were abnormal CBC - MCHC always high, MPV always low CMP - Bun, Creatinine, AST were low every time C3 should be between 80-180/C4 should be between 10-40 My results were C3 - 38 and C4 - 11 They have tried plaquinel, methotrexate, and then pulling me off all meds. No improvement... After pulling me off all meds for a few months my doc started Humira in January. My symptoms have improved (minor) but I still have bad symptoms as far as pain, fatigue, sunlight sensitivity, acne rash, abdominal pain, and stiffness that lasts throughout the day. I have asked questions as to how they came up with the diagnosis of seronegative ra and what other diseases mimic the disease including how lupus has been ruled out, and yet have only got the run around. How do I trust, and know they are pumping the right medications into me when they wont answer the basic questions/concerns I have? Im lost, and afraid, and fear the doctors office anymore. Research shows reducing stress can have a huge affect on flare triggers, how can I do this? The hole medical system has me at wits ends 24/7..","Living & Managing , RA , Symptoms , Treatment"

Is this something I brought to the relationship and never knew it for last 6 months or is this something she passed on to me.  She has no symptoms on exterior of her area. Unsure at this exact moment of internal condition.  Is this something that I could of had or her without any shown symptoms and it is finally arising ?

About 3 or 4 weeks ago I started having pain in my left hip that is just like before the surgery. I did not fall, but slipped and ""wrenched"" my left hip. The pain is more towards the groin and in my left buttocks cheek, with pain and tingling radiating down my left leg (thigh, knee, shin and even my big toe). I see my orthopedic surgeon on September 1 and my chiropractor tomorrow. My chiro will leave my hips alone but adjust the rest of my spine as I really need that.

They are smaller than a .17 BB/pellet, there can be a little discomfort when masturbating but not much. I really can't even tell they are there throughout the day.  The bumps seem to be pretty dry one time i tried to squeeze one and I was able to get just a tiny tiny tiny bit of clear liquid out, but they don't ooze by themselves.  They seem to heel throughout the day by getting even drier and the outside getting harder with what I assume is dead skin, but then after masturbation they revert back (i guess the ""scab"" gets scraped off during masturbation).

Nothing came up in the results, and because I was extremely paranoid nothing came up in a second blood test I took just in case. They tested Chlamydia, gonorrhoea, HIV etc etc. They examined for HPV and herpes and saw nothing (in my country they don't bother with the herpes blood test for some reason), and felt there was no reason to think I had either. But this makes no sense- what else could discharge be? My doctor is away on holiday so I have to wait but I'm finding myself still worried and anxious and wondering if I should even have sex at all yet until this is sorted out",

Sporadic pain in leg","I am a 25 year old male, quite healthy, maybe a little unfit, but no smoking or drinking. A month ago I began to feel a light, hardly noticeable tension just above my calf behind the knee. Symptoms during the day are hardly noticeable and I can exercise without any discomfort, but at night my foot and leg feel inflamed and overall just uncomfortable to the point I started taking a few ibuprofen at night. There is a sporadic sharp pain around the center of my extensor digitorum longus and a less common, but similar pain around my sartorius muscle just above the knee. During the onset of these symptoms my foot had no issues, it was just in the leg. I went in for an ultrasound to rule out blood clots, as I do sit down for many hours a day to work at my computer. But now it seems my foot is causing all the problems. I rolled my ankle really bad 3 to 4 years ago. The attached image is the area of interest, I felt a pop and it swelled up like a bubble there. My foot healed within a month or so and I haven't had any notable injuries in the area since, and there was never discomfort up until recently. On my healthy foot, if I flex and touch that area I can feel the padding of tissue (muscle?), but on my injured foot it seems the tissue is missing and I can only feel bone, this leads me to think that the tissue is torn. It has always been that way since the injury, however the doctor at the ER said nothing about it and told me my foot will heal. Is it possible my foot finally decided to give in and I'm just now beginning to feel the long-term symptoms of that injury?",Symptoms

Four years ago my G/P started me on oxycodone 5 mg and ultram after a couple months he went to 10 mg than 15 up to 30 mg QR . The last 3 1/2 years I was taking 30 mg 5 times a day . In January 2017 I called for refill and I was told the practice couldn't write any scripts for controlled substance, later I found out the federal crack down on these drugs were the reason that he wasn't following proper guidelines and was suspended. So I went to a G/P I used before my insurance changed and couldn't go to him and he refused to prescribe the oxycodone at all he said I needed to go to pain management which I did , I told her the whole story and she would only offer 5 mg 4 time a day which was a waste since I was taking 30 mg 5 times a day and it helped about 75 % of the pain . I took the offer for now but right now I'm in extreme pain especially in my left shoulder , I'm due for a another knee replacement 7/11 but I won't be able to have shoulder surgery for some time after . I have xray's to show severity of joint damage and I have copy of all meds I received since 2012 that proves qty and medication I was taking . Why should I have such a problem getting the medication I need to be able to somewhat function , I only ran short once in 4 yrs and that was my last refill for 135 instead of the 150 I was getting , my fault as I would monitor the counts once a week . I understand about the abuse and this is what's causing the problem but I don't think it fair to me and people like me , is their anything I can do or anybody I can present this issue to. I'm going for knee replacement soon and I asked the Dr to please put me back up to 30 mg and she looked at me in a strange way , I have a low tolerance to pain and I know how painful this surgery going to be , thank you in advance for your helpful comments","Osteoarthritis , Hip Replacement , Knee Replacement"

I always shyed from the idea but I figured once married I would be fine and I would grow into it.  I did not have sex till I was married first time the marriage was only six months because of issues unrelated to sex although even at that time I saw it as a duty and though I didn't like it I did so without much thought. The second time my ex was aware of my lack of desire but we were still wed and married after a year. We were married for 8 after that. I left him but it was after he killed my pets. He was abusive but maybe I was to blame for the abuse. I was raped for three day after my divorce just over a year ago. I now am so very fearful and untrusting of men.

Arthritis,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/arthritis/8755/child-diagnosed-with-juvenile-rheumatoid-arthritis,Child Diagnosed with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis,"My 3 year old daughter was diagnosed with Juvenile Rheumatory Arthritis (JRA) 10 months ago. Nearly a year later, she has no symptoms. This is her story: In March of 2016 she woke up with a very swollen knee, warm to touch, and couldn't walk on it. Our pediatrician immediately indicated it might be arthritis, as more and more children are developing it. After a normal X-ray and blood work (rheumatoid factor: normal), our pediatrician sent us to a rheumatologist, who watched it for 2 months.  Emotionally, our daughter had aways been VERY attached to mom, but she went into a state where she would not leave my side (literally, I could not go to the store, doctor's appointments) for months without her being hysterical.  After no improvement, our daughter began 10 ml/ day of Naproxen for 5 months. Due to inflammation and fluid, her knee wouldn't go straight. We took her to physical therapy twice a week and did chiropractic work.  After allergy, blood, and stool testing our pediatrician determined that our daughter had many allergies: pollen, food (dairy and egg whites), and minor hypoglycemia. Our pediatrician attributes our daughter's JRA with Leaky Gut which more doctors are looking at the correlation to autoimmune and inflammatory issues. Our pediatrician (an MD) also uses integrative medicine like a nutritionist on staff and herbal remedies.  We were diligent about removing allergens (egg whites, dairy, pine nuts, sesame seeds) from our daughter's diet. We increased omega supplements, digestive enzymes, and probiotics. Our daughter improved through June, July, August and got slightly worse again in September, October. We reduced medicine to 5 ml/day. She improved and got more emotionally independent (less clingy to me) in Nov/Dec. Any kind of high impact activities (trampoline, gymnastics, etc.) would aggravate pain. In January our rheumatologist took our daughter off medicine but continued PT. Our Dr. predicted our daughter's knee would swell up and she would need to undergo steroid shot under sedation.  Unexpectedly, our daughter did better. An ultrasound with rheumatologist 6 weeks later determined only minor fluid still in the knee (which would not justify the cortisone shot).  Our daughter continued to improve with no medication, and she still has no pain, no swelling, and no warmth. It has been 5 months. Our rheumatologist does not believe in leaky gut nor does she believe in a significant correlation between diet and allergies. We do, based on what we have seen with our daughter's improvement. We have no know family history of JRA but my husband has ulcerative colitis (auto-immune) and many food allergies, asthma.  There is not a day that goes by where I don't watch my daughter's walk (looking for a slight limp) or feel her knee for warmth and swelling in the mornings (typical of JRA). Whatever worked, we are beyond grateful. I know each case is different but feel free to reply if anyone needs more info. I know how overwhelmed and scared I was when we got our daughter's diagnosis.",

If I try to masturbate with extreme speed it expands, but only to the normal size of my flaccid penis, not even close to my usual erections. I went to the ER and to a walk-in clinic, where both doctors basically told me to wait a few weeks and said that it might be due to stress. However, I have not been stressed at all lately, quite the contrary. An X-ray of the lower back / pelvis showed no signs of injury. I do not drink or smoke and exercise routinely.

I developed back pain, and abdominal pain on my lower left and right abdomen. I went back got a blood test, another urine test, and another pap smear.

I am fit but have hypertension that is controlled using 5 mg of bystolic daily. BP generally runs 120/77 but can be higher depending upon stress levels. My most recent physical showed healthy levels of cholesterol and blood sugars. I do however have anxiety issues. Until last Thursday, June 28, I generally woke once or twice each night with strong erections. On Wednesday, June 27, I had sex with my wife that morning and then masturbated later in the day. I woke up on Thursday with only weak morning erection. I wasn't too concerned but I noted it. (I have had a fear of ED since turning 50) Friday, I had weak morning erection and that night I had no real libido and when I tried to force the issue, I couldn't get an erection. I woke up Saturday morning with a moderate erection and was able to achieve 80 or 90 percent hardness and ejaculate. I was still concerned about not being doing so the night before. Sunday morning I awoke with a moderate morning erection and masturbated to 70 or 80 percent without ejaculation. Monday, there was no morning erection, but I was able to get to get myself fairly erect. Tuesday nothing. Wednesday, no morning erection but I could masturbate to about 70 percent. Thursday, no morning erection but I masturbated to about 70-80 and ejaculated. Each of these times the erection deflated fairly quickly once stimulation stopped. Last night, Thursday night, I was able to masturbate to about 80 percent without ejaculation. However, it deflated quickly again. No morning erection today. Throughout all of this, my libido has been subpar and my anxiety has been fairly high. As, I mentioned I have had a fear of ED. This came on so quickly, it has me very concerned. My question for you is, given what I am experiencing, do you think there is a physical cause of this or is it simply my anxiety about erectile dysfunction? Thank you",Men's Issues

Some of this was accomplished by finding the best ""hip surgeon"" in the greater Portland Maine area. That person was suggested by the anesthesia group I worked for at that time. Brian McGrory, MD informed me at my consult that he could be the best hip surgeon in the world but he could never make me 100% (I hadn't been since birth.) and that I also had to be the best patient in the world. Needless to say, after 20 years for the right hip and almost 18 for the left I am so thrilled to hear ""minimal wear"" for the liners and all else still perfect. For those who are afraid or uncertain, first find the best surgeon. Remember that pain should be your determining factor. When you can't stand the pain you will have the surgery so finding the best surgeon ahead of time is key. The types of surgery today are so different from 20 years ago. Much less recovery time and to be able to live life without pain is incredible. Please remember to be honest with your surgeon. I wish you all the very best outcomes.",Hip Replacement

I am in a relationship with a woman, and have been for five years. Before her, I slept with many women and engaged in what the medical field would typically call “risky sexual behavior”. I never knowingly subjected myself to someone who was carrying infection, however. My girlfriend, however, has only had two other partners 5+ years ago — one intercourse partner and one that she gave oral sex to. My girlfriend and I have been frequently sexually active over the past five years (with a sum of about a year of being separate due to work), almost all of which was UNprotected. We never worried about either of us carrying infection, and we haven’t been against the idea of getting pregnant. Neither of us, however, have ever been blood-tested for HSV 1 or 2. I’ve just tested positive, and she has an appointment to get it done.  My biggest question is: could this infection have stayed dormant in me for five years and, assuming that no cheating has gone on, avoided affecting my girlfriend? Furthermore, if we are BOTH infected, could it have really stayed out-of-sight for so long?  She has reported having to treat the occasional yeast infection/UTI, but has not had alarming symptoms ever in her life.

I noticed by touch a slightly raised small mark on my penile glands. When I looked at it the next day it was noticeable by sight and looked red to white colour. The next day when going to the toilet and pulled back my foreskin that there was a white kind of gunk behind my foreskin which I assumed was coming from the mark. This was pretty mini mull and caused no pain. The next day when peeing I noticed that it was very painful when peeing as I assume the urine was going onto the mark. It now looked like it may have split and was more a yellow colour. This was when I decided to see the doctor that morning. The doctor said it was probably Herpes as and told me to go to the GUM clinic for a test which I did. I had a culture test which was painful to take as well as a full std testing by urine sample. All these results including the culture came back negative. The pain when urinating went on for another day or two then stopped and the mark started to fade. 2 weeks later it is still visible to where the mark was but with no colour to it and it is not raised or causing any problems.  I decided to send off for a blood test online which was a IgG test for antibodies against herpes. This has again comeback negative.  I have never had this problem previously, I am recently married and been with my partner since 16 and are both now 33. We had one spell where we were not together about 8 years ago which was only a few months in which time I did have unprotected sex twice and she did not have any. Me and my wife have always had unprotected sex with each other and neither of us have had any symptoms of herpes before. With all this being said can I now rule out herpes with all these negative tests? And if it is not herpes then What would have caused the Problem I had as I am concerned it may be something more serious such as cancer. Do Cancer marks on the penile gland fade or they there always?

I don't have health insurance and am trying to delay a visit. I have been an active hiker for 3 years and am in my mid 30's. I normally have ""normal"" knee pain that comes with steep descents. It always goes away. On a recent backpacking trip I had 50 pounds on my back. Just a few hours into the hike (and no mountains yet) I felt a sharp and concentrated pain in my left knee. It was not extremely painful, maybe 5 out of 10. As I'm looking down it would be in the left portion of the knee (so on the outer part of my leg). This occurred on a very regular step; nothing out of the ordinary. I think the pain began as my left foot hit touched the ground but I am not 100% positive. I had never felt this type of pain before at any time in my life.  As the day went on this pain became more general and less concentrated. I definitely felt the pain more with taking steps up steep terrain.  My knee ached that night, especially if my leg was not 100% straight. The next day the ache came back shortly as I got into the hike. I soon found a good sturdy stick and this greatly aided me such that I felt little to no pain for the remainder of the trip.   Fast forward a week after the trip was over and I went on a day hike. Knee starts out fine but later in the day my left knee begins to ache (not concentrated). It seems to be related to my original injury.  That night my knee felt fine but as I was laying in bed it would ache if my leg was not straight (i.e. when I was on my side). I then take 2 weeks off and this past weekend I went on another day hike. Same thing. Left knee aches. As soon as I am done hiking it begins to feel fine again. But it aches if it is in certain positions (like at night when I have less control...).  It has been two days since that last hike and my left knee is feeling fine again but I assume it will ache again with my next hike. I am planning on investing in some trekking poles but in the mean time it would be nice to know what sort of injury this is. Thank you for any kind of help.",Knee Pain

So far, rheumatoid, Lyme, CRP, ANA, sed rate, TSH, & CBC have all been normal.  Beginning about 4 months ago, I began having intermittent aching pains over the first bone in my R foot and some pain in my R elbow when lifting heavy objects. Then, suddenly a month ago, all the joints on the right side of my body began hurting (incl foot, ankle, knee, wrist, elbow, & shoulder). Over the past few weeks, more and more joints have become involved, including the first knuckle of a few fingers...and it's slowly starting on my left side too, although the vast majority are still on the right side. I'm currently having up to 40 episodes of pain per day. I have NO swelling, warmth, burning, numbness, tingling, rash, etc. Basically no other symptoms. The weirdest part is that they're usually very fleeting and migrating pains, most lasting only a few seconds to a minute or two. Occasionally, something may hurt for hours though. The pains range anywhere from 2/10 to 7/10. Ibuprofen does nothing to help.  Anyone have any thoughts?",

I'm a 35 YO man who has had mild Psoriasis for about 15 years which I've been unsuccessfully treating with topical ointments.  My first question would be I recently had a Psoiriasis outbreak after a surgery (I guess it was too much stress on my body) which prompted me to go and see my dermatologist. Not sure if ""the juice is worth the squeeze"" just for a cosmetic repair and assistance with minor joint pain.  I am getting ready to see a rheumatologist to look into if I have Psoriatic or Rheumatoid arthritis. I have finger pain, lower back pain and some joint pain. However after reading quite a few posts it seems I'm no where near as bad off as far as pain. I am in the military and in great condition; always have been.  I have avoided these injections for years because the risks scare the crap out of me. I am not cool with an immune system that is weak. I have 2 young daughters and they come home with something new each week. I cannot afford to be sick all of the time.  Any guidance, input, comments or advice would be greatly appreciated. I am very excited about a potential clearing up of this Psoriasis; I have it everywhere now. Just seems that the side effects will change my life and its a change I may not want.

I just need to vent a bit. A year ago My groin hurt. Then I started to limp. The pain was different than RA flares. (Didbt burn like fire) but ached really bad and was really severe when I put weight on it. I eventually put 2&2 together by ruling out anything else. It was My RA but it had progressed into My hips. In October 2016 it became so severe I couldn't walk without such severe pain, I simply wouldn't walk. I've now been admitted twice for pain management and all they can do is put Me on a PCA pump. I spend 4-5 days in a hospital bed, then 4-5 more days in an in-patient care. With elder patients (nursing home facility) I'm only 44. It has affected My work. So I'm barely making the rent and am lucky to have a patient landlord. I run My own Hardwood flooring company. The ""company"" is Me, My tools and My truck. Sole proprietorship. I'm ""all in"" everything is wrapped up in My business. So....My work causes flare-ups. I go: work-flare-ER-Hospital-In-patient. Twice now. All the steroids they have pumped into Me over 15 years have had bad long term effects. Deterioration of muscle and ligaments. Just like the RA does. So, steroids are as bad if not worse than RA. I've done 10 different DMARDS over the years, some twice, with limited benefit with 2. I did get exposed to TB while on the DMARDS. So I have latent TB now, too. Taking an INH to destroy the TB. I've been ridiculed by the people who supposedly love Me (until they saw the flares) even after. ""It's not THAT bad this time!"" Or....""your just drug-seeking"" or ""***!! You EVER going to be a MAN again, how long will this ""supposed flare"" going to last!"" I hate the way My fiancé treats Me, but I'm terrified more of being alone with only the disease. I was straight up with her when we met 4 years ago. ""I have severe RA. I'm On disability but I'll work until it takes Me out and I have to rest.!!!!!! ""I've done tthat! I have to put up with cynical Dr.'s (at times) who see a 44 year old, visibly healthy man (when I'm not in a joint flare) questioning the content of My character. Yes Dr!!! I'm SEEKING DRUGS TO MANAGE PAIN!! What kind of screwy question is that? I have photographed the flare ups but have even gone in when every joint in My body is blown up. That seems the only way to get a physicians empathy. Despite taking HUGE risks barely being able to turn a steering wheel. I've almost wrecked god knows how many times driving to ""Prove"" the flare. Despite blood tests over and over I've had a Rheumatologist say ""it's all in your head"" until I ""proved"" her wrong. I hate rheumatologists!!! They peddle ""hope"" there is NO CURE! The disease is progressing and GODAMN the cold weather, I'm stiff as a board waking up on a cold winter day!!! I need help a d I have no-one to ask. I feel alone, isolated and I'm soooooooooooo. SICK OF BEING SICK!!!! I don't know anymore what to do. So....I'll keep going through this cycle. I need help before it all falls apart and I lose My home, before I'm on the street in a shelter waiting for some type of housing to ""come through"" I don't know where to turn for help. I have no emotional support because everyone has always looked to Me to be ""The Rock"" the foundation and main source of income. I feel really, really alone and isolated and like nobody really, in their heart, cares. I hate feeling this Hopeless and discouraged and this ""poor Me"" pity party stuff is EXACTLY what this all sounds like when I re-read it. No matter what I do or say, I feel like the ""house of cards"" will come crumbling down.

I had my first hip replacement when I was 41. If I did some hard work around the house or some sort of physical activity with the family, I would pay for it that night with heavy pain in the lower half of my body. To shorten up this story, I am now 61 and I have had 2 more hip surgeries( the new right one had problems, so after 2 years they had to do a revision which is causing heavy pain problems), both knees scoped, minor back surgery, shoulder surgery, 2 different pain management doctors, countless chiropractors, and one final hip + knee surgeon and 1 back surgeon to help me find what to do. Even though over the past 10 years I have had an unbelievable amount of Xrays and MRI's, The hip Doctor wanted a new set including a Bars MRI and other test that I have not heard about. I also point out that if you feel the bottom of my right buttocks you will feel a prominent lump and it starts from the top of my right buttocks all the way down to almost my knee and is very painful. It feels like a pipe or tube of some kind, but hey, what do I know,right. He did feel it and did acknowledge it, so at least I wasn't nuts. I had the test done and on the xrays, the technician put a marker from the top of the lump to the bottom so the doctor could focus on that area. The Doctor said that all the test came back negative. Even the long lump I talked about, the xray showed that area was completely black. It showed nothing. He said it was not my hip,however he said that both my knees should be replaced. But why buy a new garage door if the car doesn't work. I saw the back surgeon that he recommended, and after reading and looking at all the tests I had done, he told me that it wasn't my back and it had to be the hips. He recommended that I go back to the pain management doctor and see what he could do. That was in September and my situation has increasingly has gone south. Next week I am going to another pain management Doctor because I have run out of options. The hip Doctor has told me that if I go to another Doctor, he will me glad to send him everything he did on me. I am wary to go to another surgical place like the Rothman Institute in Philadelphia, because they are surgeons and not diagnoticians, and if they can't make money for all the time they are going to spend, there are a lot of patients in the waiting room where they can. I know that sounds very cynical, but as I said,"" I am at the end of my rope"", and the outlook is dim. Thanks for reading this.

The first one was around afternoon when I got to a look like a legit wellness spa, but when the spa session is about to come to an end, there was a lingam massage. Then after the lingam massage, she offered to have a release by HandJob and she did. After the massage, she had a hot towel and wiped it around my genitals for cleaning because of the HandJob.  Then in the evening, I got into another more social massage parlor. I had a blowjob with Condoms on, and she started to suck/lick my nipples, and my genital with the condom on my genitals. Then, she did a HandJob afterwards.  Just to clarify there are no Sexual Intercourse (coitus) that happened, meaning no vagina-penis intercourse. Just rubbing, licking, and handjob/blowjob.  I know its weird that I did these 2 places for a day, but I did it because of curiosity, and I am really not a pervert guy.  But, I am just worried if I could STD on some activities I mentioned??

Sexual Health & STDs,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/54316/am-i-having-herpes-outbreaks,Am I Having Herpes Outbreaks?,"Hi community, thank you for your time.  I have been having vaginal burning off and on for the last six months or so.  The history...I went to my obgyn about a year ago and requested to be “tested for everything.” She took a blood sample, and when I came in for results two weeks later she said “everything is totally fine, the only thing that came back positive is the herpes.” Threw paperwork in my hands and left the room. Needless to say I have found a new dr since. I was completely shocked because I did not suspect anything and was just going for my yearly screening in an attempt to be sexually responsible. Upon further review of my test results, I saw that My igm was positive for hsv2 (1:80) and my igg was negative for both hsv 1 and 2 (0.09) I spoke to a friend who is an obgyn in another state and she told me this was a useless test and in the absence of an outbreak, it meant nothing. I did not think I had ever had an outbreak, but once I thought about it, I remembered having what I thought was a yeast infection about 2 days after a one night stand with a questionable guy. I had the usual itching and burning and one bump-like area. It was basically swollen and red with a tiny Whitehead in the center, no bigger than a pin head. To me it looked like an inflamed hair follicle. I have had similar bumps with a yeast infection before and so I figured that’s what it was. It didn’t hurt at all. I treated for a yeast infection and the bump and symptoms went away in about 3 days. I spoke to my dr about this and she said it didn’t sound like an outbreak. We had sex one time and used a condom. This was the only new partner I had had since my last full panel the previous year, which was negative for everything. Also, I had been with this guy only about a month before the blood test, so I guess it’s not likely that it would have shown up yet. However, I worry that this is why only the igm was positive, and this raised my concern. I went ahead and told my boyfriend all of this, and he decided he loved me and didn’t care if I had it or not :-) He decided he wanted to continue to have unprotected sex. I continud with no symptoms we recognized as herpes, but I did have some occasional burning and one time was felt like diaper rash on my butt. It was a hot humid summer in New York, so this didn’t seem too strange. Any time I felt something weird, my boyfriend would get down there with a flashlight and check it out. He always decided things looked fine and he still wanted to have sex. After a few months my boyfriend got a blood test for hsv2 which was negative. We figured this meant I was probably negative since we had been having lots of unprotected sex, even when I had what felt like similar yeast infections. (I have always been very prone to them.) However, I have now been having burning in my vaginal area off and on for several months. There is no odor or discharge associated with this burning, and it is generalized over my entire vagina. The burning is worse after I pee, not on my urethra, but on my labia. Twice I went to my dr for this, the first time I was diagnosed with a uti, which I thought was strange since I get them all the time and this didn’t feel like one. The second time (new dr) she said everything looked totally normal. Most recently, I started to feel the burning again and I got out the mirror and flashlight. I found two tiny little white bumps that looked like the regular kinda “chicken skin” bumps that we have all over our genital skin, just slightly raised. Again, the size of a pinhead. No redness this time. This was on a Saturday, and I told myself I would go to the dr Monday, finally get a swab, and have some diffinitive answers. Although I wasn’t sure there was really anything to break open and swab. But by Monday the tiny bumps were gone, although the burning persisted. Tuesday I got my period. The burning is very mild now, but worse after I pee, and it hurts a little to put tampons in and take them out, mostly at the opening of my vagina. The pain and burning is not localized to any “spots” but generalized over my entire vagina. I had this kind of pain inserting my tampons during my period once a couple months ago as well. It feels similar to when my vagina is very dry. Could I be suffering from vaginal dryness? Or could this general burning and sensitivity be herpes outbreaks? Could these tiny bumps that I have noticed that lasted 2 days be herpes? I have considered getting the blood test again, but my dr says it won’t really tell us anything. It would be great to know my status definitively, but my real concern is knowing if/when I’m having an outbreak so that I don’t pass it to my partner. Also, if these are simply mild outbreaks, I can stop going to the dr and getting tested for a million things every time i have this burning. I have not experienced any tingling, numbness or itching, or noticed anything that I perceived as a “blister” or “lesion.” I’m not sure if I am being over or under cautious.

I was pretty drunk but the sex was protected regardless but there was a bit of touching before this, I took my period a few days after and was feeling a burning sensation when urinating but thought nothing of it. Now my period has been over for a few days but the burning sensation is still there. I had a check last night and I've noticed some small bumps around the vaginal/rectal area, they look like little spots and this whole area is hurting me when I go to the toilet or even go to touch it. I initially started googling and it leads me straight to herpes every time. However, The pictures I've viewed have different resemblance to mine.The whole area feels sort of raw and that's the only way I can describe it? I've never experienced anything like this before and I always shave my vagina as well, so I'm not sure if these are ingrown hairs or something worse, especially because I often shave every time I feel hair regrowth. I'm going to get checked at an STI clinic regardless but I feel very embarrassed and annoyed and disappointed with myself because it had been so long since I had sex with anyone and now this has happened.

The two first times where infection so the doctor gave me antibiotics. Its been a year and recently i noticed my urine to be cloudy again so i went to doctor. Did a test again plus a sonography. He didn't give me antibiotics and suggested that i drink more water. Im just worried that maybe my urince getting cloudy/infection frequently has something to do with the skin to skin i had with that girl.

Sexual Health & STDs,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/33622/possible-to-have-herpes-on-nipples-and-areola,Possible to have Herpes on nipples and areola?,"Hi  I'm totally devastated right now. Last Nov 25, I had sore and lesions around my big nipples. Both of my nipples. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I EVER HAD THIS IN MY LIFE. A day before that, I made love to my husband. That was the last sex I had with him before this condition happened. We almost do this at least 3 times a week. He loved sucking my big nipples using his teeth and I had a feeling that's the reason why it got aggravated. Again, we have been doing this. On the 26th, I felt the pain more - like a stabbing pain. I suspected it got worse coz of my tight-fitting shirt and my bra. I decided to wear loose shirt and then apply bacitracin. Moreover, to soothe the pain, I cleaned it using water with apple cider vinegar and then apply some coconut oil because I suspected it to be a fungal/yeast infection caused by candida, or a nipple thrush, even if I'm not lactating (based on my research, possible to have it even for non-lactating women).  Then on the 27th, I felt better with the help of that coconut oil but the pain is still there and it's manageable. And then I noticed white bumps. One white bump on my left areola then 2 on my right areola. Pls note, this does not look like tiny blister in cluster forms. They looked like some sort of a hair follicle infection – well at least to me. You know, those dots around the areola? I believe that's an areolar gland. So, that's where the bumps are. Then on my left breast, it has some redness. I got panicked coz I began to think it could be breast inflammatory cancer or what so we decided to go the hospital on the 28th.  At the emergency, the doctor asked me for any symptoms. I don't feel any weirdness going on my body, like fatigue, loss of appetite or fever. I felt normal except this pain I have with my nipples and areola. The doctor could not say what this could be so she suggested me to have swab test on these bumps by breaking them. (Man, it hurt! I thought I have to undergo mammogram/MRI screening, etc. But nope!) One for herpes through viral culture test and the other one is for bacterial infection. Then, she gave me a prescription for a 4-mix cream, which includes anti-bacterial cream, desitin, chlotrimazole and hydrocortisone. I applied this twice a day and I could see the progress. A day after that, the ER doctor referred me to an infectious disease specialist while waiting for the results. Basically, she is also unaware about my condition and can't rule out yet. But she said it COULD NOT BE HERPES. So, I was glad to hear that. She prescribed me an oral antibacterial pills for 5 days. Again, I saw some progress. My nips and areola began to heal.  Then today, I felt like they are doing pretty well now but I still continued applying that 4-mix cream. My happiness subsided when I received a phone call from that specialist and told me that I have a positive result for HERPES TYPE1 and positive result on bacterial infection. Like WHAT?!!! I was so emotional and depressed. I have a prescription called acyclovir but I did not take it. Due to that, I wasn't able to ask these questions to my doctor. Appreciate if you could enlighten me this. And sorry for a long post. 1. Is it possible really to have herpes type 1 on your nipples and areola? Before this condition happened, I had an IgG blood test and it was negative for both types 1 and 2 last Jan 2016. I took this test coz my GYN told me to do so as I had some sort of a cut in my genital area. My husband also had a negative result. AND NOW, a positive result through viral culture test. HOW COULD THIS BE POSSIBLE? I only have a monogamous relationship. But my hubby got 2 other relationships before me. He did not notice any abnormalities like cold sores happened on his body throughout his life. 2. Herpes type 1 is not an STD-type of thing? 3. This is still unacceptable for me. For how long should I wait til I have that next IgG blood test again? I wanna ensure if these lab test results are accurate. 4. Speaking of accuracy, is the viral culture test reliable? Can it be a false positive? 5. Are there any other reliable tests to prove if one (who is not experiencing any symptoms) is positive or negative herpes aside from this viral culture test and blood test? I'm talking about after the outbreak. Like if you don't feel any symptoms, yet you want to know if there are herpes anti-bodies present. 6. How can you tell if it's herpes? Like I said, I felt tingling and painful sensation, a bit of redness only on my one breast, lesions around my nipples and some white bumps. But these white bumps are not in cluster form though…. With the help of the cream, it somehow worked. Now, they looked ok and normal to me. Do you think it really is herpes based on my description? 7. Lastly, we do kiss a lot too and even do oral sex. But no cold sores or whatsoever for both of us. Do you think this positive result viral culture test could be WRONG? 8. That Acyclovir, what is it for? And when will you apply it? Like once you feel the symptoms or if blisters are now appearing? Thank you!",

Since I was -3- years old, I have gotten pains in my legs that would cause me to cry until my father or mother would massage them in the middle of the night until the pain went away. (Doctors said it was ""growing pains"" and that they would go away by the time I was 12.) Around the time I hit 8/9 years old, I began to develop the pain in my feet as well and I learned to somehow cope with the pain by locking my self in the bathroom crying and squeezing my leg to compress the pains. By the time I was 12, I had begun to develop the pain in my arms, hands, knees, shins, forearms, feet, toes & fingers, and occasionally my shoulders. My pains were beginning to worsen and I would cry at night and just take the chew able Tylenol tablets my parents would give me. I am now 21, I still get pains all throughout my bones/body, not JUST joints. I have managed to have a high pain tolerance because of these pains and can feel the pains coming about 20 minutes before they start hurting bad in this case I will take Aleve (Naproxen) to soothe my pains.

She told me to go see a physical therapist for pelvic floor therapy but they were booked out for months and weren’t able to give me information on another place or when I would be able to come in.

I have not seen the radiology report, this is just me looking at the disc myself and Google. I did have my chiropractor look at it and he confirmed my thoughts. The nerve going to the right is getting cut off at the higher level. The lowers are cutting into the left. So I have pain going down both arms but more severely with my right.  I've had chronic pain with this for 7 years. Seeking multiple forms of treatment. Most recently daily ibuprofen and bi-weekly therapeutic massage and chiro adjustments have kept things manageable. However this particular ""flare up"" has been over the top enough for me to go back to pain management. My quality of life has been severely impacted. Pain mgmt ordered the MRI. So now they'll have three MRIs to compare, 7 years ago, 4 years ago and now. The radiology report always says ""mild"" and I always think if it's so mild why does is hurt so freakin bad?! My chiro thinks stepping it up a notch to an epidural steroid injection is the next step. Pain management also sees that as a good option. I've been to PT, two ortho Drs, two chiros, several massage therapists. I've tried narcotic pain meds, muscle relaxers (flexeril, skelaxin), ultram.

Long story short, met a girl, second date she had a cold sore in the final/healing stage. It wasn't weeping/wet, had a scab on it, pinkish/redish skin, looked like a cut. Had a great time, some alcohol, we end up kissing a lot. Scab fell of easily.  My question is this. At the healing stage, the spot not wet, how likely is transmission of hsv-1 to me? If after I washed the areas she contacted would that have done anything? Also question if immune system factors in to transmission, as I have been taking immune system boosting supplements. Know getting hsv-1 isn't the end of the world and most of the population has it, just if I had a chance to avoid it I'd like to. Know we shouldn't of kissed with a mark present but it didn't look bad and she's really an awesome girl so wasn't really thinking I guess. If I don't see anything by 20 days after exposure, should I just stop worrying about it? It's been almost 3 days and nothing so far.  Also, don't know if this is a factor, probably not but trying to be concise with info, but it was on the corner of her mouth at the lower lip, so don't know how much I would have contacted that spot. I'm no expert, it looked like it was healing, but what if it wasn't at that stage? I saw a small scab at the top and a rough line of intended red skin below, like a shallow cut I guess, assumed the scab meant healing stage. What if it was an earlier stage? Do I have a higher chance? And finally, what if it was HSV-2? Know that's rare on the mouth, but IF it was that could it just as easily take hold from romantic kissing?",
Sexual Health & STDs,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/51547/erratic-period-and-weird-vaginal-discharge,Erratic period and weird vaginal discharge.,"Recently, I have been getting very irregular periods. I am 20 years old, and had periods since I was a teenager. For the past two years, I have always had regular periods (28days), and most periods started on the expected date, while some were early or late only be one or two days.  My (usual) PMS symptoms are: cramping, mood swings, and discharging of large amounts of fluid from the vagina. Also, usually during mensuration, I have cramping and mood swings.  However, since February, these things started to change: On February, my period was supposed to start on February 27th, but started on the 24th. Not only was the period 3 days early (which has almost never happened to me before), but I also did not have any PMS symptoms before menstruation (but still had extreme cramping during the menstruation).  Then, the next period, which should've started on March 24th, started on April 5th, almost 2 weeks late. This time, I experienced very little PMS symptoms, and during menstruation, had the same amount of extreme cramping. Lastly, my period is supposed to start on May 3rd, but it still isn't starting(meaning that my period is three days late), and I feel no cramping whatsoever. (no signs of PMS) However, I urinate more frequently, and the bottom part of my vagina hurts (it has a stinging sensation). Also, when I urinate or hold my urine, that stinging pain becomes more painful. Additionally, the left side of my pelvis feels like it’s being pressured (that pain increases when I lie down).  Also, regarding the fluid that is discharged from my vagina (which I have mentioned above) Usually, that fluid is mostly transparent and white, odorless, and is discharged in large amounts during menstruation. However, during the last couple of weeks, it has become yellow, form small chunks (like smashed tofu), and smells like fish. Also, instead of discharging lots of that fluid during menstruation, they were discharged in large amounts since two weeks ago (two weeks ‘before’ the expected period). They were discharged in very large amounts). Then once the expected period date arrived, they are almost not being discharged at all(but it still smells like fish). The length of mensturation remains the same (5 days)  When I was in 9th grade, because my cramping during and menstruation was so severe, I had an ultrasound test to check if the excessive amount of pain was due to any secondary causes (such as diseases). However, the ultrasound confirmed that I had no such diseases. (Although this test was done a few years ago, I am still bringing this up just in case it may help)  What could be causing these irregularities in the timing of my period and the change in the fluid in the vagina? I mean, for two whole years, my period and everything stayed relatively constant, then all of a sudden, the PMS symptoms are different, the days are not periodic, and the vaginal discharge has changed.  **Also, I had my first sex a weeks ago. Could this be the cause? Please don't be afraid to make guesses or ask questions, as I'm guessing that the information that I have posted enough may not be sufficient enough for a full examination.

I am 20 years old, and started having periods since a teenager. For the past two years, I have always had regular periods (28days), and almost 99% of all periods were right on time.(not even a day early or late). Also, I have severe stomachache before and during my period (I also have mood swings). However, recently, this changed.  On Feburary, my period was supposed to start on Februrary 28th, but started on the 24th. Not only was the period 4 days early(which has almost never happend to me before) but I had almost no PMS before the period...  Then, the next period, which should've occured on MArch 24th, started on April 5th, almost 2 weeks late. This time, I had some stomachache, but nowhere as severe as my usualy PMS.  Finally, my period is supposed to happen on May 3rd, but it still isn't starting, and I have no stomachache or cramping whatsoever. (no signs of PMS) What could be causing these irregularities in the timing of my period? I mean, for two whole years, almost not a period was late (not even a day late), but now, the days are erratic, and the PMS symptoms are different.

I have a PCP, I saw him at the end of July beginning of August. I had severe right knee pain at my first appointment. I have since injured my left knee as well about a week into being down with my right knee. I had originally in 2009 (when I first started having BAD issues) gotten injured in a car/pedestrian accident that pinned me, by my knees, between the back of a smaller truck and the front of my parked Chevy Malibu. At this time I had to have 22 stitches placed in my lower left knee area with about 6 months recovery time. I saw an orthopedic dr. within a month or two of my accident in 2009. Since then I have been a very active mother to 2 beautiful children that keep me on my toes. I was NOT doing anything that I would consider strenuous. I was playing with my children on the floor of the living room, proceeded to stand up and got about half way from sitting in an Indian style position. When I stood up, I heard a loud popping/snapping sound and had immediate searing pain radiate through my ENTIRE leg. I am having similar symptoms in both knees some days one will be worse than the other. My question is this, I have an appointment with my Orthopedic dr. on November 16 of 2016 after weeks of begging my PCP and FINALLY getting an MRI approval after EIGHT weeks or harassing the staff to push it through and figure out what it is not approved. In order to receive the MRI I will need to straighten BOTH my legs for upwards of FORTY minutes. I told the doctor this was NOT possible unless he wants to consciously sedate me. He refuses to do this, so I am stuck waiting on the couch. I have been to the Emergency Room numerous times refusing pain medications and begging for treatment of my knees, some kind of relief, any kind of relief that isn't narcotic pain medications. To which the lovely doctors respond well, it isn't bad enough to have treated on an emergent basis BUT it is bad enough to prescribe you a wheelchair. I have been to the smaller more local Emergency room that refuses to give any kind of relief or answers and my PCP is obviously NO help. Could I go to a bigger hospital with more Doctors and resources and see if they could offer some solutions?!!","Knee Pain , Chronic Pain"

Again I used creams and it is not going away. I feel like I should see a doctor and I went to see doctor on MAR 13, 2019.

All came negative and in the blood test ranges are like hsv1- 0.2 and hsv2- 0.17. Before coming the reports he asked me to use acyclovir 400mg 3/day for 5 days.

(had one wart, which i didnt knew about and cut it accidently while shaving. that did spread it everywhere). What really annoys me is all the contradictory information regarding HPV. I´m writing beneath what I found out after some research. Please correct me if i´m wrong! 1.	The “v” stands for virus, warts are just an infection of the top layer of the skin caused by the virus. Hence if your immune system supresses the virus you´ll never have warts but you could still have the virus and could spread it. 2.	You don´t test for the virus under the age of 25 because everybody, who is sexually active, has it anyways. 3.	Taking those two points into account, statistically speaking the chance of contracting HPV from someone who has warts vs someone who doesn’t have visible warts is basically the same. 4.	The HPV strains which cause warts don’t cause cancer.  5.	The correlation between HPV in men and cancer is rather sketchy.  Best regards",HPV/Genital Warts

Allergies,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/allergies/10333/bug-bites-ringworm,Bug Bites / Ringworm?,"Hello, About a week ago, I had what I believed to be bug bites starting to appear on my body, maybe 1 or 2 at a time. They were mainly on my chest, stomach, sides, and back, with only a couple on my thigh, a couple on my arms, and one on my neck. These bumps would just be an itchy spot, which I would try not to touch, and would start to slowly turn into a small welt that looked exactly like a mosquito bite over the course of an hour, but within maybe 6 hours or less would completely disappear, looking no different than a slight pinprick, or long-passed pimple.  There were maybe two times that I had 6 or more bumps at a time, but typically they appear 1-3 at a time, spread out randomly, and mainly on my chest, stomach, or back. I searched absolutely everywhere for what I had though were possibly bedbugs, mites, fleas, etc. and even using a lint roller constantly on my couch, sheets, bed, carpet, everywhere, I never find a single bug, looking as closely as possible. I tried lint rolling on my body, checked my hair meticulously, showered and it would all be consistent, maybe 1 or two appearing every few hours and disappearing shortly after. From everything I've seen, the bumps I have are always much more mild than any reports on bug bite types. Now, I'm hardly getting any more bumps, today I got my first one since yesterday, which I only had one yesterday, but I have developed 3 rashes on my back, one on its own and disappearing, and two on my back currently. I also have two on my leg, one being on my inner thigh, and one on the outer thigh. They start as mildly itchy slightly to moderately red circles about the size of a dime, and over the course of a day, it becomes about the size of a half dollar, and usually around 36 or 48 hours later the center starts clearing, leaving a ring of slightly less red, more pink, typically not itchy skin. This looks to me a lot like ringworm, and less like Lyme disease, but I don't know if it has any relation to the welts that I started with. Is that the beginning stage of ringworm, where it doesn't penetrate the surface, but once it does I start getting the rings? On the rash that turns into rings, there is a hardly noticeable texture difference between the ring skin, the skin inside the ring, and the skin outside of it. Like I said, it hardly itches, and the whole rash from beginning to end runs its course in five days or less. I've been washing my sheets, clothes, and towel every night, applying a topical ointment, washing with tea-tree oil, and ensuring that I don't itch anything at all. As one last side note, for as long as I can remember, the back of both of my heels have very dry, very hard skin. It's cracked, but only on the dead skin that has built up, it has never bothered me, but if I try to file it off, it's smooth for a week and ends up coming back. It seems to me that this is a minor case of athlete's foot, again not as bad as pictures I've seen, but I know athlete's foot is in the same fungal family as ringworm, so I'm wondering if this is related as well. The first attached image show's the bumps/welts/bites at their worst, and this only happened once. Like I said, it's only a few at a time typically. The second picture is the beginning of the rash, on Saturday at 4pm. I'm not sure how long it had been there, could have been anywhere between 1 and 6 hours most likely. The third picture is from that same rash 45 hours later, Monday at 1pm, Thanks for reading, and let me know if you have any more questions.","Hives , Allergy Testing"

Previously my libido was perfect, like I used to masturbate twice a day. But now it makes it harder for me to do it just once. I take cipralex before sleeping, so what I did was masturbate before taking the medicine and it worked.  I just want to know if these side effects will go away when I'll stop using this medicine. My doctor said its nothing to worry about (maybe she wants to calm me down), but as I am an adult now, I do have a fear of not being able to function properly sexually. I have a whole life ahead, and I cant afford to have this disability for the rest of my life. I would appreciate an experienced doctor or individual to help me out on this issue!",Men's Issues

My girlfriend and I tried to have vaginal sex twice. Prior to this I was able to finger her with no discomfort (I couldn’t do two fingers though.) I do have large hands and an above-average sized number... The first time we had no success because whenever I tried to penetrate her it caused a lot of discomfort even though we took it pretty slow and used lubricated condoms. We tried again two days later, but this time we used lube we bought from the store in addition to the lubricated condoms. I penetrated her and and she jerked back in pain. We assumed that we were a bad angle so we tried to change positions. As we were doing it I realized that she was bleeding profusely (it was bright red and didn’t stop for several hours, and she definitely wasn’t on her period.)  It’s the day after and she’s stopped bleeding. She looked in the mirror and it appears she was bleeding from her hymen. We were both virgins before and we used protection so there’s no way she has an STD. Could the discomfort she was feeling before be from her hymen? If not what could be the answer for her pain? If it is her hymen could her tearing it help with the discomfort the next time we try? We are going to wait several weeks before we try again. I just hope she can finally enjoy herself when we do because I don’t want to have anxiety about accidentally hurting her.",

I don’t know if this is normal or I have a health problem. I’m asking here because I’ve looked it up and I’m not getting many helpful answers :( so maybe it would be better to describe my specific case: I would like to try having sex with my boyfriend. I have been masturbating for several years and can give myself an orgasm easily by stimulating the clitoris (it feels really nice and healthy for me and I would like to try and go the “whole way” as a change to see what that also feels like). However, we have never had actual penetrative sexual intercourse even though we have been trying for about 7 months - this is because it is so extremely painful for me whenever he attempts to enter me. I get a very painful sharp, stabbing kind of pain along with a burning feeling. It gets so bad that I have ended up screaming or crying a few times from how painful it is. It feels like I’m being torn in half. Some of these times I have urged him through tears to keep trying and push it in despite the pain but it just won’t go in. It feels sometimes like my body is rejecting having something inside it. The furthest he has ever got inside me was the tip of his penis.  I went to a doctor about it and:  I was asked, is there enough foreplay? Am I naturally lubricated enough? I think I am, and I have used artificial lubricant as well because it helps. I feel very ready and ‘in the mood’ before we try it, it’s just when it actually happens that the pain comes in. I don’t get the same “sandpaper” feeling some women get either.  I know I don’t have a sexually transmitted infection because my boyfriend has never had a sexual partner in any way before me and vice versa.  The doctor told me that if I can insert a tampon, I do not have a serious health issue like vaginismus. I had never used tampons before, but I tried it, and it went in fine, a bit of discomfort but no pain.   After this I tried using a toy since it is a bit bigger than a tampon (but still quite a bit smaller than the real thing). It went in fine, the same as the tampon, with a bit of discomfort but still no pain.  Although this is all fine, whenever I try with my boyfriend it is always the same - unbearably painful, and every time has started to feel like an ordeal even though I am the one asking him to try it. I feel really disheartened about the whole thing. I feel like I will never be able to have sex or enjoy it. I feel like I should just tell my boyfriend that I want to give up trying and just go without - but the idea of it is really disappointing, he and I wanted to experience this very normal and healthy part of adult life together.  Thank you for reading, if anyone has any idea about what could be wrong it is much appreciated! I am so stuck on what to do, and I want to know if I am normal!",Women's Issues

Brain & Nervous System Disorders,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/74372/numbness-muscle-twitching-and-no-diagnosis-read-this,"Numbness, muscle twitching, and no diagnosis?  Read this.","I felt compelled to write this a year and a half after first experiencing neurological issues because #1, it seems that a lot of folks who have similar undiagnosed conditions simply ""disappear"" online (hopefully that means they've gotten better), and #2, I am still alive after a year and a half, so my goal is to give hope to anyone who is experiencing similar symptoms and have not had any luck with a diagnosis.  First things first. If you have not seen any neurologists, stop reading now and don't do any more research until that appointment. Otherwise, you will go through torturous anxiety and sleepless nights as you try to self-diagnose and likely settle on the worst-case scenario. My post is for those who have had all of the tests done and seen multiple doctors and still have no diagnosis.  My two biggest, longest lasting symptoms were (and occasionally still are) numbness and muscle twitching. It started off as numbness in my left toe, slowly progressing to my left foot, left leg, left arm, left side of the face and even the entire head at times (rarely all at once though). I started getting it in the right side of my body occasionally, but there it typically stayed in my right fingertips. The twitching also appeared in various parts of the body, but really chose to settle in my right arm between my triceps and elbow. It twitched nearly nonstop, 24/7 for 4-5 months straight. While these were the longest lasting symptoms, I encountered a TON of other symptoms. While concerning, these didn’t last months like the numbness and twitching. I will include that list below my signature.  During about a year’s time, I had 2 MRIs on my brain and neck, two different EMGs on both sides of the body, strength tests, probably a dozen or so various blood tests, and an EKG. Everything came back clean. I saw 2 different neurologists and 2 different general doctors. None of them could piece anything together. One of my neurologists wouldn't even look at my twitching arm. “If you can do a push up, sit up, and squat, you don't have ALS,” he assured me. So while every doctor failed to come up with what was going on, none of them seemed overly concerned. In a way, it is a relief to know your doctors aren’t concerned. On the other hand, if they don’t know what it is, then how do they know it’s not fatal?! Before I move on to what finally “cured” me, I need to pause and say… trust your doctors, esp. if they are all saying the same thing. Spending a few hours or even a few days researching WebMD, message boards, etc., does not put us on the same standing as neurologists who have spent YEARS studying these conditions. You have to trust them and have a little faith, esp. if they are saying you are OK. I also know that none of what I’m saying is truly going to convince you that you might not have a terrible disease - I wasn't able to be convinced at first either. They only thing you can truly do is wait it out.  OK, the good stuff. By a fluke chance, I shared my issues and concerns with a co-worker, who suggested that I see a particular doctor in Houston who has a knack for diagnosing things that other doctors can’t. I didn’t get my hopes up but decided to go see him anyway. He took a look at all of my test results over the past year, sent me for a couple more random blood tests, which came back clean, and then told me that he has seen what I have before. It doesn’t even have a name yet! It is a virus and has a transient nature, which explains why the symptoms manifest in different ways and in different places. Furthermore, it is going to take a couple of more years to fully get it out of my system. Annoying? Yes! But at least he gave me hope, which is something I couldn’t get anywhere else. He told me that it’s hard to do, but if I could find a way to laugh with the twitching, to do so (I know, that is impossible), because while with some diseases, twitching is a bad thing, in this case, it is a good thing and is my body’s way of rewiring itself so to speak. So, I’m still not filling confident at this point, but he said he wants to start me on prescription grade magnesium (Mag Oxide, 400 mg), and that if that doesn’t help with the twitching, that he had a less conventional idea. Well, to my surprise, one or two days after taking the magnesium, the twitching stopped almost completely! Mind you, none of my previous tests showed any sort of magnesium deficiency. As a side note, I will still get random twitches every now and then, but they are usually short-lived and nothing more than just a few seconds. But the nonstop twitching has been gone for probably 8 months or so. (I still wonder what his other idea would have been if the magnesium wouldn’t have worked!) So anyway, if you are in the same boat as I am/was, not finding any results and all of your tests coming back clean, ask your doctor if he can try you on a high dosage of magnesium. You certainly don’t have anything to lose.  I want to end this with some self-reflection that has come out of this ordeal with me. This was an extremely scary season for me and forced me to ask some tough questions about life and what really matters. What I learned was whether I have a neurological disease now or not, the fact remains that at some point, I AM going to die. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter if that happens while I am young, middle-aged, or old... the same fate awaits us all. Depressing, yes, but true nonetheless. If you are battling an unknown condition and have extreme anxiety and fear, my advice is to take this time and current health scare to settle the score now. Are you religious? Find out what you truly believe and hopefully this strengthens your faith in the end. Religious or not, try to find beauty in the day to day and focus each day on what truly matters. If and when you come out of this ordeal, be it a year or longer, come back and share your story with others to give them hope. And please don't forget those who truly are suffering with serious diseases such as ALS. Pray for them, encourage them, donate to ALS research, volunteer your time, etc. All the vows you made and said you'd do if only you didn't have the fatal disease? Do them. With whatever time you have left, love God and love others and leave the world a better place. Good luck! DC Other symptoms besides numbness and muscle twitching: Long lasting: High blood pressure; rash in left armpit that lasted months but eventually went away; Left leg tingly, almost like an internal vibration; Psychological issues (Anxiety, Stress, Detached feeling, Overwhelmed, Fear)   Shorter lived: Sensation of lump in my throat, slow swallowing, sometimes with a dull pain that came and went; Muscle and joint pain (shoulders, calves, right arm, muscle near thumb on right hand, finger joints); Waking up with right little and ring fingers completely numb; Electric jolt-like feeling in right side of neck; Loss of appetite and weight loss; Insomnia; Fatigue; Palpitations; Light headed; Stammering for words; Neck pain; Chest pains",

The issue started after I had the most horrendous UTI in late January. The first antibiotics I was given did not work for my infection and the UTI started to become a kidney infection as well, so I went back to the doctor and got new antibiotics and everything started to clear up right away. However, ever since then I've been experiencing just some general vaginal discomfort. It ISN'T itchy, and I wouldn't necessarily classify it as a burning sensation either, it's just uncomfortable. It seems to be most prevalent first thing in the morning and then again in the evenings, with some normalization during mid-day. Other than this I don't seem to have any other vaginitis symptoms. I have used at home tests to test my ph, both urine and the actual vagina, and both are in normal range. Is it possible to have some sort of infection when your ph is in normal range? One other thing to note is that I don't tend to have symptoms when I have a yeast infection. The one time I was told I had a yeast infection by a doctor was when I went for a completely unrelated reason and they drew some blood and told me I had a yeast infection as well, even though I had ZERO symptoms. I've been scouring the internet like crazy, researching BV/Yeast infections/UTIs, hoping to find an answer as to what is wrong with me but can't find anything that is similar to my case. Really the only symptom is vaginal discomfort. It's made me weary about having sex with my husband and has been a real damper on our physical relationship. I'm stressed and he is worried about making anything worse.  I'm really hoping for some insight from the internet, and I know everyone is going to say ""Go to your doctor,"" but I can't because I don't have any insurance. Going to the clinic twice before for that UTI already hurt my wallet and I'm afraid if I go again and they check my ph that shows no sign of infection they're going to say nothing is wrong or at least nothing that they can see, and then I'll have to say goodbye to another $100. As soon as I have insurance I will be finding an OBGYN, but at this point it's not possible. But is just simple vaginal discomfort a sign of anything when you have no other symptoms and it's been going on for a couple months? Please Help!

For the past year or two I’ve been urinating excessively. I had it checked out but after recieving no real solution from my doctors, I brushed it off. I don’t have any pain or irritation when I pee, but I feel the urge often enough for it to have gotten in the way of work and school (I feel the urge to go 2 or more times in an hour). I especially have to go at night. Whenever I go I don’t have much trouble starting, and a good bit comes out with a decently strong stream. I asked my doctor about this and had a uroflow to test the strength of my stream. They said it was somewhat unusual in that it wavered some amount, but nothing worth concerning beyond that. My prostate was also examined by a urologist who mentioned it was mushy, but said I was too young for there to be any possible problem with it. My blood was tested and no STDs or diabetes, so dead end there. Recently though I’ve been feeling less sexually driven and have been producing less seman than is usual for me. My urologist said it could be possible blockage that’s keeping the urine from coming out in a constant stream, but that makes no sense to me given the frequency that I’m going and the fact that there’s no pain. I’m starting to believe it’s either A) hormonal, or B) actually does have something to do with my prostate. What causes a mushy prostate at such a young age, and why didn’t my urologist see it as a problem? Again, 19 y/o male. Mentally and physically healthy. I need some help here. Thanks.",Men's Issues

Guess I'll start typing and when I get to it, I'll tell ya. It's rather embarrassing and awkward. I'm 39-year-old married guy, who has a very unusual sex life. I cannot emphasize this more. I was never sexually educated when I was younger. I used pornography as a sort of ""guide"". Genre pornography I find so fascinated are oral sex and manual stimulation. However, I can't seem to figure out why? Which has left me with many, unanswered questions, questions that anybody, without the exception of me of course, should know? Things like, what does foreplay involve besides kissing and caressing? How long am I expected to be down between my wife's legs? Why do I not get excited when I’m touching her? It is not linked to my wife, she finds having intercourse enjoyable, I do not. So the problem is not applied to her.  My wife like so many has occasionally performed Fellatio. I have heard so many guys, reading from forums that is, how much enjoyment they have from this. I do not. Mainly because I can't keep an erection when she does this. Weird, right? Nor can I ejaculate when this occurs. What is the correct response? All I do is stare at her like she is doing something wrong. I've tried several times to shut my eyes, you know like they do in ""dirty movies"", but still I can't find any enjoyment of this.  I have told her how this has occurred prior to getting married. Same problem. It's like some kind of sexual block. And no I had never been sexually abused. There are a lot of sexual activities I do not enjoy, for example, when she performs an oral sex act by (allowing) me to insert my testicles into her mouth. It is painful. Also, whenever I obtain an erection, my penis will swell and begin to pulsate very tensely. When this happens, it's indescribably painful.

It was swift, sudden...little time to react. I know, they say, never try to break up a dogfight. but that's pretty much impossible to follow when your dog is being mauled by a junkyard hound.  So, I saved my buddy...unfortunately, though, at the expense of the a large portion of the tip of my thumb and nail. Needless to say, blood, everywhere.  Despite my wife's pleas and, since it was an open wound, I decided to not go to emergency. I got a tetanus shot about 8 years, before, and the dogs were up to date on shots...so, i ""treated"", myself. Protected the wound with bandages. Cleaned it twice daily in warm salt water (screams!). Drank my body weight in water (170 ozs/day). Absolutely no processed sugar, whatsoever. Plenty of rest.  After three weeks, wound is healing, nicely. Skin is growing back. Feeling is slowly returning. Nail is growing back, well. No more pain. I can swing a golf club (Tiger (in the) Woods!). I'm well on my way to a full recovery after a very serious injury! About six months ago, one of my dogs developed a problem that he never experienced, before... He started to make a big mess in the middle of the night. It was sporadic, though. He would go three, four days with no signs of loose stools, then, BAM!!! Why??? What's the root cause? No change in his diet (egg, brown rice, steamed kabocha, mixed veggies, a little tuna fish and 33% dog kibble). No change in weight. Incredible appetite. Coat, skin, eyes, everything, perfect, for a ten year old dog... I'll cut to the end to prevent boredom. After 3 months of insane observation, perplexing trials and error with diet and, taking him outside a 2am in the morning, I finally figured out the problem: Fleas I wanted to resolve this problem, myself. I knew this was a complex problem. Very little google chit chat to help on ""intermittent diarrhea in dogs"" to help. My dogs are incredibly healthy and well cared for. And, I'm against any kind of drugs or medications...on, myself, my family and, especially, my dogs! Therefore, no vets. If there's nothing on the internet, how much could a vet help if he/she  would see my dog for 10 minutes? Besides, like I said, no other tell tale issues besides the doo... Anyway, cut to the chase, when my dog was scratching, I quickly laid him down and hunted the fleas. If have two dogs but this one is highly sensitive (allergic) to flea bites. Thus, when he got bit, he'd scratch, incessantly. If he had fleas, he couldn't sleep... If he couldn't sleep............he'd develop digestive ""issues"".  So, ""WHY"", now?  Simple.

Last year my pap smear was normal and I haven’t had different sexual partner in over 6 years. When the nurse told me the doctor suggested colposcopy I asked if i have hpv and she said ‘I didn’t said that’ she said the doctor wants to know what is causing changes in the cervix. What that means I don’t have hpv but she still wants to do unnecessary procedures on me.So my question is if this is normal to have colposcopy without couple of abnormal Pap smears??

No doctor ever took me seriously because I'm still young (33 years old), blamed it on anxiety and then said I had asthma.  A few weeks ago I blacked out while driving, that was my third blackout within 2 months. They did a 3 day holter monitor and saw that my heart rate dropped to 46 beats a minute, I have a first degree AV block, low frequency ventricular ectopy and sinus arrhythmia throughout. A week later (1 week ago), they implanted a Medtronic reveal linq cardiac monitor to watch my heart rate over a longer period (up to 3 years).  Online I read that patients will receive a monitor which transmits data to the cardiologist 24/7. I only received a patient assistant with which I can record 4 episodes of symptoms every 6 months. What's the point of that? What if I have more episodes? Or a very low heart rate/irregular heartbeat without symptoms? Do I just ignore it? Why would they implant a device like that and then don't monitor results? I don't want this monitor inside of my body if I can only record 4 episodes every 6 months. I have symptoms every single week. They also never explained anything to me.

So he says I may have some kind of heart thing where it skips a beat or whatever, can't recall the name (right?) but he said probably nothing to worry about but I can do an echo if I want. He said it would probably just make me more anxious but it was up to me. I declined.  He does think I would benefit from a stress test, which I still have to schedule.  But I have been having this fake burping thing where I just have to feel like relieving stress in my upper chest, like air trapped there and will burp air, not a belch, just like I make myself do it, vs. have to and usually a bunch in a row which annoys my wife who always asks ""am I making you nervous?""

I have Googled, asked everyone I know including a few nurses and her doctors, I have even read medical books! Since she has had both heart issues and breathing issues, I figured Heart Health was the appropriate place to post this. To start with, she will be 62 in September and has for the most part been in perfect health her entire life. Her immune system is a ROCK, she NEVER gets sick even though she works in a school where kids are sick all the time. She has always been a smoker, a pack a day or sometimes less. Always had a ton of ambition, has worked full time for as long as I can remember and used to work two jobs when I was little. She is less than two months away from retirement!  It all began around 6 months ago, she started developing a nasty cough. We figured it was caused by her smoking, so I told her it was time to quit! She cut down, first to around 5 cigarettes a day, then to 1 or 2. It did no good at all with the cough, it actually got worse and she started to lose energy mid day and was very tired and lathargic at night. This persisted for a few months, so she went to the doctors. The doctor seemed to think it was caused by acid reflux and prescribed her medication for that. It seemed to help a little, but not much. Her vitamin D was also low, so she was prescribed a supplement to take each day. None of this was really helping the problem, still coughing, still low energy later in the day but felt fine early in the day. Then one morning things got worse quick, she called me and said she wasn't feeling right and needed me to check on her (I live right next door). So I ran over as fast as I could, she couldn't stand up and walk without getting weak and falling down, she was sweating bad, dizzy, heart racing. I called 911 immediately and she was brought to the local hospital, diagnosed with AFIB. I thought this could be part of the answer, the lack of oxygen to her blood is causing her fatigue, which has been the most crippling part of all of this! She was given Xarelto and a few other meds, I know she was given a blood thinner, maybe that is what the Xarelto is? Anyways, after staying there for 48 hours, she was sent home! When she first got home she was feeling a little better, she went back to work after a few days and I figured half the battle was won! This sadly has not been the case, as the cough had gotten worse, as had her breathing. A lot of the time she was wheezing, especially during a coughing spell. The cough is productive, as it does produce phglehm but it never seems to get better and in fact, worsens. She hadn't been able to sleep a full night in over 2 months at that time, it has effected her sleeping down to maybe 4-5 hours a night, sometimes less! Then about 2 1/2 weeks ago, she had a doctors appointment. At this point she had been working most days, she has as many sick days as she needs to take off before retirment but being they were intended to pay for her health insurance, she don't want to use all of them. When she got to the doctors, they found an alarming abnormality in her EKG and wanted her to go to a hospital immediatly! This time they sent her to a hospital around 50 miles away, that specializes in heart health. The hospital is well known for it's cardiac unit and I figured she was in good hands and maybe we could finally get some answers! They did an EKG there, said it was fine, blamed it on the doctors offices EKG machine and said her heart was fine. We asked what was causing the fatigue and cough to get worse and he acted like he couldn't even look at it! Basically said since he checked her heart and it was fine, he wasn't doing anything else. Not check her breathing, not refer her to anyone, nothing! There were over a DOZEN overdoses in the emergency department during the time we were there and they seemed to take precidence over her, which is absolutely obsurd! At any rate, we left there with no more information than we had, her coughing getting more persistant to the point it makes her chest hurt from coughing so much and her fatigue getting worse! Was NOT impressed by that hospital and as I have chosen not to put them on blast, if you live in central NY, ask and I shall tell! As the past two weeks have went on, she has gotten even worse. Now just walking from her chair to the bedroom and back or through the store has her out of breath. She feels normal when she is sitting or lying down, besides the cough. She just has NO energy to do anything, even talk much sometimes. Gets winded and starts wheezing walking a short distance, especially in the heat. To recap, before 5 days ago we knew almost nothing of what is causing this. A week ago she went in and had a chest X-ray done, nothing abnormal came up on that. She had a breathing test done and her breathing is at 50% capacity. Her doctor ordered for her to have a CAT scan done 5 days ago, she went and had it done at our local hospital then came home. She couldn't have been home an hour and they called her up, wanted her to come back in right then to talk about the results! I was freaking out! All I could think was lung cancer as my brother died at 35 from germ cell carcinoma of the lungs. Turned out they found ""abnormal tissue"" at the base of her esophagaus. Her lymph nodes at the site were also swollen, which for whatever reason alarmed the doctors. This is what they are saying is causing the cough and the lack of oxygen, making her fatigued. They told her that her lungs were in great shape, which came as a surprise being she has smoked her entire life up until recently. There were no tumors or anything at the site of the abnormal tissue, her blood work also came back great. When my brother was battling cancer, there were markers in his blood which indicated cancer, none were found in my moms blood work. She has to have a scope and a culture done on her esophagaus this coming Monday, then see an oncologist. Issue is it KEEPS getting worse and is starting to worry me greatly! Sleeping a few hours a night, falling asleep during the day, she is starting to get depressed and down in her spirits which is not like her at all. I am now doing all of the cleaning, cooking, laundry, shopping, etc... as she cannot walk far at all without being out of breathe. Absolutely do not mind at all helping her, she is just an independent person who is looking forward to enjoying her retirement! Aside from the scope Monday, no other appointments are scheduled including the oncologist appointment. All the doctors including her own, are on ""vacation"". I just see this as much more serious than they do, after losing my father to a stroke and my only sibling to cancer, I don't want to lose my mom. The worse she gets, the more I worry and make her call and try to find out ANY information on some action being taken. The ONLY thing that does help a little is a nebulizer, which she just got today. It helps her breathe better and I have noticed the cough is not so bad. Tonight she is sleeping much better, which is really good! She has two inhalers, one does not do anything, that is the twice daily one. The other is one she can take whenever she wants or a ""rescue inhaler"", that one makes her heart race and feel funny so she is not using that one. At this point, we are both very worried about what could be wrong and I am sick of watching my mother suffer while doctors take vacations! At very least, someone could look into the issue far enough to provide some relief from the symptoms! Problem is, no one even knows exactly what the problem is yet!  If anyone has any insight at all it would be GREATLY appreciated! As for immediate family, my mother and my son are ALL I have! They are almost all I have in general although I feel I should mention, my moms parents are still alive. My grandmother is 87 and my grandfather is 92! My great grandparents also died in their 90's, so living to be very old runs in my moms family. Good health runs in her family, there are no genetic diseases or cancer in her family history at all, other than diabetes. This is why I do not get why her health is slipping so quickly.... She was fine 7 months ago, now she can't even do most things for herself? Seeing this is killing me and the doctors aren't a ton of help or in a big hurry around here, which I personally feel they should be! Please if you have any suggestions or insight I would love to hear it, thank you!",AFib

She has Juv. RA, and has been on some pretty heavy meds her whole life. We suspect that this has caused these issues. She has tried Gluten free, cutting out dairy and many, many, other things. One thing we seem to be noticing, is a negative affect after stopping a course of antibiotics. For example, she had major jaw surgeries X4 over the past few months. They had her automatically start a course of antibiotics after the surgeries to prevent infection. While on the antibiotics, her GI symptoms largely disappear. However, when she stops antibiotics, she starts having trapped gas feelings / pressure in her abdomen. To the point of putting pressure on her bladder and causing her to have to urinate every 5 to 10 minutes. And very little urine is produced when she goes. She is seeing a very prominent GI doctor who will occasionally, when her symptoms start acting up, will prescribe Rifaxin (sp). She feels as close to 100% as she is capable while on it, usually a 2 week course I think, but then afterwards she will rebound in the other direction and have the severe pains. She's tried probiotics, Gas X, and many other things. We don't know what to do. Her quality of life is horrible when she's like this.

We both are getting past the acceptance stage and are preparing for our new reality. Whats important now I think is how we move forward with our health and intimacy. My wife HSV 1 was 48.1 and HSV 2 was 1.1, Mine was HSV1 3.8 & HSV2 4.8. What does all this mean, the numbers? Also can we effect each others number or reinfect each other worse, should we use condoms to protect one another?

Hepatitis C,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/hepatitis-c/34138/hep-c-genotype-4-info,Hep C Genotype 4 info,"Hello Everyone,  I was diagnosed with Hep C Genotype 4 in 1995. I was told that I have a RARE EUROPEAN Strain. I then proceeded to ignore it until very recently.  The very 1st thing I learned was that Genotype 4is not RARE or a EUROPEAN STRAIN. its more prevalent in Egypt so calling it a RARE EGYPTIAN STRAIN would be more correct.  What I find EXTREMELY PUZZLING is that I managed to contract anything considered RARE or EGYPTIAN since the reason I was exposed to Hep C was by being a Heroin addict of the most ordinary type. Nothing special or unique about me at all.  It reminds me of my cat. His name is Sausage and I adopted him and he brother Dude 2 years ago.  Dude is a grey Tabby and that's very common but Sausage is a Calico. A MALE Calico and that's very RARE indeed.  Our vet says that in her 20 + years of experience Sausage is the first she has ever seen. That's pretty darn rare.  About as unusual as Genotype 4 I think.  If anyone wants to know absolutely anything about Calico's or cats (of any color) then I'm your girl. I know A LOT about cats. But... if ANYONE can tell me ANYTHING about Hep C Genotype 4 specifically I'd be very grateful. I know next to nothing about that. Well, THANKS for your time.

Results:  HBsAg: negative HBsAb: 140 IU/L HBcAb: positive I have done research into the interpretation of These results and I’m lead to believe that the presence of HBsAb and a negative HBsAg shows I am immune and that I cannot infect others with the disease, is this correct?  My doctor also said I was immune and that I likely cannot transmit the infection to another person. If this is so am I cured of the disease?

Prior to diagnoses she had full body aches and we could not understand why. As she has visited rheumatologist in her blood test we saw AST = 850 ALT = 2200 and so we rushed her to check for hepatitis and the answer was positive.  Now, because of high ALT and AST they have told her to be hospitalized to stay under observation of the doctors. And so she did. But as she stayed in the hospital they did not do much to her, they gave her strong painkillers for the body aches that she had for the last 3 weeks and persisted as she was in the hospital. And did some blood cleansing procedures. This lasted for the whole weekend and on Monday her ast and alt results were the same, and they said she should stay in the hospital, but we did not listen and she returned home, in a restful manner. This was a week ago, but all this time she has been testing for ast and alt and it is increasing. At his moment it is AST = 1850 ALT = 3270. And so doctors call her to go to the hospital. But no medication is given to her at all. So I want a second and more opinion on how to deal with this situation. Mainly I am confused because from what I read on the internet it should not be so complicated, hepatitis B, if it is acute, should pass away with time. Does she really need to be hospitalized? Doctors claim that only reason why they say is that of high ast and alt, but they don't give her any medications. So what is the point?  Please help with good advise, I don't know what to think or do. I need her not to suffer from the time of hospitals, but at the same time, we don't want to risk of course. But at the same time, doctors don't say any more than what I described above, and it is just not logical for me.  Please advise.

I’m overweight with my height being 5’7 and my weight at 230.  I went to the emergency room about a week ago for this pain. I was given an ECG, a chest x day and blood tests.

I then went to my regular doctor for bloodwork on my cholesterol to see if anything noticeable or off showed up but my cholesterol was 180 and all my levels were pretty normal. Nothing crazy.  Anyway, my question is what should I do next? Why am I having this pain? I do get out of breath fast from physical exertion and eating big meals gives me the sweats. I’m afraid to even attempt to exercise for fear of injuring myself or dropping dead from blowing whatever ailment this is out of wack triggering it.  If I go to a cardiologist what will they do?

I was diagnosed with hypertensive blood pressure this year in mid of February. I used to smoke sheesha a lot, have been doing it since the past 2-3 years almost every day. As soon as I got diagnosed with high blood pressure I immediately stopped smoking and tried controlling my blood pressure through several lifestyle changes such as diet, exercising, quit smoking, etc.  All of this did work for a while without medication but one day when I was driving back home I suddenly felt fast heart rate, heavy head, little short of breath kind of feeling, I got it checked at the hospital and it was my blood pressure shooting up all of a sudden although I did not even smoke or something.  The next day I went to my cardiologist who decided to put me on a very lighter dose of Diovan 80 (half dose which makes it 40mg). Nyow it has been almost 5 months since I am taking this medication. My blood pressure keeps controlled but sometimes all of sudden I feel high blood pressure symptoms I dont know why, mostly when I am driving back home and today also this happened because of which I had to stop by to the pharmacy and take my medicine. After taking my dose I felt better. Now is it actually getting worse or is it just my anxiety or something?  Because I have got Troponin, CBC, ECG, Kidney, BUN, Sodium, etc. blood tests done several times but all of my reports have come normal.  The only thing which bothers me is this can happen anytime with me even if I am with friends or out at work which can make the situation quite embarrassing for me.

Because it just makes me feel depressed at times, I did started taking anti-depressants also and I am about to quit them in a month or two as my psychiatrist says.  Google has always scared me, reading posts which say blood pressure cannot be cured once you get it, bla bla it all just makes me upset.

It's a ""natural method"" of penis enlargement as I was very insecure of my size at the time. You basically use lube to ""milk"" the blood forward in the penis and trap it there. I followed all precautions but never the less, after only 3 weeks of doing it, I found that almost all of my sexual sensitivity was gone. I've seen many doctors and done endless research as I can't let myself quit. I've tried accepting it but I simply can't have any sort of healthy sex life if I don't find something as there is barely any sensitivity on my penis to generate an erection. FYI when I say pleasurable sensitivity, I mean the sexually pleasing sensitivity. I don't have any numbness where I can't feel my penis. Symptoms: -Spider veins in shaft that only show while erect. -White spots on glans (only show when flaccid) - Almost no pleasurable sensitivity on top or sides of shaft. Almost none on bottom until you get within an inch of the glans where it's about 30% what it used to be. - Glans are also 25-30% what they used to be except on right side where they're about 20%. glan and upper belly sensitivity go down to like 10% for a couple days if I masturbate then work their way back up (never used to happen, everything used to stay at 100%, I'd just be less horny.) -I have feeling in penis at all times, it has never gone completely numb but certainly has lost most of the sensitivity almost all of the pleasurable sensitivity in some areas. Just about every part of my body has more sensitivity than the bottom 3/4's of my shaft. - After injury, I masturbated every week or so to see if sexual feeling was getting better and a couple weeks in, I suddenly got a sharp pain on top left shaft very close to base while masturbating. It was while I was slightly pushing my erection downwards to make a 90 degree angle (which I had done a million times before). To relieve it, I had to pull erection to belly. After this happened twice, I quit masturbating for months. -If I do cobra pose to stretch abs/stomach, I get dull ache at top and sides of base of penis for awhile (didn't ever happen before injury). -I have 1 hard vein since injury. Not the largest main vein but probably equal to the 2nd largest. It's slightly buried under the skin and runs all the way from top center at base down to the top left base of glans. My guess is it's a dorsal artery.  After I quit masturbating like 2 months in, I think I made it like 3 months without it. Then after another week or 2, I stopped and probably made it like 6 months, then recently went 9 months and just started doing it again as my new Pelvic Floor therapist has instructed me to. She told me to keep everything in a comfortable position when doing it but after 9 months, anything that wants to heal would've and I should stimulate the nerves that are working. I've seen 3 urologists, all no help. They said they've never seen anything like it and let it heal itself. What I'd like to try and find out is if there's any tests or even new technologies anyone here might recommend I try. Stuff like Nerve growth factor or stem cells? Any tests that could actually locate or diagnose the problem. You know, tell me whether I have scar tissue, a partially torn ligament, compressed nerve, damaged nerve, etc. I'd like to pinpoint something because what if it is fixable? What if I could've been using some essential oil or vitamin this whole time to give a chance at healing? I can easily see a new urologist but if I do, I'd like to be prepared with a game plan on what tests I should get and why in case he's anything like the other 3 I've seen.  Also something I will mentioned real quick as a lot of people like to jump to this. This is not something that stays on my mind. This is not something that consumes me or has me depressed. I stay very busy with work and find happiness in many other ways so I can promise this issue is not mental or something that is caused by poor mental health/anxiety/depression.

I am looking for feedback on whether I should be concerned. So here goes: I am male and have been in a heterosexual monogamous relationship for several years. We are both completely healthy with no std history. In the last 6 months I have gone outside the relationship and have had isolated encounters with two women with unknown history, one in August 2017, the other, early January 2018. These were both protected vaginal intercourse encounters (condoms used). Early last month, I discovered a small, firm bump on my scrotum skin (like a small pea) which caused no pain but was slightly itchy (I do shave/manscape that area regularly). I became concerned and checked the web for some answers. I read that Apple cider vinegar applied to the area may turn colour on the case of HPV so I did so by dipping a Qtip in the vinegar then held on the area for a few minutes. The bump turned whitish, became inflamed then turned a dark red, probably burned due to the vinegar. A day later it grew to become a whitehead and I popped it in the shower (clearish coloured puss then blood). I became concerned over this and went to a clinic the next day for anonymous STI testing. They took a herpes swab of the sore (which was already scabbing) and did a full blood and urine test. The nurse told me she thought it looked like a cyst (but I've never had cysts before). As I was waiting for the results in early Feb I was also going through a bout of the flu (coughing, chills, muscle aches). I called two weeks ago and the results were negative - note 25 days had passed since the last sexual encounter and the test. They told me while results were negative they do NOT test for HPV/herpes in the blood - just the swab. A small comfort but I'm still concerned. I notice that since September 2017 (a month after the first encounter) that my tongue, throat cause random discomfort (tongue pain mainly - it feels like when you bite down on your tongue but milder - no sores or lumps). My family doc thinks that's indigestion/reflux. Also, when I stand up from sitting I feel a slight lightheadedness and notice my temples turn pinkish (no rash - just a flushness that quickly subsides).

Need natural alternatives.,"Hello, I'm writing regarding my mother's recent lab results. She has always had high cholesterol levels, but as time progresses her levels continue to increase. She has tried every cholesterol lowering medication on the market, aside from injections. We have had appointments with multiple cardiologists, but ultimately nothing changes. The last cardiologist did tests to rule out peripheral artery disease, because he suspected this was going on in her legs. The test came back negative, but he said that if she did not change things it would progress to that level. She is also a smoker and has had an extremely difficult time trying to stop. In addition to this she is not physical active, aside from walking around the house. She has severe back/ body pain and COPD just to add insult to injury. She also only eats one meal a day, by choice and usually the meal is unhealthy. The bottom line here is that she is in poor health due to her lifestyle, and the cholesterol meds have had adverse effects on her body. Her liver enzymes increased after taking Crestor to the point that she had to be taken off of the drug. I am trying to find something ""natural"" that will help her. I know fish oil has worked for people, I would like her to try that. At this point, I just don't know what dosage would do her good. I know she needs to stop smoking and become more active. I don't expect a miracle, but I would like to see the numbers lowered. She is only 57 years old, and living the lifestyle of someone who belongs in a nursing home. Just a few weeks ago she developed edema in her ankles and flank pain. Her doctor ordered labs, which is how I found out about the new levels. I assume this is all related to her heart and it worries me beyond anything I can put into words. I have spent years bringing her to doctors for her physical ailments, but this one is never resolved. I posted recent lab results below. Please, if anyone has had any success with fish oil or really ANYTHING to lower cholesterol, please reply. She has even fought me on taking fish oil, but recently said she would try it. I think she's finally understanding the long term effects of what she is doing. Trust me, I am well aware and have done everything I could. I wouldn't normally post something like this, but I'm desperate to help her and I'm pretty sure change needs to happen immediately.

I told her from day 1 she needs to find a solution, I'm here now and I'm sure you can fill in the rest. I found out recently that this is because of the pill. She won't go off of it because she says her periods are terrible: ""I don't think you understand how awful it is not being on the pill. Period symptoms are significantly worse, like I can't even get out of bed for the first 2 days because the cramps are so bad, you *** everywhere all the time, you're bloated when you eat but you eat *** everything. It's not something you will ever understand. "" She says that she initially started using the pill by doctors recommendation not because of its contraceptive qualities, but because her period was unpredictable. She said she would get blood in her pants sporadically any day of the month.  So my question is... Is there a win win out there? I.e. Something that continues to help her regulate her periods but doesn't eat her testosterone/kill her libido?

I currently can really only walk for 75 yards or so without having to stop and bend over to help reduce the pain and get my legs back under control.  Due to this problem and with the non availability of opioid pain medication I have been forced to take Advil and Tylenol at a rate of 6 Advil and 2 extra strengthen Tylenol daily for 3 years. last week I tore my right hamstring and reported to a walk in clinic to have my injury assessed. during my visit my blood pressure was taken and was told by the nurse it was extremely high and I need to get a primary Dr. and have the issue looked at.  When the Dr. came in he recommended to take more Advil and Tylenol than what i have been taking normally, I do not recount the exact dosage but it was 3 Advil 3 times per day with Tylenol between those dosages of Advil.  My question is with those dosages that the walk in Dr. told me to take be dangerous with my high blood pressure?.  As you can probably tell I do not have any medical insurance and do not want to schedule an un necessary appointment unless in fact there are other types of pain medication I can take that would not elevate my already high blood pressure. If it is a case of getting off the over the counter pain medication and be stuck with the pain then that is probably the only option I have, insurance is out of the question for my stenosis due to the fact of out of pocket cost and lack of coverage for back surgery even with an insurance plan other than some sort of Platinum plan that would destroy everything I have worked for over 40 years Home and retirement.

A few months ago, the problem came back with more tension and less nausea. This has already been quite uncomfortable, causing so much tension that my neck and back end up extremely sore and difficult to move. 8 days ago, I started to feel extremely dizzy and lightheaded at work. I got sent home and the problem got worse. I started monitoring my blood pressure and it is fluctuating every minute or so pretty rapidly.

My blood pressure was still all over the place, but they said they couldn't do anything unless it was a life threatening emergency and sent me home both times with a prescription for meclizine. The meclizine has not helped. The Urgent care doctor actually was able to have me almost pass out into her arms by having me sit down and stand up rapidly and recommended a CAT scan along with more monitoring how simple actions affect my blood pressure. They sent me to the ER that once again did nothing and did not even monitor my blood pressure on the second visit (Besides taking it once and seeing that it was 160/80) My primary care doctor was my last hope, but because of the fact that I was prescribed xanax over 6 years ago, he refuses to believe anything other than xanax withdrawal is the cause.I was also running a fever of 100.4 yesterday that ibuprofen took down and I have lost 6 pounds in the last week and a half despite eating normally.

My partner's doctor said that before an initial outbreak the virus can't be transmitted, this seems to align with anecdotes from married couples who did not infect each other after decades of sex... but would love to get specific confirmation of this.  2, I understand there is asymptomatic viral shedding - usually in the week before / after an outbreak. With viral shedding there are NO visible symptoms but the virus is shedding and so it can be transmitted just the same as when there are lesions. However... the implication from the statistics, descriptions and anecdotal evidence, is that when there is NO outbreak and NO viral shedding, then there the virus can NOT be transmitted... is that true?  The statistics say that there is a 10% transmission rate if you don't take medication and don't use condoms, simply avoid sex during an outbreak. With condoms and suppressants, it drops to 2-4%. That's very low. However, it seems to me that this is still referring to the days when a transmission is possible due to asymptomatic shedding. The implication would be that when there is no shedding, then there is also no transmission possibility.  Would love to get a firm answer on these 2 questions.  Thanks!  Felix",Genital Herpes

On April I started having heart palpitations randomly so I went to the ER, general doctor there asked for an ECG which come back normal so he prescribed me Xanax 0,5mg/ once a day for 5 days, after 10 days the palpitations stoped. Couple of weeks later they come back this time I also got Ill with zebra I think was a bad cold, I had fever of 38, headaches and mucus. I noticed it took me a long time recovering from that cold. When I got better 2 weeks after since I was still having palpitations I went to the cardiologist. He listened to my heart and told I had a heart murmur I/II degree, did a 24 hour Holter and found I was having tachycardia, and sinusal breathing arritmia. The Dr said it was nothing serious so prescribed nothing. Meanwhile I had lost 5kg in a month ( probably because of the cold). Had an investigation of what was causing the heart murmur so I did:  Thyroid eco: found several cistes on thyroid  Heart eco- all normal and functioning normal no alterations  Thyroid hormones tested- TSH, T3 and T4 all within normal range  Blood work- all normal  Nose and throat bacteria test- found a Kleibsiela bacteria on my throat (antibiotics prescribed for that) nose come back clear.  During that time I started experiencing sometimes pain on my left arm ( I thought I would have a heart attack) but it went away  I had electric shock like sensation down my right arm or shoulder sometimes but it would last miliseconds (that also stopped)  I experienced sometimes at night my temperature raising and a little bit of sweating (really minimal sometimes just between my breasts a bit)  I still have excessive hair loss and recently had to have my hair cut short (but I also been trying a new hair relaxer and dye it might be it.

I've had palpitations for years, by usually it's only a few per day. I've had my heart checked by echocardiogram, holter, blood tests, EKG, MRI.  Everything is always normal.  Well last night I had a small margarita and settled down to watch some tv before bed.  Then my heart started fluttering. It would feel like a flutter or strong beat. When I felt my pulse it almost seemed like it skipped a beat then would have a really strong beat.  This happened dozens of times per hour for at least 2 hours. I clocked it and I was getting a palpitation anywhere from every 2 seconds to every minute. Usually averaging about one every 10 seconds. Each palpitation only lasted a second or less.  I had no other symptoms: didn't feel pain or lightheaded. Pulse was slightly elevated for me (was around 80 bpm)  Eventually I thought it could be from dehydration so I drank 2 gatorades then that's when it began to dwindle and eventually stop.

It started out with the sudden appearance of two sort orange/pinkish aging spots on the head of my penis, which quickly grew into jagged lines that covered the front and sides of the head, but never reached the back for some reason. This was accompanied by random feelings of needle-pricking on the tip of my penis, and occasionally difficulty/a burning feeling when urinating. The needle-pricking sensation stopped not long after this, seemingly only being part of the start of the condition. The condition plagued there for awhile, until I noticed that skin around my urethra opening was peeling off, about a centimeter from the hole all the way around. Not long after that these horizontal jagged and grooves started appearing on my penis head, but they are very infrequent. Showing up at most twice a week. It platued there again until a few months ago, when the entire head would occasionally start burning and look red and irritated, which was sometimes accompanied by a sort of stabbing pain. It was also around this time that I started experiencing constipation, and the occasional pain when pooping. The only improvement is that the total red/burning system doesn’t happen anymore, and the only burning feeling is from the urethra when I pee. Also, there are actually some days where my penis looks completely normal, but these never last more than a day every couple weeks. Terrified but lacking insurance and funds, I have not seen a doctor for this at all. Can anyone give me a thoughts/suggestions? I’m very terrified that this is some sort of cancer.",Men's Issues

Sexual Health & STDs,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/41193/bv-and-yeast-infection,BV and Yeast Infection,"About 3 years ago I had a new sexual partner and noticed a weird discharge and irritation. I went to my Dr. and was treated for a yeast infection. After taking Diflucan I still had symptoms and called back. A different Dr. got me in that week and tested again. The lab results showed BV and Yeast. I was treated for both, and when finished with both medications I still had symptoms and my prescription was refilled. The Flagyl prescribed for the BV gave me a yeast infection and I had to take 3 Diflucan doses to get rid of everything. After the hassle of all of this I never went back to the Dr. to see if everything actually went away.  Around November this year I started noticing the same kind of discharge and was worried that the BV maybe just never went away from the 3 years prior. So, I called my OBGYN. She prescribed a total of 6 doses of Diflucan for a yeast infection that would not go away. A few weeks ago I saw a different Dr. from a different women's center. Turns out I have BV and a yeast infection. I was prescribed a cream for the yeast and Flagyl for the BV.  I am wondering how, after having 2 lab tests that checked for BV, it is showing up now? Could this have developed while being treated for the yeast infections? I also don't know why I have such a hard time getting rid of these two infections. I have had the same sexual partner for 3 years now. My last question is, should I wait to use the yeast infection cream until I have finished the Flagyl? Because I know that the Flagyl will give me a yeast infection.  I feel like my doctors get very frustrated because my issues keep coming back. I also worry that the medications didn't work every time I take them and I feel like I should be examined again, but I think that the doctors get frustrated that I keep coming back in for the same things.

Urgent","I’m 18 years old, I’m 6’ and weigh 145 pounds, and according to the nurse who took my blood pressure in the ER (more on that below), I have amazing blood pressure although I don’t remember what it was exactly.  I started smoking at 14, smoked about 5 rollies (half the amount of tobacco as normal cigs) on average for about 4 years. Senior year in high school, I started smoking weed although fairly lightly. While smoking, I would feel out of breath sometimes although whenever I took a break, I breathed just fine so I wasn’t too worried In April, I bought a vape and gave up smoking. My last cig was about 2 months ago and I don’t vape more than about 20 puffs a day. I still smoke “mini spiffs” every now and then which are mostly weed but also a tiny amount of tobacco (.2 grams or less). I’ve started going on two mile runs every other day which don’t exhaust me too much and I feel more or less in shape. Seems like I’m on a good track to a much healthier lifestyle, right?  For the past two weeks, I’ve been getting this tightness in my chest that, on top of being uncomfortable, keeps me from taking very deep breaths. It’s usually on the left side but sometimes it’s on the right side too. The pain will occasionally reside but it’s there most of the time. I also feel pain in my right shoulder, although i suspect it’s from an accident I had 2 months ago where I sprained my neck and deviated my septum pretty badly (my visit to ER). I also remember a few months ago, my heart felt like it skipped a beat. I’m worried it was a silent heart attack... I’m wondering if I have cause for concern (although I’m pretty sure I do) and if I need urgent medical care. Obviously, I plan on seeing a medical professional although my money situation is pretty bad at the moment which is why I’m on this forum.

Initially, the only thing that I could notice was an enlarged vein that circled my penis just below its head. This was only visible when I got an erection, but after a few more months the left side of my penis's foreskin had stretched to the point where there was so much extra skin, that when I would peel it back, there would still be foreskin on the left of the head of my penis, but not the right making it uneven. I now can also feel the vein below the head of my penis when it is flaccid. This has not caused me any severe pain, however I have noticed quite a bit of discomfort since this issue, as well as reduced sensitivity on the left side of my penis. I can almost describe the sensation as being numb, which is not exactly desirable... I think it is important to note that I am currently 17 years of age, and have been masturbating on a daily basis for several years. I am in the process of kicking this old habit for the sake of my own well being since I am obviously abusing the pleasure. This might sound strange, but when I was younger I would place my penis next to the pump inside a pool, which now that I think of it was certainly not a good idea. I am positive that some of the water being pushed out of the pump entered my penis, which sounds extremely cringeworthy now that I am reflecting on my actions :'D.

I’m 18 years old and always been a genuinely anxious person. I do worry a lot about my health and worry about symptoms a lot. I’m guilty for googling every symptom I feel and getting myself worked up about it. The main symptoms I get is heart palpitations, sometimes but not always, accompanied by chest pain. The sensation I get in my chest is frightening. It’s like a fierce flutter that happens randomly, I can be sat on the sofa watching telly, walking around, laying down and it also happens a lot when I bend over. I’ve been to the doctors 4/5 times explaining my symptoms. The first time I got told it was anxiety even though it can happen even when I’m at my most relaxed!? I’ve had 2 ECG’s which didn’t last long and both came back normal, just a faster resting rate than usual (90-105 beats per min usually). I just don’t get how this could determine a problem if I’m not getting the sensation while being monitored? Both times I wasn’t getting the palpitations and it frustrates me. Oh and my blood pressure is always fine. Every doctor I’ve seen always seems 100% sure that there is nothing wrong with my heart and I feel like no one listens to me. It’s going to take for me to go into cardiac arrest or something before someone pays attention. It really gets to me and affects my day to day life. Doctors say it’s anxiety that causes the symptoms, but I’m sure it’s the symptoms that cause my anxiety. If that makes sense.. does anyone have any advice? Is there a certain test I can ask for to be certain? I’m so scared of something bad happening to me and I HATE hospitals.",

Very painful urination, constant itch and burning sensation. I went to an urologist, gave a urine sample but doctor told me it’s most likely STD and we don’t have to wait for the urine sample results, he will just put me on 1g antibiotics and a shot and it should take care of it. Two days after the treatment my symptoms didn’t go away in-fact got worsen and I started to have white cloudy discharges. So I called the doctor and told them what’s going perhaps there should be a different treatment option based on my urine sample results.  And hold tight here, they told me “sorry we lost your urine sample so we need you to come in and give another sample” So I am pissed and frustrated, went there again, and that new sample came in negative while I had cloudy discharge, screaming pain when I urinate and itch and burning at all times. They told me because of the antibiotics I took the other day results probably came negative. So at that point they put me on 14 days doxycycline. that actually helped and my symptoms and pain, burning, discharge disappeared within a 4-5 days. I completed the doxycycline treatment. However burning pain went away, discharge etc went away, itching and constant needle rubbing like sizzling coming somewhere inside my urethra didn’t go away! i went back to doctor, same thing, urine sample negative but there is blood in there.  They put me back to doxycycline another 14 days, which didn’t do anything. Plus towards end of the treatment I started to feel fever and tenderness on my lymp nodes.  I called the doctor let them know about it. They told me I should get a full panel STD test, which I did right away and results came negative. And they told me to wait 3 months and if the itch feeling doesn’t go away I should contact them again. (Also I noticed something odd with the look of my penis that I didn’t have before all these happened. I noticed small white spots on the bottom middle of my penis, it’s a group of them round and almost looks like folling a line towards the tip on the head. Which later doctor told me they are pearly penile papules.)  A month after I decided to go to another urologist at that point. They took a urine sample, results came negative but they told me there is blood in my urine sample so doctor will further examine that. Doctor ordered abdominal CT Scan, blood test for kidney functions and a cystoscopy. Ct scan and blood test came good, cystoscopy; she said I had a minor structure before the globe. She told me to wait another 4 months and follow up, because cystoscopy sometimes treats the stricture. Itchy feeling disappeared after the procedure but came back a week after. It’s constant and never ending. I tried different diets, and eating habits, nothing makes it lessen or worsen.  So, 4 months after, around the time I am going to reschedule a follow up visit my health insurance changed with the new enrollment period and I couldn’t go to the same doctor because they wouldn’t accept my new insurance. I found another urologist covered under my new insurance.  I brought him all my medical records gave him a detailed scoop of the story.  Same thing over there with my urine sample, everything negative but there is blood in my urine.  First he put me on anti inflammatory pills for two weeks and scheduled me a visit right after that. Anti inflammatory pills didn’t do anything. So he scheduled another cystoscopy to see if the structure still exist or if there is anything else.  After the cystoscopy he said there is no stricture and everything looks okay.  At this point he thinks that my brain makes the itchy painful sensation and having blood in my urine may not always mean there is something wrong with me.  So he put me on antidepressant pills and told me to not to worry about it perhaps itching and pain will go away with time. So this is where I am now. I am not taking any antidepressants pills, I am refusing it to do so. I don’t think my brain is jacked up and if there is blood in my urine there is something these doctors are not taking the extra mile to look in to.  I am clueless and if I have to take those antidepressants I am going to take it because of my desperate situation.  Because it effects my daily life, gives me mood swings and I don’t feel any sex drive constantly thinking I still have something going on and I don’t want to infect anyone. Please share your thoughts, past experiences or comments, what next step I should take?  Is there other tests that I could take to get bottom of this?","Chlamydia , Men's Issues , Gonorrhea"

Right now it’s flat and it sometimes flare up. Not open or any discharge coming out. Just a bump within the skin and then it goes away. It’s always in the same spot. I thought herpes was different. It could be anywhere on the vagina and it’s open sores. At least that’s what I’ve seen from the pics. I’ve had one bump and it gets flat when it’s not flared up.

It's hard for me to translate the pain into words, but I'll try. It happens behind my sternum. It feels... sore and heavy? It's also kind of difficult to breathe when it happens. It lasts for several minutes. I also get rib pains (not always at the same time). It kind of feels like someone is tying a corset onto me or that my ribcage is shrinking.  I have a possible cause: I have lost weight in this past year. In August 2017, I was 123 pounds and started to diet. I lost 5 pounds by January. Another 5 by the end of January, and 10 since March. I'm not sure if that's considered ""rapid"" weight loss, but I know rapid weight loss can cause chest pain.  Other possibilities include stress or anxiety. My job has been rather stressful since March and on, and I do suffer from anxiety.  So I have two questions: 1. Is there a way to definitively determine the cause of the pain if I go to the doctor? Are there physical tests to find the cause? Or will it be a guessing game? 2. If it is due to weight loss, are there any irreversible consequences from the chest pains? This is probably impossible to answer with a diagnosis, sorry! Thank you for taking the time to read this!",

The vaginal sex lasted about 15 seconds before I wised up and opted for a condom, however this was after a couple minutes of oral sex that was unprotected (both ways).    Now, I’ve done my research and I know that what I’ve said is enough to contract an STD. In terms of symptoms, I’m generally quite an anxious person so I don’t know if a lot of it is in my head: 1) I have noticed that’s I’ve been urinating very frequently the last two days. However, I’m a very frequent urinator as it is (I have a very small bladder), so I’m not sure if I’m overthinking this. 2) I have not necessarily noticed burning every time whilst urinating, but on the third or fourth morning after I definitely did notice a burning sensation. However, this has happened before as a one off, and I don’t feel like I’ve had the same sensation since.    3) My penis does feel a little heavier than usual, but this one I can’t work out if it’s in my head. It almost feels (slightly) sore, maybe from the constant urinating.  That’s the extent of it. I know that I cannot accurately test for chlamydia and/or gonorrhoea for another week, so I guess the questions I had are: - is number 3 a common STD symptom? - whilst I know it is entirely possible that I contracted an STD, is it possible to have these symptoms and it be something else? Or does that sound too coincidental/wishful thinking? - exactly how frequent is frequent urination? When I go, I don’t seem to urinate large amounts, rather just small quantities. I actually noticed this perhaps more than usual about 10-12 hours following the sex.  Thank you.","Chlamydia , Gonorrhea"

And about a week after that I started having a burning feeling and cloudy urine when I peed so I ended up going to the doctor and they couldn't find anything but she prescribed me ciprofloxacin. When I took it my neck had gotten stiff and after 5 days I stopped taking it because my father said I was having an allergic reaction. Not long after that I got called back to the doctor on the 22nd and they diagnosed me with Chylmadia prescribed me a Z Pack gave me a gonorrhea shot and a flu shot all on the same day while also drawing some blood. While also Googling and before u say it yes ik now Google is evil as hell itself. But hiv came up and it said it may be because swollen lymph nodes so I started feeling around for them and on the right side of my ear I may have prodded it for a while once I found it. That was 3 days ago and now its swollen up but my hiv test came back today and everything was alright everything negative (thank God) although I'm not out the fire yet. But my question is could it be the antibiotics and the flu shot causing it, the prodding caused irritation? Or could it be hiv?","Chlamydia , Men's Issues , Gonorrhea"

Well I'm trying every which way to avoid it. I'm even scared to get a regular doc along with my OBGYN because I absolutely positively DO NOT want an annual. It scares me and freaks me out.

I am to wear 2 liters at night but it makes my nose bleed even with the water attachment. I just did a breathing study at the hospital and it came back normal, but my O2 meter reads that I can drop in the low 80s while sitting. I do have HBP. I am not sure what test I need to discuss with my doctor or why my O2 is dropping. I hope you can guide me so I can speak to my doctor."
