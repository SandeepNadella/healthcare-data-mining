We have talked, sexted etc. I have asked him many times on his health, to which he always answered that he was 100 percent disease free. When we met up, we had unprotected sex. No oral, no anal...just unprotected vaginal sex. He pulled out, and afterwards I texted him again asking about him being sure about being healthy. He responded again that he promised he was healthy. I was not on birth control, so the next morning I visited my doctor and received Plan B to be sure of no pregnancy. I scheduled an appointment for an IUD, pap smear and STI test.  My question is, am I possibly overreacting a bit when it comes to HIV? There is literally no reason to be nervous, but yet I am.

About 2 months ago I had protected anal sex with a man and I performed fellatio, which resulted in semen getting onto my face and a tiny bit on my lip. I washed all areas of contact a few minutes later with soap and warm water. Four days ago at noon, I developed a fever with a high of 38.8 C as well as a stuffed nose.  After taking some flu medication my fever went away overnight, however I developed a sore throat the next day as well as congestion with wet stools.  I woke up to find my clothes wet with night sweats. It was bearable however and so I only took a single flu pill in the morning. Yesterday I woke up to night sweats again and found it very hard to swallow, so I had a check-up done. The doctor recommended confinement in the hospital, but allowed me to be treated at home provided I did not develop a fever. I was told that I had a weakened immune system and that I had developed a viral and bacterial infection and was possibly at risk for dehydration, but other than my sore throat I felt fine. Today I woke up to find my clothes wet by night sweats again, but nothing else. Are these early signs of an HIV infection? And would I be recommended to get tested?",

I got everything that was going around that summer and my usual 125 weight went down to 87. The final ER discharge said, among other things, Acute chronic kidney failure, right. My numbers whack out from time to time, though BUN is always high. Sometimes so is creatinine serum and glomular filtration rate is low. My doctor says this isn't really evidence of kidney damage. I ask what it is evidence of, then. Recently, he learned that I had heat stroke at 5 (hospital for 6 weeks) and at 32 (hospital for a month [in the intervening years I think doctors learned that re-hydrating isn't enough; you have to reestablish electrolyte levels, too]) and so that means that of course I'm just dehydrating regularly and that's why the numbers go wonky. The ER doctor who diagnosed the kidney damage is the Director of Emergency Medicine at our medical complex. He is a very highly respected member of the medical community and he personally designed a new ER that is never overcrowded and employs only ER trained doctors; not just every doctor who comes along. He has not, in his career, been found to have made a single mistake. Yes, I have a tremendous amount of respect for this man. And my doctor says his diagnosis is wrong; I have no kidney damage. So why does my BUN always stay high, and why maybe twice a month, do the other two wonk out? Is it simply a sign that I'm not drinking enough?

Although the metal was dull, I hit it hard enough where it tore about an inch of top layer of skin off. There was some blood, but by no means gushing. It was very similar to being scratch by a cat, though a little but wider. I'm concerned someone may have also scratched themselves on it and I could potentially contract something they had. Or, since its in he inside of the porta-potty, I have no idea what's floating around airborne that may have been on it.

This not yet confirmed until goes to radiology I think she said, but I am almost certain I have them because of pain and my mother had them as well. The dr said theyre not very big, but was hesitant to give me any more information until confirmed results are in next Friday.  I am extrelemely worried to the point where I cant sleep, I am probably worrying my parents to death, and I'm finding it very difficult to wait till Friday for answers. I am a male, 24 years old, and I have a narrow urethra so I am scared to death that is going to be bad.  My questions are: 1. My doctor told my dad that they were ""minimal and able to use alpha blockers to dissolve them to dust"", but to be completely honest I feel like he is only making this up to make me feel better.  Is this even possible to dissolve kidney stones with alphablockers, or any other medication for that matter, to the point where you can pass them painlessly? 2. My second question/worry is that I have been opioid dependant and addicted to pain meds in the past, and have currently been on subxone for 3-4 years and am still taking it to this day, my tolerance is extremely high to opioids although my suboxone dose is now lower than thought possible, like .4mg a day, (I have tried to come off the suboxone several times but have not been able too because of pain I assumed was withdrawals, it makes me wonder if the pain that I attributed to suboxone withdrawal was really pain from the kidney stones this whole time, but I know nothing to prove this. ) What are the options for pain medications for this? Is there alternatives to opioids? I do believe I could control myself, especially with my mothers help, if I had to do opiates, but I really am hoping there is a better way to relieve severe pain.

HIV/AIDS,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/hiv-aids/33123/how-is-hiv-transmitted,How is HIV transmitted?,"You can get or transmit HIV only through specific activities. Most commonly, people get or transmit HIV through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use. Only certain body fluids—blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk—from a person who has HIV can transmit HIV. These fluids must come in contact with a mucous membrane or damaged tissue or be directly injected into the bloodstream (from a needle or syringe) for transmission to occur. Mucous membranes are found inside the rectum, vagina, penis, and mouth. In the United States, HIV is spread mainly by Having anal or vaginal sex with someone who has HIV without using a condom or taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV. For the HIV-negative partner, receptive anal sex (bottoming) is the highest-risk sexual behavior, but you can also get HIV from insertive anal sex (topping). Either partner can get HIV through vaginal sex, though it is less risky for getting HIV than receptive anal sex. Sharing needles or syringes, rinse water, or other equipment (works) used to prepare drugs for injection with someone who has HIV. HIV can live in a used needle up to 42 days depending on temperature and other factors. Less commonly, HIV may be spread From mother to child during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. Although the risk can be high if a mother is living with HIV and not taking medicine, recommendations to test all pregnant women for HIV and start HIV treatment immediately have lowered the number of babies who are born with HIV. By being stuck with an HIV-contaminated needle or other sharp object. This is a risk mainly for health care workers. In extremely rare cases, HIV has been transmitted by Oral sex—putting the mouth on the penis (fellatio), vagina (cunnilingus), or anus (rimming). In general, there’s little to no risk of getting HIV from oral sex. But transmission of HIV, though extremely rare, is theoretically possible if an HIV-positive man ejaculates in his partner’s mouth during oral sex. To learn more about how to lower your risk, see CDC’s Oral Sex and HIV Risk. Receiving blood transfusions, blood products, or organ/tissue transplants that are contaminated with HIV. This was more common in the early years of HIV, but now the risk is extremely small because of rigorous testing of the US blood supply and donated organs and tissues. Eating food that has been pre-chewed by an HIV-infected person. The contamination occurs when infected blood from a caregiver’s mouth mixes with food while chewing. The only known cases are among infants. Being bitten by a person with HIV. Each of the very small number of documented cases has involved severe trauma with extensive tissue damage and the presence of blood. There is no risk of transmission if the skin is not broken. Contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and HIV-infected blood or blood-contaminated body fluids. Deep, open-mouth kissing if both partners have sores or bleeding gums and blood from the HIV-positive partner gets into the bloodstream of the HIV-negative partner.

Some exposures to HIV carry a much higher risk of transmission than other exposures. For some exposures, while transmission is biologically possible, the risk is so low that it is not possible to put a precise number on it. But risks do add up over time. Even relatively small risks can add up over time and lead to a high lifetime risk of getting HIV. In other words, there may be a relatively small chance of acquiring HIV when engaging in a risk behavior with an infected partner only once; but, if repeated many times, the overall likelihood of becoming infected after repeated exposures is actually much higher.","Risk Factors , Living & Managing , Possible Exposure , Symptoms , Treatment , Diagnosis , Home Testing Kits"

I am concerned about possibly contracting hiv from this exposure. I had been masturbating a lot before then so I am worried about possible chaffing on my penis being present during the oral sex. I don't recall becoming seriously ill in the days or weeks falling this event. a few weeks after this event I had blood in my semen one time, and I have not had blood in my semen since. In late January of 2017 ( 4 months after the event) I went out and purchased an oraquick in home hiv test. I had to leave the test in my car for about an hour and a half before I got home. I put the test in a backpack and then put the backpack in my trunk. My thinking was that this placed seemed to be the coolest part of my car since the car is white and will reflect most sunlight. I did all of this because the test said to not store the test in temperatures above 80 degrees. I believe it was in the mid 60s that day. I came home and took the test and got a negative result, with a line at C and no line at T. I am worried that keeping the test in my car could have compromised the actual test. Since November of 2016 I have Noticed skin being flaky on two spots on both of my feet, it does not hurt or itch, and does not seem to be spreading, recently it seems to be getting better, but still present. I have had for a while what I think may be swollen lymph nodes under my jaw, they move and are not painful at all. About 3 weeks ago I felt very dizzy for about half a day and then a few days later I had a fever that peaked at 101 degrees, and only lasted about half a day. Two other people in my house also had a similar fever around the same time as I did so that is most likely where it came from. All in all, should I still worry? What should I do?",

PrEP can stop HIV from taking hold and spreading throughout your body. It is highly effective for preventing HIV if used as prescribed, but it is much less effective when not taken consistently. Daily PrEP reduces the risk of getting HIV from sex by more than 90%. Among people who inject drugs, it reduces the risk by more than 70%. Your risk of getting HIV from sex can be even lower if you combine PrEP with condoms and other prevention methods.","Risk Factors , Living & Managing , Possible Exposure , Symptoms , Treatment , Diagnosis , Home Testing Kits"

If you are living with HIV, it’s important to make choices that keep you healthy and protect others. Stay healthy. You should start medical care and begin HIV treatment as soon as you are diagnosed with HIV. Taking medicine to treat HIV, called antiretroviral therapy or ART, is recommended for all people with HIV. Taking medicine to treat HIV slows the progression of HIV and helps protect your immune system. The medicine can keep you healthy for many years and greatly reduces your chance of transmitting HIV to sex partners if taken the right way, every day.","Risk Factors , Living & Managing , Possible Exposure , Symptoms , Treatment , Diagnosis , Home Testing Kits"

According to the report, the estimated median time from HIV infection to diagnosis was three years in 2015. CDC previously estimated that, in 2011, the median time from HIV infection to diagnosis was three years and seven months. The seven-month improvement is a considerable decrease over a four-year period and reinforces other recent signs that the nation’s approach to HIV prevention is paying off. The Vital Signs analysis also found that the percent of people at increased risk for HIV who reported getting an HIV test the previous year has increased. Despite that progress, too few are tested. The Vital Signs analysis suggests that, without increased testing, many people living with undiagnosed HIV may not know they have HIV for many years.","Risk Factors , Living & Managing , Possible Exposure , Symptoms , Treatment , Diagnosis , Home Testing Kits"

I had friends with benefits, what have you. Half of the time it was protected, but other half it wasn't. Another thing that happened in my early 20s was.. I was raped by 3 or 4 guys in the same night. I went to a party with a 'friend' (I say this in 's because I thought he was a friend) and I got way too drunk, ended up having unprotected sex with said friend, but then his other buddies came into the room and took turns having their way with me even after I was saying no and that I didn't want to, they didn't care. Anyways, after taking contraceptives the next day, I literally moved on from that experience without a second thought. For the last 5, 6, 7 years however long ago it was, my sexcapades literally stopped. I never got tested.. but I've also had 0 symptoms and even to this day, I'm pretty healthy, still no symptoms at all. My current boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years, we've probably had unprotected sex about 10-15 times (we rarely see each other because of distance) and he as well has had 0 symptoms and it's been about 1.5 years since we've been having sex. Earlier this year, we had a discussion about HIV testing and up until that conversation, it never bothered me to get tested because I figured 'Well, if I did have HIV or something, something would have happened by now.' I've done a lot of research and I read that symptoms usually occur within the first couple weeks to a month after being infected (no symptoms for me or for him within this time frame), but then I also read that it can take 5-10 years before symptoms start happening.

HIV/AIDS,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/hiv-aids/33135/reduce-hiv-chances,Reduce HIV chances,"Many factors can decrease someone's chance of getting or transmitting HIV. Abstinence is the best way to prevent getting HIV from a sex partner. For people who are sexually active, there are more tools available today to prevent HIV than ever before. Choosing less risky sexual behaviors, taking medicines to prevent and treat HIV, or using condoms with lubricants are all highly effective ways to reduce the risk of getting or transmitting HIV. Additionally, men who are circumcised have a lower chance of getting HIV from having vaginal sex than men who are not circumcised. Reducing the number of partners you have can lower the chances that you will have a sex partner who will transmit HIV to you. There are different ways that partner communication and agreements you make with your partners can decrease your chances of getting or transmitting HIV. However, the accurate exchange of information about HIV status and sexual partners is critical for these strategies to work. Because your partner may not know their HIV status, or is unable to tell you this information, it is hard to ensure that these strategies will actually decrease your risk. In fact, these strategies may increase your risk.","Risk Factors , Living & Managing , Possible Exposure , Symptoms , Treatment , Diagnosis , Home Testing Kits"

Diabetes is a disease triggered when blood glucose levels rise above normal limits and its implications and complications are severe and need to be taken seriously.  These complications occur faster and more often in those who neglect their illness and which have long episodes of hyperglycemia in their disease. It is well to remember that glucose is not causing organ damage but the products of abnormal processes in which the glucose enters – processes which grow proportional to the level of blood sugar.  The severe complications of diabetes are:  1. Cardiovascular diseases – people with diabetes have a double risk of developing atherosclerosis, expressed by major cardiovascular events: myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death.  Diabetes accelerates the deposition of fats in large vessels and especially in the small ones, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The diabetic patient must regularly check his blood pressure, which must be maintained below 130/80 mmHg. Diabetes frequently registers blood fat abnormalities (dyslipidemia). These defects grow still further the risk of cardiovascular disease.  2. Eye disease – diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes in which consists in the illness of small vessels in the retina, the lining of the eye responsible for sight.  The appearance of retinopathy is signaled by a decrease in vision. This can go up to a total loss of vision – blindness. Therefore, in an annual eye exam, it is required.  3. Renal diseases  Diabetic Nephropathy means kidney failure due to diabetes. If it remains untreated in time, it leads to kidney failure when a significant portion of the kidney is destroyed. The final stage of the renal failure is uremia, in which the patient must do dialysis or kidney transplantation to survive.  Diabetic nephropathy has no symptoms, so it is necessary to detect it early with the help of annual albuminuria determination. The prevention of rapid progression of nephropathy requires a very good glycemic control.  4. The diabetic foot – it refers to all modifications due to diabetes at the feet levels. In advanced stages of diabetes, the gangrene is reached, and it is most often located in one or more fingers, but it can extend to the entire foot.  Diabetic arterial disease manifest itself at first by a sensation of cold feet, then as a feeling of “bite” at the pulp level which appears when moving and which it ceases at rest. Pain will occur more and more often and eventually even when resting.  When the blood vessels are clogged, some areas of the foot die and gangrene occurs. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy manifests through pain in the legs (more intense at night), numbness and tingling legs, feeling “restless legs”. The diabetic foot patient has to take care of this problem and to respect some rules: o	Washing the feet daily with soap and warm water; the dry needs to be made by dabbing, especially the area between the toes with a clean towel;  o	Nails will be cut straight, no corners;  o	The socks need to be changed daily – use cotton stockings in the summer over which wool socks can be put in winter;  o	Must wear comfortable shoes;  o	Any injury to the leg must be treated immediately and if necessary resort to a surgeon;  o	Extreme temperatures (heat-cold) must be avoided;  o	Heating pads are not to be used by people with diabetes;  o	Hot water bottles or ice packs at the level of the foot need to be avoided; o	Diabetic patients must not smoke because smoking decreases the blood flow in the legs;  o	The feet need to be examined daily using a mirror;  o	Tight socks must not be worn.  Emergencies in diabetes  	 1. Ketoacidosis occurs when there is not enough insulin in the blood, and the body begins to use fat instead of carbohydrates (sugar) for energy. The symptoms of ketoacidosis are nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, breath with the smell of acetone or “rotten apples”.  2. Hypoglycemia – marked by the decrease in blood glucose.   The symptoms of hypoglycemia are: sweating, tremors, fatigue, feeling cold, irritability, hunger, headache, visual disturbances.  These symptoms usually appear before meals or after a strenuous exercise. 	 Some complications can be kept under control and there are some things that can be done in order to decrease their complications but there are some cases – the emergencies – when the patient must see a doctor immediately.

Other option is surgery through kidney to gain access to the stone, which is what my Dr. recommends.

I wasn't quite sure where to put this, so kidney disorders it is! I am an eighteen-year old female. For last few months (perhaps four?), I've been experiencing some really weird symptoms and we're not quite sure why. Every couple of days, I have spells of sudden onset, extreme fatigue and exhaustion, accompanied with generalized weakness, some dizziness, a headache, and general malaise. The episodes do not seem to be triggered by anything specific and happen almost any time of day, though more often in the afternoons and evenings. They seem to be unrelated to my blood glucose, as I've taken readings during those times and they're normal. They also seem to be unrelated to the amount of sleep I get and my sleep patterns. I have no history of major illness, excluding polycystic ovary syndrome. The only medication I am on is hormonal birth control to control symptoms of PCOS. I have fairly recently had a number of blood tests done, and my TSH and CBC results came back normal. I also had a complete metabolic panel, and everything there was normal, with creatinine and BUN reading low. I have no history of anemia, except where readings are a little low immediately following a blood donation. I always recover within about a week or so, and don't experience any symptoms from that. (I have not had ferritin checked, and I perhaps should.) My eating habits vary a little, but I make sure I drink enough water throughout the day and always eat fresh fruits and vegetables, so I don't think my diet is contributing much, if at all.  This is all all a little worrisome, because I've never experienced anything before. It's a little scary to go from feeling entirely fine to being overcome with sudden exhaustion, weakness, and a headache in the matter of a few minutes. My doctor doesn't seem to see an issue, but I'm strongly considering seeing someone else. Any help is appreciated.",

It's a ""done deal""... That's a bunch of horse****!!!!! This was written a while back, here. A visitor scolding me for responding to her request for help (for her mom): ""...Have you encountered any prediabetes/diabetes person who doesn't express their wish to eat sweet snacks often?????...  I am asking for expert advice and knowledge!!!! Not this *** sort!!!!..."" My response to this is clear. Her mother is slowly, methodically realizing that Type 2 Diabetes can be ""reversed"" through preventative healthcare measures...eat real food, daily exercise, more rest, less drugs and far less sugar. A diet rich in processed foods and sugary drinks is behind the T2 Diabetes epidemic taking place, now... Please read the following articles: 1. ""Sugar-Sweetened Beverages: Over time, too much liquid sugar can lead to serious diseases"" ( ...Liquid sugar, such as in sodas, energy drinks and sports drinks, is the leading single source of added sugar in the American diet, representing 36% of the added sugar we consume...)      2.

It turns out that the long-term overconsumption of added sugars is linked to many of these dysfunctions...) Here's the bottomline: Until food manufacturers stop dumping sugar into their foods and beverages, there will be no end, in sight, of obesity, heart disease, cancer and Type 2 diabetes. The numbers stricken by these conditions will continue to soar. The key incentive for everyone who has Type 2 Diabetes is to ""show"" your children (and your children's children), that there's no freakin' ""genetic"" component to this disease, passed on from ""generation-to-generation"".

As I was receiving a massage prone, the sex worker was rubbing her vagina against my lower back(away from the pimple; she promised to avoid it) and smearing the fluids and oil with her hands. Later, I turned on my back and exposed the pimple to the towel and, perhaps, bed. There was no penetration. My fears are: (1)that the blood from the pimple might have run down my back and come in contact with her vaginal fluids, (2)that I might have exposed the pimple to the parts of the towel soaked with her vaginal fluids, and (3)the fact I noticed a rash on her neck. Soon, I started experiencing symptoms. Days 1-8: general itch, headache, throbbing in the ears. Days 8-25: fever(max 100F); frequent watery diarrhea; faint runny nose, sore throat, and dry cough; faint rash on trunk. Diarrhea(somewhat manageable with solid, dry food) and sore throat(worsened) persist. I've done a blood test for several parameters on day 22: CMV - negative, EBV - negative, QFever - negative, CRP - normal. I'll do a combo test on day 28.

The fluid belonged to this individual. I took a sniff of this fluid which almost choked me. I've become worried that this fluid was a bodily fluid, and because of the person's drug usage that he could have Hiv. Please can you advise if smelling a bodily fluid of any type could cause an individual to catch hiv?? My nose was about an inch from the bottle and No fluid enter the nostril, just the air and the extremely pungent smell. It's possible that the fluid was ammonia used for his drug preparation, that's what he intimated but I cannot confirm this and hence my worry. Aside from the above question, are you able to answer the following in as much detail as your professional knowledge allows? 1) if an hiv infected individual was to deposit there infected blood/urine or other bodily fluid straight into an empty bottle and it be screw capped closed, would the virus survive and still be transmittable? Would this act like a syringe barrel and be air tight? 2) using the above scenario, if someone were to then open the bottle and sniff/smell/inhale the contents, are they at risk of infection.

After showering prior to the session I managed to pop a pimple I had on my back with a towel. First, I lay on my stomach upon a towel-covered bed. As the sex worker prepared to apply the oil, she noticed I was bleeding from my back and announced that she was going to apply oil around that area and skip it. At a certain point she began rubbing her genitalia against my lower back(away from the pimple), after which I flipped on my back, at which point she proceeded to give me a handjob. I tried to stay on the towels that covered the bed, and I hope I managed. However, my primary fears are (1)that, while occasionally fidgeting, I might have somehow rubbed my pimple against that part of the towel which had come in contact with the part of my skin that had been exposed to her genitalia, and (2)the fact I noticed a rash of some sort on her neck(only, though I didn't look at her back).  That was 11 days ago. The very next day I started experiencing a general itch around most of the body. The following days(beginning from perhaps as soon as the second day)saw the onset of a headache and dull thuds in my ears. Perhaps there was also a scarcely noticeable increase in body temperature during this period to around 37C(98.6F), but I'm not so sure. On day 6, my doctor diagnosed it as a common virus(something he called ""Simby""). By day 7 or 8 the symptoms seemed to be receding. However, later on during day 8 there began a worsening in the symptoms. That night saw an increase in temperature to above 37.5C(99.5F). By that time pressure in the ears has build up somewhat and a very low-intensity sneezing, running of the nose, and inflammation of the throat became just barely noticeable. Heartburn and nausea also began at around the 8th day. On the morning of 10th day I measured a normal body temperature, but during the day it went up again to slightly lower than 37.5C(99.5F). That day I also noticed a recurring pressure in the stomach area and where the liver is. I saw the doctor again that day and told him about a sexual encounter I was concerned about(without going into details), he realized I feared HIV and reassured me that it is most probably only a flu. Just to be on the safe side, he referred me to a general blood test. Finally, day 11 saw the onset of frequent watery diarrhea and pressure in the upper stomach area, right side. Temperature is 37.2C(98.96F). Whether or not I've noticed a rash, I honestly cannot tell(there are several suspicious, extremely faint blotches on my back and chest, but these are areas where I've always had pimples, plus this is mosquito season). The doctor said it was a rash. This is definitely no ordinary flew or stomach issue.  In light of this description, can my symptoms indicate HIV, and, also, what other illness with similar symptoms could I have caught there? I fear there was some sort of contact between my blood and areas that had come in contact with her genitals. Moreover, there was oil all around, which I fear might have served as a conduit. What can be transmitted that way with a similar confluence of symptoms except HIV? Any help will be appreciated.",

Over the period of the next few weeks I got more swelling with some side pain. For 3-4 weeks I was going from Dr. to Dr. focusing on my leg swelling which nobody seemed to be able to figure out.  After x-rays, multiple blood tests, etc. etc. cancer was seemingly ruled out. I took a break from one week with continual leg swelling and some back pain which I falsely attributed to exercise and yoga. I did notice very frequent urination during this time.  I eventually went back to the Dr and I suggested a urine test because my original blood work had a high white blood count. Well, long story short, it seems that I might have had a low grade bladder infection for a year that eventually went into my kidneys causing edema of my right leg. I finished my course of antibiotics but because of the very late diagnosis which for the most part I arrived at on my own I fear I have now permanently damaged my kidneys. For 4 weeks I was walking around with an undiagnosed kidney infection. Now I have Proteinuria (foamy urine). My Creatinine levels were very high but still barely in range. My EGFR was above 60 which indicates relatively good filtration ability.  My question is, is the proteinuria common for a period of time after a pretty bad UTI and kidney infection? Does it go away? I am done with my antibiotics. Should I get more prescribed. I feel the majority of the symptoms have subsided with some minor swelling in my legs still. I frequently urinate with a lot of foam.

Most health care workers that work in hospitals in my area work twelve hour shifts five to six days in a row, sometimes seven days a week when there is an employee shortage. These long hours without a break in between shifts can lead to employee burnout. The paid fire service in my area has for the most part adopted a 2-3-2 scheduling system. This may help healthcare supervisor’s better schedule employees. Another aspect that may assist supervisors with scheduling is to utilize a computer based scheduling system. 2-3-2 System 	The 2-3-2 system works on a fourteen day cycle. In this cycle, employees work two 12 hour shifts, then are off for two days, then they work three 12 hour shifts, then are off for two days, then they work two more 12 hour shifts, and then are off for three days. This may benefit the healthcare supervisors when they are working out a schedule because they can assign employees in teams. For example “Team A” will work two 12 hour day shifts, and “Team B” will work two 12 hours night shifts and so on until the end of the 2-3-2 14 day cycle. Also, “Team C and Team D” can be implemented as well to follow this same cycle to ensure that there is no shortage of employees. At the end of their three D off period, the employees that worked the day shifts, will be rotated to night shifts and vice versa to keep things fair and consistent. Computer Based Employee Work Scheduling  	Another difficulty that faces healthcare supervisors is to ensure adequate employee staffing. The 2-3-2 schedule creates the work rotation, however the question lies as to how to have enough coverage. With the computerized scheduling system, the employees enter their availability into a database that gets forwarded to the supervisor. The employees can also request time off in this system as well. This will assist the supervisor in creating the teams for the 2-3-2 work schedule as well as filling in any gaps when an employee is absent. Using this computerized system, instead of relying on paper and pen schedules, or making phone calls to see who can fill a shift or forcing someone to stay for an extra shift, the supervisor can make these determination at a glance. The supervisor is no longer frustrated with having to make phone calls to try to find someone last minute, and employees are not frustrated by being forced to work extra shifts or being short staffed. This software will make it easier to spread out any overtime or extra shifts due to employees being absent as well. There are paid fire departments and ambulance corps in my area that utilize scheduling software such as When to Work. With this software employees enter their availability up to a month ahead of time which allows the supervisors enough time to create a schedule and fill in any gaps.  Concluding Thoughts 	The 2-3-2 schedule system and the computerized scheduling will create fairness for the employees and will also make it easier on the part of the supervisor. The 2-3-2 system will allow employees to have a three day weekend of break every 14 days, which would allow the employee time to become adjusted to their new incoming 12 hour rotation. This system also allows for employees to be scheduled in teams and to make it easier to assign overtime when employees are absent. The computerized work scheduling systems also make it easier for the employees and supervisor. The employees enter their availability and schedule any possible absences. This allows the supervisor to create adequately staffed teams and find replacement employees quickly and efficiently when an employee is not at work.  Article Citation",

I had kept it at bay for several years and then recently met someone that I fell in love with only to find out they were in love with someone else. Wow did it return with a vengeance. To me the worst part is that you are alone no matter where you go and no matter what you do. If you are alone, you are tortured by your own thoughts. If you are not, you want desperately for those who may care for you to say or do anything to fix it....as if you cannot breathe. They want desperately to help but don't have access to the air to keep you from suffocating.  Depression is like an old enemy who has found their way back with new and more pointed weapons. Not only is the pain as acute as ever but now my age has me convinced that there is not a way I will ever be happy in this life; that I am doomed to be a spectator to something I have not somehow earned or deserve.","Depression , Bipolar Disorder"

Now, three months into the year, I'm borderline agoraphobic, scared to even go to the grocery store because my panic attacks have been out of control as of late.  I've been reading Barry McDonagh's ""DARE,"" where it tells you to essentially invite the anxiety to happen, which is great, but when your anxiety causes you to become unbalanced (""loss of equilibrium""), it's hard to focus when you're working in a fast paced environment where you have to stand, surrounded by people, and you look like a freak because you're grasping for any surrounding platforms to balance yourself on. Someone I work with even said to a co-worker of mine that it seems like I have a ""drug"" behavior going on, which hurt immensely. The only drug I take is Lorazepam (0.5 mg), to ward off the panic attacks in public, especially when I can't get away to control them. My question is - does anyone else experience that awful sensation of being off balance or being dizzy when they're anxious? How do you control it? How do you cope with it when it's happening?

I don't know why. Some are neighbors. Every where I go they are there as well. I'm followed on the streets when driving. Large groups of cars driving in well coordinated patterns. I cant escape from them. I go to stores, the hospital or the airport and they are there. I have made notes of their lic plates, cars and drivers and they always match. They have gotten into my phone, my car, computer and even took control of my modem keeping me offline. The all seem to have the same black cell phone and press a button whenever they pass by. They have been able to disable and even damage my cell phones so they no longer work. They can scramble my gps and keep me driving in circles. They seem to have the ability to transmit voice from fans, my a/c and microwave oven. They never make eye contact always looking the other way. They are both young and old including some children.

I respect my doctors and other medical professionals immensely, but I am genuinely desperate. In October (about 5 months ago) I visited my PCP after feeling sickly for weeks on end. I had been having low-grade fevers on a daily basis, joint pain and general aches, and fatigue so bad I would sleep for 16 hours. My blood work came back with normal CBC, but positive for mono. I was given prednisone (which did nothing) and told I would feel better in a week or two. 5 months later, my symptoms have only gotten worse. With my fevers come a bright red butterfly shaped rash across my face, and I am often too sick to get out of bed. I visited the doctor once again, who agreed that the fevers were not likely caused by the mono I had five months ago. She thought there was a chance of an autoimmune condition, so tested my ANA, CRP, CBC, ESR, and for lyme (for good measure). Yet, every single test came back within the normal range. I had been treated for kidney pain recently as well, but all that showed up in my urine was a little protein and white blood cells (but not an amount too excessive). With having tested negative for lupus, lyme, and any sort of infection, I do not know what to think. My fevers have not subsided, and the rash on my face shows up a few times a week at least (it's not itchy, just hot). I also continuously break out in hives, despite having had allergy testing (not sure if this is related). If I don't have an autoimmune condition, lyme, mono, or any infection, why on earth am I feeling so sick and what can I do to feel better? I feel like I have tried everything, and I eat and exercise well. Even pain meds do a poor job of relieving my symptoms.

For the past 3 years I have been dealing with joint pains (fingers, hands, wrists, hips, knees, ankles, and elbows). Every morning I wake up feeling like I was hit by a bus. After about an hour or so, I am able to move around and my joints feel bruised. It is symmetrical. For example, both left and right pointer fingers hurt worse than all other fingers throughout the day. I have clear cognitive dysfunction. I forget what I am talking about mid sentence. I will forget what others tell me. I sometimes find myself in a stall mode where I am just staring at my computer screen at work. Its like my brain is refusing to work for me. I use and sometimes type the wrong words. So instead of saying “I drove the car” I would say/type “I used the bike”. These mix ups are so confusing, people around me think I am losing my ever loving mind. Concentration is becoming a huge issue as well. My overall body is achy and feels like a dull pain is covering my entire body. Fatigue is a huge issue as well. I describe it as a powering down of my systems. One minute I will be fine and then I will go through 5 days or so of intense fatigue. I also have sharp stabbing pains going through my left arm and hand throughout the day. It’s so painful that it keeps me up at night and will affect my concentration. My hands go numb when holding my phone or talking on the phone and at night when I sleep. About two years ago I started getting these debilitating back pains. I kept ignoring them until I finally went to the ER and found that I needed an emergency gallbladder removal. I thought everything would be better after that, but the back pains still persist. These pains have the intensity of a contraction. It sounds similar to pancreatitis pains, my my blood tests don’t show any issues with my liver or pancreas. I also have a red rash that showed a little over a year ago. I have just gotten pregnant and assumed it was related to hormones/acne . It is still here and looks similar to a Malar Rash. When the color is more defined I know I am about to get extreme fatigued followed by the back pain and intensification of the above mentioned symptoms. I also get mouth ulcers about 2-3 times a month.  As for blood work, I have a positive ANA with a titer of 1:1280. I have speckled pattern. I have a positive Anti-SSA (149 strong positive). I have a positive RH Factor (54). I also have an equivocal saccharomyces cerevisiar AB (IGA) at 21.2.  During the appointment I had Friday, my Rheumy looked at my hands and said the fingers didn’t bend correctly. He asked if I could open jars and I let him know opening jars, taking my charger out of my phone in the morning is impossible and opening water bottles is impossible in the mornings as well. He proceeded to tell me he thinks I have osteoarthritis even though I am 40 and young for that diagnosis. He asked if my mother had issues opening jars and when I confirmed she did, he said it’s genetics and not Rheumatoid Arthritis. I later saw a table with the differences between the two and found that my symptoms more fit with RA. It is symmetrical pain, it came on suddenly, I have a high ANA and a positive RH factor, etc. He then pushed a couple muscles and when I flinched he said my muscle pain is from not getting enough sleep and possible fibromyalgia, but that he couldn’t help me with that. He then went over all my blood work and said the only thing he sees is that I might be at risk for Sjogren’s. I did ask about SLE, he said if I had SLE then I would have 4 out of the criteria list he gave me. He said the Malar Rash (picture posted) has to be diagnosed by a dermatologist. I don’t have arthritis (which I thought he just said I did and I clearly have all symptoms pointing to it). He agreed with mouth ulcers and positive high titer ANA so I only had two.  He ended the appointment saying there was nothing he could do for me. I don’t have dry mouth or dry eyes so he can’t make a Sjogren’s diagnosis. He told me to go get a second opinion. I have been shocked since Friday. I clearly have something going on so I am baffled why he is done searching for answers. My first appointment I was five minutes late and he seemed annoyed by me. I overheard him dictating my patient record and he said that he didn’t think I had any issues and that the blood work would most likely reveal nothing. I called him after that appointment and asked him why he felt that my blood work we just sent in wouldn’t show anything. He explained to me that he has been doing this for years and he just knew. He was apparently wrong.  Am I going crazy here, or is this doctor blowing me off? I feel like all my symptoms point to some sort of autoimmune issue.

Couple of weeks later they come back this time I also got Ill with zebra I think was a bad cold, I had fever of 38, headaches and mucus. I noticed it took me a long time recovering from that cold. When I got better 2 weeks after since I was still having palpitations I went to the cardiologist. He listened to my heart and told I had a heart murmur I/II degree, did a 24 hour Holter and found I was having tachycardia, and sinusal breathing arritmia. The Dr said it was nothing serious so prescribed nothing. Meanwhile I had lost 5kg in a month ( probably because of the cold). Had an investigation of what was causing the heart murmur so I did:  Thyroid eco: found several cistes on thyroid  Heart eco- all normal and functioning normal no alterations  Thyroid hormones tested- TSH, T3 and T4 all within normal range  Blood work- all normal  Nose and throat bacteria test- found a Kleibsiela bacteria on my throat (antibiotics prescribed for that) nose come back clear.  During that time I started experiencing sometimes pain on my left arm ( I thought I would have a heart attack) but it went away  I had electric shock like sensation down my right arm or shoulder sometimes but it would last miliseconds (that also stopped)  I experienced sometimes at night my temperature raising and a little bit of sweating (really minimal sometimes just between my breasts a bit)  I still have excessive hair loss and recently had to have my hair cut short (but I also been trying a new hair relaxer and dye it might be it. I just never had so much hair loss before)  I noticed jerk like movements when I'm about to fall asleep at the first it happen 3 times now I have muscle spasms constantly they are very small and last miliseconds too  My heart had no reason to be having arritmia so I was sent to the endocrinologist.  Showed all my lad work and was sent to have anti- thyroid anti-corps tested.  It takes two weeks for me to get the results so I have to wait.  Since this first started I have eye discomfort but for the past 3 days I sometimes had something ""flow"" on my peripheral vision but bothers me. It's like I can catch any movement or light and it is just a weird perception and I see even small particles floating on the air.  Summing up my symptoms are:  1- heart murmur I-II and palpitations ( tachycardia and sinus breathing arritmia)  2- hair loss (brittle very thin hair)  3- eye discomfort and weird vision  4- neck stiffness and neck pain  5- neck lymph nodes enlarged and thyroid nodules  6- weight loss and apetite loss 7- increase on bowel movements  8- menstrual cycle alterations  9- jerky involuntary movements and muscle spasms  If anybody has any idea what this can be or what other tests I should do please help me out.

Went to the doctor and was prescribed augmentin, which resolved both the fever and the sore throat in ~24 hours or so. Concerned about HIV, I took an at home OraQuick Oral Swab test at 7 weeks (49 days exactly) and then again at 11 weeks (77 days exactly). Both were negative. I thought the 11 week test was being done at 12 weeks in the hopes of being conclusive but realized after the fact that I had miscounted by a week. It has now been about 6 months since the encounter. I am only concerned because I continue to have what appears to be geographic tongue - lesions on the tongue with white borders that come, then heal completely for 2-3 weeks, and then come back in different places. They aren't painful, but do look pretty weird. Both my PCP and Dentist have diagnosed them as geographic tongue, which I know is a benign condition of unknown origin. What is weirding me out is that the appearance of geographic tongue aligns almost exactly with the oral sex exposure. So my questions are: 1. If the sore throat was ARS, is it possible that it would have manifested so soon after exposure?  2. If the sore throat was ARS, would the antibiotics have worked like they did? 3. How confident should I be in the two tests I performed? I know I did not take them at the correct timeframe to be conclusive, but am a bit confused as to whether or not they have any validity at all given the times at which I performed them? It has been a bit confusing trying to determine when antibodies are present in saliva vs. blood. Do I need to test again? 4. Is there any correlation between the geographic tongue lesions and HIV? I have read that there is no connection but the timing is so strange.","Possible Exposure , Symptoms , Home Testing Kits"

At that time, the table surface seemed dry and I did not see any wetness. I am worried though because few times, we received specimen from HIV positive people. I mean can HIV stay viable enough in the surface and could have penetrated through the sandwich wrapper and become a risk for me of transmission when I ate the sandwich?

I've also been having a chronic croupey cough that lasted for 3 months before my parents took me to an immunologist to check for asthma and allergies. All the allergy tests came back negative and my lung function test was 50%. The doctor gave me an inhaler and put me on a month long course of prednisone for possible asthma. Even though the prednisone messed with my blood sugar, it helped a lot with my other symptoms. I felt like I had a lot more energy, my rashes slowly started to clear, and the swelling and pain in my joints went down. After the course ended and I was tapered off, I slowly started to feel worse again. My family all thinks I'm just being a hypochondriac and that I'm being paranoid, especially since being diagnosed with diabetes, since my blood tests all seem to come back normal except for an elevated sedimentation rate, high white blood cell count, and vitamin deficiencies.

Then during Thanksgiving weekend, she had sudden onset of pain in both knees. The pain is severe enough that she can not use the stairs, can not walk for any prolonged period of time, nor stand in one place for long without pain. We revisited the orthopedic who ran bloodwork and sent her for an MRI. The labwork came back showing low WBC and low absolute neutrophils but the RA was under 14 (normal), C reactive protein was under .2 (normal), Sed rate 2 (normal), and HLA -B27 Antigen was negative. She then referred us to the rheumatologist but we can't get in until February. In the meantime, she began having severe chest pains and shortness of breath. Off to the ER where they diagnosed inflammation of the chest wall and sent her home (no meds). We have no idea what the MRI shows as ortho had it sent directly to the rheumy and again they can't see us for a few months. What is going on?!

Two years ago I had my first son, before his birth I was very healthy. After his birth I developed weird symptoms, skin rashes, dizziness, weakness, joint pain, headaches, low grade fevers, floaters in eyes, dry mouth and eyes, light sensitivity especially in eyes, stomach problems etc. It started with the skin rashes and I went to a derm, they said it could be scabies and gave me multiple rounds of the treatment for that(feel like the cream could have triggered an immune response), still was getting rashes and was on prednisone for awhile. The rashes would come and go. I had my second son 1 month ago and during the pregnancy the joint pain, bad headaches and neck pain, swelling and rashes continued. Had a few incidents of numbness in my hands and feet during the pregnancy. Developed bad sinus problems too. Was getting sinus infections every other month. My OB pretty much blew me off the whole time and said it's pregnancy and go deal with it. The joint and muscle pain was so bad I could barely walk in the mornings and my headaches and brain fog continued to worsen. Since November I've also come down with 3 bad colds and feel like my immune system is non existent. Even when I'm not sick I have chronic sinus problems. Today I just got back from the dr and have a swollen pus filled tonsil, fever, and swollen neck glands. What could be wrong with me? Could my first pregnancy have triggered an autoimmune disease? Could the rashes be Lyme? Or could this be something completely different? Plan on seeing a regular dr this week and getting blood work or a referral.

I was also reading a book that Sulfa can cause a flare in Lupus patients.  In Dec 2016 I had a UTI and my primary physician gave me sulfamethoxazole..... a certain antibiotic. This was what it said on the Lupus site  ""Bactrim and Septra are often prescribed for bacterial infections, especially urinary tract infections. They are also sometimes given prophylactically (i.e., to prevent infection), especially in people taking immunosuppressive medications. However, it is very important that you avoid Bactrim and Septra, because these antibiotics are known to cause an increase in sun sensitivity and lower blood counts in people with lupus, resulting in lupus flares.""

Starting at age 17 I began having Migraines with Auras which continue. I had a complete hysterectomy at 30 and developed Bells Palsy at 38. I was diagnosed with Lupus at the age of 43. I began taking low levels of Plaquenil and remarkably it reduced the symptoms & I returned to work after a 2-year layoff. I modified my diet, stress levels and workload and except for flu and sinus infections (which usually lasted 10x longer) I survived with the love and attention of my family and coworkers who constantly reminded me to take care of myself. I developed severe chemical allergies to the point that I had to retire because of the perfume and chemicals in our office. Throughout all of this the only symptoms that I consistently displayed in medical tests were low white blood cell counts (25 - 35). At age 65 I began having problems with my right eye (the right side of my face was the one damaged by the Bells Palsy) but over a three-year period my ophthalmologist indicated that it was the optic nerve which was inflamed and it would go away. I should have sought a second option. This year at age 68 I lost vision in my right eye and it has been diagnosed as Non-Arteritic Anterior Isochemic Optic Neuropathy (the optic nerve is permanently damaged). Doctors assure me this was not caused by the Plaquenil; however, realizing there is a slight chance of damage from the drug, I have stopped taking it as I certainly can't afford to lose sight in my left eye. I am posting this because I believe my own experience with Lupus has shown me that the disease causes significantly more damage to my system than is obvious and that it shows up in non-standard ways, probably long before it is diagnosed. I think that because Lupus is usually not outwardly visible, we and our doctors fail to understand its possible detrimental effects on other illnesses or diseases. As Lupus patients we need to watch all symptoms and illnesses and assume the worst. That way we delve deeper, question more, and take charge of ourselves. If we're not satisfied with what our caregiver is saying we need to seek other opinions. We must advocate and make sure everyone around us understands the significance of the disease and its possible deadly consequences. That includes our family, colleagues and medical team.",

Half of that time, he’s been on medication for depression. It’s been hard, but our love has also been strengthened through many trials and difficult times that we’ve made through. In connection with his depression is what seems like a whirlwind in his employment. He was a teacher, but found the work unfulfilling (as a current teacher, I totally understand that the high demands dictate the need for a love of the profession in spite of those demands and low pay). He wishes to find joy in his work, but unfortunately he has been passed for several positions and it has worn on him. I now find that my happiness is being impacted dramatically by his. I worry about that. I have always been able to see the forest for the trees, have had a positive attitude, can think through things rationally. But now I find that I come home, feed the dogs, and find whatever I can for dinner, then go to bed. Being stressed about work is bad enough, but also trying to be strong for him all the time is wearing on me. I don’t want to say that but it’s true. I wish to be supportive of him but I also know how important it is to take care of myself, and I feel guilty about it. I know I shouldn't. But I do. I worry that I now have depression because he does. I don’t want to resent him for that, and I fear that I will. To make matters worse, the one year anniversary of his mother’s death is coming up and he was just rejected again today for a position that would’ve been perfect for him and for us. I find myself gearing up for what I know will be a time he needs me to be supportive, but part of me doesn’t feel like I have it in me to do it. And the guilt comes back. I guess I’m not really looking for any advice, I just don’t have anybody to talk to about it. Thanks for reading.",Depression

Earlier this summer, after unexpected sun exposure, I had a red rash that followed the curve of my left cheekbone. (It did not have this on the right). It was extremely itchy at times and lasted for nearly a month. I actually thought I had skin cancer and made an appt with a dermatologist, but then the rash suddenly disappeared.  I was exposed to sun again. A week after the rash disappeared, my left knee became so painful that I couldn't walk for three days. X-rays did not show evidence arthritis and the MRI showed no tears. This went away for about a month. Then I was exposed to sunlight again, and I ended up having terrible joint pain on both knees this time.  Now my kidneys show ""decreased functioning,"" and I have to sleep at least 9 hours a day to be functional (to be fair, though, I've always needed a lot of sleep). I lost a job because of this; I used to work 60-70 hours a week, and when I could no longer perform at that level (this was during the period of my joint pain + excessive sleeping), my boss fired me immediately. My nurse practitioner (the rheumatology office was too busy to let me see a doctor, so they had me see their nurse practitioner instead) said that the rash was probably just an allergy because the butterfly rash appears on both side.

I ALWAYS find something to do like sleep, watch videos, listen to music etc so that I have something to feel and react to and not have any time spare time to get into my thoughts because I loathe the negative thoughts that never seem to leave. I'm actually a teensy bit bubbly & quite smiley if need be (but thats just me I guess). There are things that make me laugh, cry, want to chuck my phone across the room & feel happy, giddy, sad, angry etc but most of it is online stories and videos. I always have an automatic smile when I say hi or talk to someone and sometimes it feels genuine. Even if I feel hopeless, like I'm wasting my life and get real apathetic about school work, I still try to get good grades. I'm confused if all this is just my personality and me overthinking or if it's something more.",Depression

After reading up on this condition in online medical journals, it seems to be the only thing that makes sense. The only unlikelihood of this is that it typically affects women over 50. I started taking Wellbutrin XR about 3 and a half months ago and started experiencing on and off low-grade fevers, fatigue, terrible joint and muscle pain, along with swollen lymph nodes a couple times. I usually only get sick about 3-4 times a year and I started getting ""sick"" every two weeks, then every week, then almost every day. I have never experienced this in my life so I went to get blood tests done and everything came back completely normal and I was told I didn't have any cold or flu. The doctor was puzzled and could not come up with any possibilities of a diagnosis. I suspected I was having a bad reaction to the Wellbutrin so my psychiatrist has put me on a taper plan to get off this medication (I have 4 days left). This morning I woke up in tears because the joints and muscles in my arms and hands were hurting so bad they felt like they were on fire. I am hoping these symptoms will subside after discontinuing the medication. Unless my symptoms become worse and do not away, I don't think there will be any point in going back to the doctor. Has anyone else experienced this from a medication? I know there are four medications that have been proven to cause this and there are at least 50 more medications that have been reported to cause it (Wellbutrin being one of them) but not actually proven. Luckily, if I do have this condition it is said to completely go away after stopping the medication.","Symptoms , Diagnosis"
Lupus,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/lupus/392/could-i-have-lupus,Could I have Lupus?,"Hello, I am a 26 year old male living with a variety of ailments yet to be treated effectively. After extensive research online, I have several reasons to believe that I am one of the few male suspects with lupus.  At age 8, I began losing hair in splotches along the back of my head which would soon be diagnosed as alopecia areata. Shortly after, strange reoccurring rashes began forming along my knees and random places around my arms and neck. These rashes were diagnosed as both a dermatitis and eczema by different dermatologists. These rashes and stints of alopecia have occurred randomly and consistently throughout my life.   At age 14, I began to notice widespread rashes forming on both arms below the line of my shirt sleeves anywhere my skin was exposed to the sun. These rashes continue to occur every spring and summer and slowly retract during the fall and winter months. This was also when I realized the excessive dryness of my hair, scalp and face. I began treatment with certain prescription soaps and shampoos, all of which were unsuccessful. These symptoms still exist today. This was also the approximate time in which the lymph node behind my left ear began swelling at random times, often 3-5 times per month, followed by a feverish feeling up to an hour or two. This swelling and fever still occurs today.   At age 18, I began experiencing crippling depression and fatigue for no apparent reason as I have always been a fairly happy person. These periods of suicidal thoughts, depression and fatigue come about unprovoked and make almost any normal activity impossible. These streaks will come to an abrupt end and I will wake up feeling 100% normal and happy. I was diagnosed bipolar type II by my psychiatrist at age 23 with minimal help from a variety of anti-depressants and anti-psychotics, which I chose to stop taking after 2 years due to fatigue, foggy mind and the risk of dependence.  At age 22, I began experiencing unprovoked chronic low back pain. An MRI showed 2 bulged discs as well as abnormal narrowing of the spine for someone of that age. After 3 epidural injections I was advised to undergo surgery by my primary physician. I was referred to a spine surgeon at OU Medical Center who upon consultation suggested surgery would not relieve much pain as his diagnosis leaned toward osteoarthritis.   At age 25, I lost over 60 lbs in a matter of two months after no change in diet or physical activity. I began experiencing intense reoccurring joint pain in my knees, hips, and hands, especially in the morning and late at night, along with consistent nerve pain stemming from my left buttox down into my quad. Various anti inflammatory drugs were prescribed to subdue the pain, although I soon developed stomach ulcers and rectal bleeding.  Now, at age 26, I continue to deal with all symptoms listed above on either a consistent or reoccurring basis, and new symptoms have emerged. In the last three months, I have started experiencing constant constipation, hemmeroids, rectal bleeding and abdominal pain. The most recent symptom, which began a few months ago, is the ""butterfly"" rash on my face notoriously associated with lupus. It produces redness and elevation of the skin with a burning sensation rather than an itching sensation, lasting several days or up to a week. Lupus seems to coincide the best with my research, but I would like outside opinions.","Living & Managing , Symptoms , Treatment , Diagnosis"

In a nutshell, I have tried two primary physicians who were not able to give me a correct explanation about symptoms I am experiencing. the only answer was they don't know.  So far I have experienced UTI like symptoms but all the test came up negative. I had swallowed lymph nodes in my groin that comes and goes. Since 8 months i am experiencing allergies to some food ,I can no longer drink coffee, no gluten or any type or cereal otherwise will be inching within a couple of minutes. I also had some episodes of total fatigue in a way that I cannot even move my body, I had to rest for a while before being able to do anything. But what really scares me is the white particle or worm-like strings in my urine(maybe white cells). doctors still cannot figure this out. all urine test came up negative. In addition, I am having poor blood circulation symptoms. I cannot even kneel down and pray without feeling cramp and tingling like when you sit on your feet for a while. it happens also when I am in the bed, I cannot fold my arms without feeling the same sensation. I have to sleep with my arm and leg flat. all this started 8 months ago when I experienced a huge series of symptoms: pain in the back, itching and tingling, metal taste or bidder tongue, fatigue and so on, pain in my chest like something stinging my heart. I don't know what to do and really don't know who else to talk to.  I remember that I use to have the lymph node in my groin since I was a kid, but I thought that was important. I also had some episodes of very light fever. I thought that was normal since it did not last more than one day.  if you know anyone who can help, please let me know. I can feel that my body is going through a lot of changes but no doctor is able to help. I see that many people with lupus experience the same symptom, that is why I really want to check with another doctor.

Raynaud's makes me quite sensitive to cold - even in the middle of summer, going by the freezer section in the grocery store is uncomfortable. In the winter, I am known for and teased about how many layers I wear. Just recently, my internist found a spot on one lung. Had all kinds of tests and finally got referred to a pulmonologist. He zeroed in on S & R, telling me either one very possibly could have caused the spot.  Life wasn't too bad when my lupus was active, but I sure DON'T LIKE the side effects it left me with. Overall, I try to avoid taking any long-term meds. IMO, taking meds for the long-term messes with Mother Nature. Obviously, there are times when something in your body goes wonky and you need to take a med for a while. For me, epilepsy has been an exception. I have tried not taking seizure meds and been convinced that I need them.  I'd love to hear from others who have lived with S & R for a long time and felt the evil effect.",

Past medical history is: diagnosis of celiac disease as a child, factor mthfr heterozygous, and inappropriate sinus tachycardia. My sx began about 7 years ago when I developed a DVT in my calf. During that year, I experienced many Upper resp infections, sinus infections and strep. I developed a rash on my face and my dermatologist mentioned that it looked like a lupus rash to her. I went off to college and had ups and downs, but remained fairly well. After graduating, I have been sick, lethargic and rundown with a fever for nearly 4 months. I am a RN in an ICU. I have been on antibiotic after antibiotic, and the only relief I have is when I am on prednisone. I am small for my age 5'3."" And 100 lbs, so long term steroid usage is probably not a good idea. I have had a lot of bone breaks, but not due to low bone density. I had labs done last week due to fever of unknown origin and vertigo and a decline in cognitive function and overall feeling terrible. My CBC and Chem were fine but ANA was 1:340 and homogenous with ANA ab positive. DS-DNA was negative. Can anybody shed some light on what could be going on?

I'm 39 yr female and have numerous health concerns but I never go to the DR because I don't want to be seen as a hypochondriac or a drug seeker. Here is a little background, I have had mental health issues all of my life including depression, anxiety and addiction issues. Many people in my family also have addiction issues. In 2010 I got meningitis and nearly died. After I was having body pain all over, I had MRI's and blood test and was given Oxycodone and Morphine. Well guess what happened? Yup addiction but after a while I got tired of having withdrawals so I just stop taking them, but I then replaced that with alcohol. That caused me to have an ulcer that perforated, sepsis, and organ failure in 2017. My dad also died at this same time, we were both in the hospital. I quit drinking after that but only because I almost died again. Now I think I have replaced alcohol with stimulants and food. I am still having health problems, I don't know if I am depressed but I really don't care about anything. I don't want to do anything unless I'm high and I don't like being sober because it's boring. My boyfriend and I fight all the time because ""I don't care,don't listen, and don't pay attention to him when he is talking. I'm pretty sure I have ADHD which I just kind of figured out recently, my memory is terrible, and I really just want to be left alone most of the time. I just feel like I am so messed up, that there is no help for me or don't know if I just don't want it (help). Does anyone else have any of these same issues? Just wanted to know what to do, I know I probably need therapy but have no insurance right now. Thanks","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression , Substance Abuse , Bipolar Disorder"

Except I get overwhelming feelings of depression and I don’t know why. I have a nice new house, my kids are making big accomplishments, I have a very cute dog, my husband loves me and I love him, we are going on a vacation in the fall. What is wrong with me?? I feel guilty even writing this, how dare I complain! I just feel.. useless. Worthless, unimportant, stupid, like people would be better off without me, sometimes even my own kids. I love them more than anything, I’d do anything for them, which is why I’d never act on my feelings. I couldn’t hurt them like that, or my husband, my parents. I’ve felt this way on/off since high school, my journals are so depressing, I can barely read them without feeling utter embarrassment. I have a few friends, I consistently push them away or keep them at a distance and they hang around. I don’t know why. When I’m out I put on a heck of a show. I smile all the time, sometimes until my face hurts. It’s almost a habit at this point. My friends don’t truly know me. I’ve tried telling my husband how I feel but I don’t think he understands, he thinks I need a job. But I can’t take good enough care of my kids and work. I don’t feel like I have enough strength. I don’t talk to him about it anymore, he has enough to do being the breadwinner, he can’t earn all the money and take care of me, it’s not fair. So I struggle. Does anyone out there understand?

I barely pay rent, student loans start this month, I have 2 jobs but don’t have much extra money so I never go out and have fun with friends anymore. I’ve been losing interest in video games that I play and I get angry at the most stupid things. When I look at myself in the mirror I see all the things I’ve messed up on and I feel like I have very low self confidence. I don’t want to look good, and when my girlfriend compliments me I just say no and ask her to stop. All of this has obviously affected my relationship, to the point that we go weeks without having sex because I’m never in the ‘sexy’ mood. She hates it and constantly jokes about to try to get me to realize what I’m missing, but I only get sucked deeper into feeling sad and mad at myself for not being how I use to. I try to explain why I feel this way to her but she just thinks I’m using excuses and has even pushed me to take meds which is 100% my last option and she knows that. I feel like she doesn’t support me the way I want and just wants me to be better but I know that won’t happen overnight. How do I get her to understand that there is no simple fix and even tho I’ve made her feel hopeless, I just need support when I’m acting stupid instead of her getting mad at me and pushing me further into my depressive and anxious thoughts? Also, I’d like to join a support group to talk about my feelings and possibly connect with other cisgender men who don’t subscribe to gender norms but feel like the people in their life pushes them to be who they aren’t.

I am new to these boards and come seeking advice. I have a close friend who is narcoleptic. He has been so for many years now. Throughout these many years he has tried many different medications, all have worked to some extent or another BUT all have ended up making him sick. Why? This is because he has a rare allergy to an ingredient that is found in a lot of common pill-form medicines. The exact name escapes me at this moment but I think it's something along the lines of Titanium Dioxide. These medications always end up getting him bladder infections.  Just in the last year he was suggested Xyrem by doctor, and as far as I know, it did help him to control his sleeping and he got better for a short period of time, however ... after a couple of months this medicine ended up getting him horribly depressed (part of the known side effects I am guessing) and he has actually had to go on anti-depressants. Unfortunately, the anti-depressants have had minimal effect in out-weighing the Xyrem. He has been struggling for the better part of the last 6 or 7 months with his narcolepsy, Xyrem and his anti-depressants. Nothing seems to work for him and he cannot seem to break himself from the funk he is currently in. The drugs together seem to be turning him into a zombie. As far as I know, he's already seen a couple of different doctors regarding the situation, but I have no idea how those visits have gone. I am fearful for his mental health at this point and am wondering if anyone else has any experience with a situation like this?  Does anyone know any good specialists in the surrounding Columbus OH area? Any kind of vitamin or diet techniques that might help?  Any kind of advice, suggestions, or feedback would be helpful. Thanks in advance. I also made this post in the sleep thread, but I thought since it has to do with mental health as well, it might be a good fit here as well.",

I believe I've had it for a while but was in denial. I did not want to take drugs to feel happy. I thought I could self-heal. But all I did was avoid the problem. I'm addicted to TV shows. I watch a lot of them because I would rather live in the fictional world than deal with my life. I lost my younger sibling to cancer some time ago and it was a huge blow. I also recently lost my job but now am going to start a new one. The time I've spent at home, has made life more miserable for me. Its been like a rabbit hole. All day I would watch TV. I would avoid cooking, cleaning, even eating sometimes. I would avoid spending time with my husband or even being intimate with him. Nothing except watching a good TV show gives me joy. Since I seek happiness, I watch more and more TV. Some times I would go out with my husband shopping, hopeful that it would be a pleasurable experience. But as long as I am outside, I am secretly waiting to return home and binge on a new show. How do I get out of this rut? I've recently started bupropion, but I feel its also making me more anxious than usual. I want what to do, but I have no urge to do it. I just want to feel happy, like I used to be many many years back. I want to have that abandon and carefree joy that I felt as a teenager.

So i'd come to the point, which is not one but many. I am in class 10th, good at my studies but only when i study. I mean in the beginning of this session i.e. in april, i was among the top 10 students in my class.  I had been studying in st. mary's school since LkG till my 9th. After that i came to the school i am in presently. I changed my school because 1) i thought i'd be able to focus on my studies here 2) i'll make new good friends and not think much about our friendship(not overthink about friends) 3) will make a new good image of myself  Its not like i didn't focus on my studies in mary's but just that till 8th i was the class topper but in my 9th i was sick for the entire year. i hardly went to school and scored 70 percent in my annuals which was very shocking for everyone as i had scored 10 cgpa in past all the classes. so people thought of me as a girl who has now stopped studying when i was actually ill. Also, i hated my friends there. They actually made fun of me every time and i couldn't reply back to them because 1) i didn't want to because i know it hurts and 2) i didn't know how to reply to such comments  In this school, my new school, initially i barely talked to anyone then a few weeks later i was appointed as the class monitor and so i had to talk to everyone. gradually, i made friends here and got frank with them and i enjoyed my school. i still do. its fun because they find me funny and i love to make them laugh knowing that i did not insult anyone or hurt anyone while cracking jokes. its kind of a satisfaction to know i am funny without being rude. But at the same time, i miss my school. I miss it a lot. I miss my friends. No matter what, but the friendship i had with them is not the same as i have now. Students in my new school are kinds weird maybe because its not a convent school. I am not too comfortable being around them. They are different. I cant say certain things in front of them because it makes me look like a complete uneducated person. They act as if they are from some very well educated family who earns like a million in a month when actually its not true. They fake things around and even a small word like stupid is something very big for them. students here are also too much into studies, which is good but it becomes boring after a point. So, in short, i don't like this school and i have stopped being regular after august.  if you're still reading then thank you The thing that has been troubling me a lot lately is my previous school friends. Two of them are in the same coaching and we meet every alternate day but they don't even look at me. I mean i dont what what changed except my school that they stopped talking to me. I intentionally took the evening batch so that i could meet at least 2 of my friends but they don't bother to say a hello. I expected something very different. I thought we'd sit together and discuss my new school and whats all happening in mary's and whats going on and stuff and study together. After i changed my school , i used to call each of my friends every now and then but when i realised they aren't interested in talking to me i stopped calling them first. And not so surprisingly, they didn't call me even once. I am upset, really upset.  My 9th class was a really bad one. I was into self harm since my 8th class that i rarely did something more than scratching with a compass and that too just once or twice in the entire year. But 9th class left me with scars. I started using a blade and my hand was so ugly to even look at after it was filled with blood all over. I thought of myself as a complete mess. I thought i was so annoying that i should not weven talk to anyone and yes, i didn't talk to anyone. I stayed quiet most of the time and got upset at very small stuff. I changed a lot in the initial of my 10th but i am back to the same point now. My hand is full of scars, even my thigh too. I wonder what i am gonna do after the winters end. How am i gonna face my parents! I have this urge to destroy my hand completely with a blade whenever i feel down and the problem is i feel down every alternate day. The feeling is so bad that even thinking about it can make me cry. I couldn't help but rush to the washroom with a blade. It actually calms me down. I stop crying after it and i forget whatever just happened. Its so relaxing. I cant explain how good it feels. It kills all the feelings i was going through a few minutes back. I know its wrong but i cant help. My ex best friend once called my mom and told her about it. After i returned from my coaching she cleverly checked my hand and almost cried. My father took me to the hospital for injection. They were both very disappointed. They thought of me as a very strong girl but i was this strong girl till my 5th or 6th class. I grew weaker n weaker after that.  I have had suicidal thoughts and I've been wondering what could be the best option. I have had days wen i researched a lot about how to kill yourself and i probably wouldn't have been alive if i found an appropriate way that time. I've bought sleeping pills but after i read an article that there are no 100 percent chances that you'd die, i threw them away. When i die, i want to die in 1 go, no going to the hospital. Sometimes i wonder if i'd be able to survive for long with such *** in my head. But i recently lost my grandfather. My father has completely broken down and i cant see him like this. He's very emotional but it makes my cry to see him like that. 2019 has had a bad start. It is so so depressing right now. Though one thing good that has happend is that i have decided not to ever commit suicide after seeing that my family is so weak. I cant put them into such a bad situation.  Mid october to mid november , i tried to change myself a lot and i guess i even did. But i don't know, i am being dragged into the darkness again. I have thought of killing everyone in my house and then killing myself. Even i know its really stupid but just a thought.  thanks for still reading Its been almost 3 weeks now that i am crying daily. Self harm is very normal for me now. I feel upset all the time. I don't wish to talk to anyone. I don't reply to anyone's text. I cant study. The minute i start studying, i have such depressing thoughts. I sit alone crying. I go for a bath, i cry a lot and i come out. I just feel sad all the time. I have got actually no friends at all whom i can share anything with. I cant share my suicidal feelings with my family obviously and at this time, not at all. I really want to go meet a friend hug her and cry it all out. I desperately need a hug and i know the second i get a hug from a close friend, i am gonna start crying because i have been holding all this in from a long time now.  I have been into the online world since my 7th class and i love talking to strangers. I have 3-4 online friends whom i am close to. I can share everything with them but again, i have been sharing my things with people sitting far away for a much long time now. I now want someone in real. I want to talk to them face to face. I want a shoulder to cry on. But that's not happening. I have searched for online psychiatrists but i get landed in some random chat room with same depression n anxiety n stress. I once asked my dad to take me to a psychiatrist to which he said yes but i didn't have the guts to ask again and also, i don't want dad to know even a thing. I don't want to trouble him.  even a small argument with anyone gets me into so much of thinking. The minute i hear something which i don't want to, there's this heavy feeling. My heart skips a beat and i feel so much load on my chest. its the worst feeling in the world. my facial expressions turn so weir that i could sense it myself. i couldn't speak a word. It seems as if that one sentence stole all of my words from me. I have a 100 sentences in my head but they are stuck inside. I don't know what to say and even if i do, i go silent. i just couldn't speak and i walk away. if i am on a call i disconnect. if i am on a video call i hide my face. I don't want anyone to see me like this. I feel embarrassed.  Thanks for reading it all :)","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression , Self Harm"

But I have been experiencing a lot of panic attacks and severe depression and anxiety. I've always had anxiety (OCD) and I panicked every now and then but not as much as now. It all started when I ate thc edible that was 900 mg. I ate little bit day before so it must be less than that but it didn't work so next day when I was at school I ate whole thing. Everything was fine until it kicked in when it did I wasn't panicking until I went to gym class where my anxiety started kicking in, everything was going slow motion kids in front of me were moving really fast and then slow and then things would pause and reverse like a movie. This made my panicking worse I wasn't panicking to the point where I thought I'm gonna die but I panicked a bit. I then went to nurse office when things got out of control and my BP was high and pulse was fast. Long story short next day my anxiety was gone however my vision was very foggy and bright and also I had brain fog. This happened for few days but when I started going to gym class I noticed I would start panicking and everything would start going in slow motion like it was when I was high. I had to tell nurse and go home like every other day it would go away whenever I came back home though. But after a few times i started getting this dream like feeling like everything started seeming fake to me like my surroundings seemed fake I started forgetting things became depressed and even my eating habits changed I was less hungry. So i went to the doctor and let him know i was then prescribed zoloft my anxiety is a bit less as far as panic attacks go there usually worse in morning. But i still feel like my mind is somewhere else while my body is still here it's like I'm stuck in my mind when I go outside people around me seem fake like I'm trapped in a bubble everything seems fake even my body and thoughts. I am really worried and have visited the doctor many times and the answer he always gives me is its anxiety. If someone can please give me some advice on this that would be great because I feel like I'm going mental or something. And I really regret eating that edible now","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression"

Approx 8 weeks ago I was in Cape Town and went to a strip club. Genuine strip club - nothing else going on in there. One of the girls appeared to take a shine to me but I put it down to what goes on in those places. I got a dance and that was that, but she kept coming over. Extremely attractive girl and after way too much vodka, it was hard to resist. She asked about coming to the hotel, I said yes and one thing led to another, we ended up in my room. She did not ask for money at this point and we ended up having sex but it was unprotected due to the alcohol. The most stupid move I have ever made but it happened. I'm well aware that it is the HIV/AIDS capital of the world but still, somehow, went through with it. And I hate myself for it. I don't know if this girl was a sex worker or if she genuinely liked me. No money for sex makes me think, but I just don't know. If she was prepared to do that this night, how many other nights and with whom? There is a strong possibility I could have had unprotected sex with a sex worker in the world's biggest HIV hotbed. I believe I've stupidly taken the biggest risk imaginable here.  When I got home from the trip, the anxiety kicked in massively. I made myself ill beating myself up and was very paranoid reading HIV info online. Eventually after a week, I calmed down and got on with life, knowing that I needed a test but that it may not show for 3 months so I was planning to hold off until that point. However, after 6 weeks I developed a sore throat and deep cough, which I still have. To me it feels far too coincidental so the anxiety is back. I have an appointment 4 days where I will be tested but it is beating me up badly in the meantime. Why I'm looking for advice is - does anyone know just how risky my encounter has been and is it more likely than not given my cough that I may have been exposed? I've looked into ratios etc - it's hard to say what the chances really are but right now I feel like a positive result is inevitable. It could be paranoia but taking into account the location, circumstances, my stupidity and this very deep cough developing at peak time, am I right to be paranoid? Any advice that can be passed on would be of great help to me. Sorry for the long post but I had to get it off my chest and seek advice.  Thank you.  Paul",

This just happened last night and fear has me questioning whether I should seek PEP. I am a male and despite my stupid mistake, have others that rely heavily upon me. After having quite a few drinks last night, I ran into a female social acquaintance whom I have sort of know for a couple of years. She is early 20's and appears clean and in good health. Her friend, a gay male, in the same age range, was with her. The three of us ended up at my place. To make a long story short, they both performed felatio on me, I performed cunnilingus on the female, the female and I had unprotected vaginal and anal sex, and the male rimmed me. He also attempted to insert a finger or two into my anus but I stopped it as quick as possible. He and I did not engage in anal sex either way (though he might have rubbed his penis against my anus briefly, I am not sure if it was his penis or a finger but there was no penetration in that instance), and I did not perform oral sex on him. Also, around five days ago, I developed a sore on the shaft of my penis from vigorous masturbation in the shower. A mark is still present but it appears to have healed over. Afterwards, the female said she has no STD's. The male said he is HIV negative which he knows from testing around 90 days ago. But, this was after the fact and I do not know him. I fear the side effects of PEP, not to mention the cost and having to tell my loved ones and maybe take off from work. I fear HIV, too.  I understand my risk from the sex acts with the female, if she were to be HIV+. Can you tell me the risks from the acts with the male, if any,? And please, can you tell me your thoughts about whether I should go to a doctor for PEP?? Thank you BR",Possible Exposure

Please help,I recently was at a bar with some friends and I drank too much and blacked out. I was told that I got into a fight with them and I socked my best friend in the face and that's something I would NEVER do. Then I was told I left them and they found me about 45 mins later in a riverbed. The next morning I realized that my belt was missing from my pants and then when I went to urinate my Penis had a strong odor that smelled like a urinal at a dirty bar. I never smell like this. Can this odor be from bein dehydrated and urinating during my blackout? It didn't smell fishy or anything and I don't believe I had any dry crustiness from semen or anything from having sex. I know this might sound crazy but because my belt was missing and the odor i was afraid since I was blacked out and didn't know what I was doing I possibly had unprotected sex with a homeless lady in the riverbed.  That is also something I would never do. Ive always had fear and anxiety about getting hiv so Idk if this is just another one of those moments or I possibly could have done something like this.

I'm turning 20 and my parent's still control me like I'm 2. No exaggeration. They used to walk up to my high school to walk me. I was never allowed to attend any birthday parties or any events like that. They are protective beyond the word. My father is extremely abusive and has damaged my whole family and now we are toxic ourselves and don't know how to he normal though we like to think we are or pretend we are. I was bullied since I can remember and still am in my 2nd year of college. I really mean it when I say I am not allowed to do anything. If I go out once in the year with a friend my parent's must meet the person and walk me right to them. I am never allowed to go anywhere without them. I had a 2 month holiday and I sat at home every single day except the few occasion of going on errand runs with them. I'm not allowed to have a boyfriend or even a friend that is a guy. It gets thrown in my face for years even if the relationship/friendship is over. I'm trying really hard to not self harm but the urge is there. I get lectured like a child my whole life and I am not allowed to breathe if it isn't the way my parents want me to. I have no friends whatsoever. Others my age are constantly messaging on their phones and no one messages me for months on end unless someone needs help. I have no cousins, aunts, no family at all they all hate us. I have no one. I have a sister who survived cancer at the age of 18 so ofcourse I have no right to be depressed or hate life. I know I have depression. I know I have anxiety and I don't know what else I have because I cannot seek professional help. My mother is a fanatic Christian so when I went to a psychiatrist she kept lecturing me and throwing it in my face that nothing is wrong with me and it's nonsense to go tell someone my feelings only God can help me. She's very loving but not nurturing and I can never tell her how I feel. The years of bullying and dysfunctional abusive household gave me a sickness. My coping mechanism to deal with stress and anxiety is to vomit. I have practically been vomiting everyday for 5 years. I vomit acid so my throat is permanently damaged. I have always over thought and stressed about everything. Everyone hates me and before even saying hi to me they decide I'm a ***. I've spoken to a psychiatrist twice and I've learnt from speaking to other people as well that it's useless talking to people who haven't been through what I've been because they will never understand and tell me that it's silly to worry about having no one etc. I'm seriously alone, no messages, no social life, even a fake one. No online friends. No one cares that I exist. I would've committed suicide a long time ago but my mother used to scare me that I will burn in hell and I used to be very religious but my mother put me off that. I have no appetite for life, I can barely eat, I hate people, I always have health problems with no one to help me. I was always hated in school because I excelled academically and I swear I never thought I was better than people but they all used to always tell me that to my face and gang up on me. I don't have access to my bank account or cards and we don't have a car so they are making sure to keep me dependent on them. Even if I had friends I could never go out with them. So I guess it's good I have no one. I had to change schools in the past because of the bullying and when my sickness developed and my parents would say that there's nothing wrong with people. It's me. Because I have problems in every school. I have no escape and even if I had one my parent's wouldn't allow it. I am like a prisoner because it must always be what my parents want and say. I must just obey. I have my own reasons for never wanting to get married but even if I wanted to my parent's would never allow it and my father always curses me that I will have a lot of problems if I get married and he doesn't approve of it. No guy is going to want to marry a girl who still lives with her mother and the mother will come on the first date and every other date. She's really like that. My dad would have problems too but I would keep it from him. I say I will live with him because people always say they'll stand on their own when they work and will have freedom but my mother really plans to live with us forever. I don't want to keep living like her prisoner but at the same time how can I be so desperate to get away from her when I'll be completely alone and no one will want me.

We've only been dating for 4 months, so I only found out recently that she deals with this. She's told me before that she gets anxious, but starting last month she was acting very distant and then she finally told me that she was feeling more anxious than normal and that she was depressed. She said this is something that she goes through every now and again. She feels anti-social and the only way she knows how to deal with it is to isolate herself from everyone. She reassured me that this has nothing to do with me or our relationship and to not take it personally. I immediately responded by saying that I understand & accept the fact that she is going through something and that she needed her space. Over the past month I've been reading any article online I can find on depression, anxiety, dating someone with depression, etc. I don't suffer from this myself so I've been doing everything I can to educate myself and try to get some idea of what she's going through. I thought asking for advice on here from people who go through depression and are in a relationship could be very helpful and give me some peace of mind. I've seen her once for a few hours since the beginning of the year, whereas the first 3 months we dated we saw each other at least once a week and more if our schedules aligned. It's frustrating and then I feel selfish for feeling that way because I know that she's not doing this on purpose. I send her messages to have a good day at work or in general. She takes her time but she usually responds and says thank you so much. I ask her how she's doing. Sometimes she doesn't respond and I can never tell if I should keep texting her or leave her be. Maybe even of she doesn't respond, she still enjoys reading messages from me? I would like to know any and all ways that I can on how to support her and be there for her. Also if there's anything in particular I should be saying to her for support. Or things I should stop saying/doing or not say at all. Any advice would be greatly appreciated and I thank anyone in advance who took the time to read this and give advice.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression"

Within the past week I've been worried about having HIV or something, since I've never been tested before. About 4-5 years ago I went through a phase with guys where I experimented with sex, I've only had unprotected sex with one person and we had been dating for over 9 months, and I also tried anal with him (without a condom), other than that I've always used protection when having sex. I've had about 3 guys attempt to stick their penis in, only getting the tip in for about 3-4 seconds (without condoms) and I've given blowjobs to 2 guys. Since then I've been dating someone for about 2 years and we always use a condom, I have given him blowjobs and he has gone down on me as well, I know for a fact that he doesn't have HIV because he's been tested. But I'm worried about myself... I haven't had any symptoms really, but I read somewhere that people with HIV tend to get gum disease and I was diagnosed with Periodontal Disease about a week ago, and about a week ago I noticed that my tongue was yellow, and I know that is a rare symptom of HIV. Other than that I've have a few yeast infections, but that's it. I don't know if I'm overreacting or not and I was wondering if anyone could tell me what they think? Do you think I have HIV just from what I've said (I am going to set up an appointment to get tested) please let me know what you think! Thank you!

(While drinking I notice slight blood on her teeth & gums & when eating apple, also I notice red/orange color on my groin area while washing at my home) Later, I tried to contact her, but she left to Philippines and I came to know where she was working that, she failed in her medical and was medically terminated as she was hiv positive. So she was untreated and highly infectious. I would like to know  What are my risk of acquiring hiv from Unprotected oral insertive sex with bleeding gums and multiple cuts on the penis/scrotum and groin area bearing the scrotum skin is very thin and sensitive. The hand massage was rough & the lot of force was applied, so, there could be possibility the blood mix with saliva, which was present on the groin area, was rigorously pressed toward the superficial cut, which could have opened and allowed it to enter the blood stream.  Also, she drink the alcohol before the blowjob, so the alcohol can deactivate the protective enzymes and protein of saliva.  I would like to know, what is more risky & dangerous, the multiple cuts or urethra. I have been browsing your forum and this forum has been consistently denying any risk of hiv from oral sex/exposure outside of body, The only risk is from vaginal and anal unprotected sex. Also, it is claimed that, hiv is very fragile virus, once it is exposed to air, it is unstable or not transferrable to infect. So, my question is if the infected blood from her mouth went to the cuts, so it may take maximum 2-3 seconds, so the virus is exposed to air and thus it will be unstable immediately or can live in the air for a while.  I also would like to know the seroconversion duration, whether it is 7-10 days or 7-14 days, upto 4 weeks, upto 6 weeks, or 6 months or forever. I don’t know what’s your research & first peer science reviewed study says. After 27 days of exposure, I am having ongoing symptoms since 3+ months, flu like symptoms, low grade fever every day with chills, white tongue, fatigue, tiredness (NO RASH & SORE THROAT). The most bothering is mild to moderate Myalgia/Arthralgia since 3+ months. Did all the blood test, sputum test, arthritis, TB, thyroid, uric acid, kidney & liver function, xray, ctscan, mri. But the symptoms is still going on. Only High Esr (40) & some inflammation is there in the body. Did thrice antibiotic course of 5 days twice, but no improvement. Cannot sit/work or sleep in AC, feel whole body hot (but not more than 37.5) with mild/moderate body & joint aches/fatigue. My Doctor is clueless about my ongoing symptoms, he cannot diagnose me since 3+ months. Unable to function, sit, walk, sleep, relax or concentrate on anything.  Also, is their Ongoing retroviral syndrome, instead of acute retroviral syndrome where you don’t recover from the sickness {Read Dr Sean from Freedomhealth), It make me to scare till death, as My symptoms is ongoing and I am not recovering. Maybe My immunity CD4 has been very down. Most reputable hiv doctors accepts, there is risk in giving Blowjob, So, I wanted to know, If the giver is blowing with his bleeding gums & the infected body fluid (semen/blood) from the receiver can infect the giver thru his bleeding gums, then why not the blood of giver can infect to the receiver through urethra or cuts. I have been browsing your forum since 1 years for oral sex, before going to Filipina for receiving oral sex and I was confident but, since I got the symptoms, I lost all hope. My case is different as all those who were previously received or gave blowjob they did not have so long ongoing symptoms which is classic ars flu like symptoms.  To be fair, I am very afraid of going for hiv test, due to ongoing flu type typical ars symptoms since 3+ months. Also, their is no anonymous confidential test in dubai, else I have to go india for test.  Thanks & god bless you. Read more:",

Before we began we brushed out teeth (no flossing, just brushed). We enganged in mostly unprotected oral sex, from her to me. About 5 minutes of unprotected oral sex from me to her (only her clitoris) and finally protected vaginal sex during which she peed on my pelvis and a very brief attempt to anal sex (like 30 seconds or so). After we finished, we showered individually, even using diferent soap bars and towels. I checked with water the condom we used for vaginal and anal and it didn't break. About 8 - 9 days after this I developed a light fever 99.32 F (37.4 C) which lasted about 10 or 12 hours, the fever came with a light headache (which was more dizziness than an actual headache). Today, day 13 the fever has not returned since it went away, but this headache/dizziness thing keeps bugging me. No other symptoms have occurred. I know my exposure is considered low risk and that the likeliness of a CSW to be infected is relatively low and also that the only way to know if I am infected or not is through testing at 4 weeks and retesting at 3 months, but still I wanted some serious opinions on whether or not you think I should be concerned.

At the time we stopped because we were trying to avoid a pregnancy risk.  Background: This guy isn't exactly a ""stranger"" in the sense that he was a one night stand. I know him, but we reconnected after about 5 years. I asked him before we started fooling around if he was clean and he assured me that he was, he gets tested every couple of months for work, and he hasn't been with anyone else in almost a year. Again, this is just his word we're relying on here. Anyway, things didn't work out for other reasons and I broke it off.  6 weeks later I started freaking out. It wasn't like I had any ""symptoms"" I just couldn't get the thought out of my head that we had unprotected sex because that's something I NEVER DO. It was a very rare ""heat of the moment"" thing for me. So, at 6 weeks I took an at home OraQuick test and it was negative.  I took ANOTHER test just today (about 88 days/12.5 weeks) and it was negative again. I also got blood work done today (which includes HIV testing) at the OBGYN and will get my results in about two weeks.  I. AM. STILL. FREAKING. OUT. I have this stupid little dermatitis irritation above my lip that is annoying me. I went to the dermatologist today too and she really wasn't concerned and gave me a little medicine for it.  My anxiety is killing me. I've read almost every blog about negative results after 3 months and shouldn't still be this anxious over the blood test. I can't recall having ""flu-like symptoms"" soon after our sexual encounter, but I did suffer from gastritis two weeks after it happened, but I haven't read anything that ties gastritis to HIV. I know, only testing is the way to know for sure and not by symptoms. I get that.  I just wish I could trust the home test, and not worry about the blood test. It's so incredibly strange. Please help to put my mind at ease. I have awful anxiety episodes over this every day, I feel claustrophobic all the time and I'm smoking way more cigarettes than I normally do to try and calm down.

I was ingesting a large amount of caffeine and energy supplements. I started having symptoms, including but not limited to, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). I was put on Cymbalta and told to limit my caffeine intake. I was also diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder with uncued panic attacks, hence the Cymbalta.  Fast forward a few years: Due to monetary reasons, I had to try other medications instead of Cymbalta. I tried Zoloft, but it made me homicidal and suicidal. I tried Effexor, but it gave me this ""electrical tingling"" feeling all over. I was placed back on Cymbalta at 90 mg which gave me the same feeling as the Effexor. As a result, my dose was lowered to 60 mg.  Fast forward to now: I'm now 28 and I work as a paramedic. Within the past few months, I have been having episodes of panic with physical symptoms, such as: tremors, vision changes, shortness of breath, intense fear, etc. I still take Cymbalta 60 mg. I've also been prescribed Hydroxyzine 50 mg PRN and Valium 2 mg PRN.  I know it's the anxiety and panic. I've had multiple tests ran that show no physical issues, but part of my fear is almost hypochondria.  I do have other co-morbidities such as hypertension, GERD, and hypothyroidism. What do I do? The attacks are becoming more frequent and more physically exhausting. I do have a stressful line of work, so I'm sure that doesn't help any.

We had three rounds of penile-vaginal sex. The first two rounds we went from kissing to fondling and then went straight to vaginal sex. We used new condoms each round. And he ejaculated in the condom. After ejaculating, he dried his penis with a towel. All times. At the beginning of the third round, we stopped and I ended up, in the heat of a moment, performing unprotected oral on him for no longer than two or three minutes. No ejaculation, pressumably no pre-ejaculatory fluids. At the time, I had what I'm assuming is a burn at the roof of my mouth that was healing after I peeled the little flap of skin. It was kind of sore. What is my risk? Also we cuddled between rounds and his penis would rest close to my vagina would this be a risk?

I am expanding my boundaries on talking to people. Right now I am just talking to people online.

A couple of months ago I had reconnected with a friend from high school (who I had a falling out with for personal reasons) and a couple of days ago I responded to someone's ""I need a friend"" posts. I want to talk, I want to have a conversation, but it always seems like I am asking all of the questions, or bringing another topic to talk about so the conversation continues. It's frustrating! I want to talk about my life too, and not just have them repeat the question I asked them. Or worse yet- have them cut back to the first statement of an actual conversation that we've had, leaving nothing else to talk about. For example ""I love watching Westerns..... this is what I love about them..... this is how you feel about them..... I love watching Westerns."" There is no leading into another topic, there is no cue on where to go with it, it just stops. So I ask another question, and it happens again. So I bring up another topic (movies), and it happens again. This isn't like a one time, ""hey how are you doing"" conversation. It goes on and on, everyday we talk and everything we talk about.

I am constantly overwhelmed, and life almost never feels safe for me because I do not feel I am up to it’s tasks by any stretch of imagination. Other effects from these issues are IBS, alergies, and chronic pain.  One time I went to the ER with Colitus, and a very kind doctor prescribed Prednisone for me. There are no words to describe all it did for me. It not only helped my colitus, but my allergies and chronic pain subsided. Even more importantly, instead of feeling buried under life’s tasks with my usual depression and anxiety, I felt completely calm and full of confidence that I was competent to deal with all I had to do. It wasn’t like a “high” either. Rather it seemed as though I had been given something I had always been missing. I cannot begin to describe how much I want that experience again.  My question—what is in that stuff that could give me all I lacked? It seems it would be an excellent pursuit to find out how it works on people like me and develop a comparable medication that could be used long-term.

SSRIs are not a cure all and are extremely dangerous. They destroyed my health and life. Make sure you speak to anyone pushing these dangerous meds that say they help for numerous mental health or physical symptoms. I was put on many everyone did horrible damage to me and my poor son lived through the aftermaths. I was told the many many “safe” antidepressants antipsychotic anti seizure meds (gabapentine) were for sleep anxiety pain etc and they almost killed me but did kill the family relationships I had and after numerous hospital visits that I was forced to take these meds ultimately gave me PTSD on top of panic anxiety and severe pain. If I had been treated for anxiety and panic attacks instead of symptoms of these I wouldn’t have lost the life I had. Docs don’t monitor your on these and don’t listen when you’re begging them to help when you think you are dying and or going crazy. I went off them and after the severe fog lifted I was truly living a nightmare and after 3 years still living it. Be very careful and hopefully you have people in your life that can help you and fight doctors (even now the gov controlling healthcare). Make sure you get correct diagnosis and prescriptions for your actual problem not this or that MIGHT help they usually don’t and make you worse.

I explain briefly my situation. Exactly a week ago I was with an escort. I specify that I had no insertive direct relationship. My concern is that I rubbed my penis on the breast of the escort for a time less than one minute. My anxiety, then, is related to the possibility that a previous customer have come on the breast, and if that had happened, although there were no clear signs of liquid on the breasts, some microscopic residual can be entered in touch with my glans.  The other issue relates to the fact that the escort opened a condom and put it first on the bed, and after about ten minutes she inserted it on my penis to practice a masturbation. Here the question is similar to the previous one, namely: what if the condom entered in contact to any seminal fluids and / or blood and the latter can then be entered in contact with the condom and then with my glans???  I would therefore like to know if these are modes of transmission of any infectious disease and especially HIV or hepatitis.  I precise that since some days I feel a sense of burning in the foreskin of the penis and a feeling of constantly having to go to urinate, which happens.  Dear Doctor, please, clarify my doubts. Interests of clarity, I specify that the escort has even touched my penis without a condom, it is possible that she had dirty hands, and in this way gave me some sort of infections which among other things cause these my burning sensation??  Last question, is it true that hiv virus dies outside the body and how much amount of viruses is need to happen the contagion, a drop would be enough?

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/77589/panic-attacks,Panic attacks?,"In September I began having panic attacks. The first one I ever experienced was while I was driving. It completely came out of no where. I felt my heart beating rapidly, tingling sensation that shot down thru my body, dizziness, as felt heavy, face felt drained. I thought I was having a stroke. I had to pull over twice. Sobbing and crying my boyfriend drive me to the hospital where I they told me I was experiencing a panic attack. A few weeks later I experienced another one that also landed me in the hospital. while at the E R I told the nurse I wanted to be tested for everything; high blood, diabetes, cancer, ringworm, just everything. Of course everything came back fine. I had xraya, ct scan, ekg, everything came back I was fine. I followed up with my regular doctor that week and told her what I had been experiencing. That at random I just have these series of attack. I told her that I did not want to be on medication. Stress is something that happens to everyone and dealing with stress is basic coping skill everyone needs to have.I told her that I done research and I discovered niacin has proven to help, and I was taking that to help. Of course she urged against it and recommended that I take zoloft. I told her I was not depressed and I didn't need it. She told me it would help the saratonian in my brain, I had a imbalance and to try it for a month. Well after about 3 weeks I finally broke down after countless crying sessions to my boyfriend about how I was against medication I just need to pray and trust in the Lord and I would be okay, I tried zoloft. Now, I have a low tolerance for medication, so I broke it in half 25mg to start. First day I felt fine. Calm, able to focus. The 2nd day however I felt weird like sluggish, I was also asked my boyfriend when we had a kid, which we do not have btw. I was like oh no, I'm not taking this anymore. It took two days for the medicine to get out of my system I felt so sick. Fast forward, as of late I have been having for frequent attacks. I got a nasty stomach virus followed by a single is infection this week. I had 4 attacks Friday and one today. I am so paranoid I am going to have a attacks k I have not taken any.medicine to help with the sinus infection. I feel !I throat is closing up, my younger feels swollen I can't breath, which I know is from the sinus infection. Obviously breathtaking of your mouth all the time will dry out your tongue and throat to make it feel like you are swollen etc. WHen I have attacks I feel so disoriented. I feel everything is blurry and foggy. I feel sick like I need to lay down the whole day. I have this fear of going out these past few months since they started happening. I freak out in the car when I am driving. I don't even want to get in the car. I don't want to go into a store bc I'm scared it will happen. I can't function like I use too. All I do is cry when I feel these attacks coming on. I feel like no one understands what I a! Going thru and to be honest I don't even know. I do Not want to be on medication at all. I just don't know what to do anymore. I was trying to tell my boyfriend that like I want to go to the hospital when they happen, even tho I know I M okay it's like I want validation I am not dieing.

So my main question is getting people's opinion on who to see over this. I have been experiencing depression symptoms for several years and I was able to ""control"" and hide it, still managing to live successfully without it interfering with most of my daily life. Lately I've noticed its gotten worse the past few months and its not beginning to affect my life and others around me are starting to notice. This seems silly, but even though my closest friends and family are noticing somethings up, I still do not want to talk to them about it yet, as I haven't completely admitted it to myself. I believe one of the ""causes"" could be my thyroid, I've had hypothyroid disease for over 10 years, I'm 21 now, and recently things have gotten worse. I guess my question is which doctor do you think I should see or which have any of you seen and recommend? I don't have a close relationship with either my endocrinologist or family doctor, they're both new and I haven't really connected with either but since they work together with my thyroid issues I can't really switch. Should I try and talk to one of them or just try and find a therapist or something instead first? I know its dumb but I really don't know who to ask without worrying someone in my friends/family but I'm noticing I need to do something about this before it gets worse and I'm not sure which way to turn.

From January to August 2018, my creatinine steadily dropped with the help of a controlled diet and was 2.9 when I started accumulating fluid in my chest cavity. I was advised to go for a CABG which I did after which I needed dialysis as my urine output was NIL. After about 12 sessions of dialysis, my output reached a reasonable level and the creatinine started correcting. I was off dialysis for about 2 months. Unfortunately in November 2018, after a trip to a hill station, I started retaining fluid again, urine was clear and creatinine started climbing steadily and reached 7.0. I was asked to start dialysis again and have been on it for 2 months. My creatinine levels are 3.2 now and urine output above average. Water intake is low and over the past week, I’ve been having episodes that involve profuse sweating, nausea, black outs (that I don’t have any recollection of) and vomitting.

So I came to know about a site on internet that lets you make friends. And so I registered there, behavior there was a lot like dating sites. You don't get any replies if you're below average looking and no initial messages if you aren't girl or extremely good-looking. I realized how much looks matter even for having some friend. This is got me even more depressed, I removed my photo and put anime avatar as display picture. And somehow managed to find 2 friends. I was talking to them daily while still looking for other friends as I couldn't talk to them much because of time differences or because of them already having other tons of friends. I uploaded my pics again for some reason I don't know. After texting 100 people I would get a reply of 1. Mostly would just disappear after 1 reply, some talking so less or taking so long in reply that you lose interest and just give up. Even if I somehow find someone who talks to me, its always has to be me to start to conversation It was like ""I message them, they reply. I don't, they don't."" I hate it and so I never found anyone to talk to other than those 2. Now I'm used to losing friends so I have experience. I know we get hurt when things don't go to our expectations. I've trained myself to not expect what's not in reach. And so I didn't expect that my friendship with those 2 would last forever but I still expected to last it some months and it ended even before that. Now I'm so depressed, this is reality of me for finding friends. I can see the reason why I'm single since birth. I don't see myself anywhere in future either. I don't know if this life is even worth living. I don't remember last time I smiled, felt genuine happiness or even had fun. I'm 16 turning 17 this year and I have been suicidal for last 1 and a half year. The only thing that keeps me going is the fear of after-life. I'm Agnostic and I'm not sure whether there is one or not. What's in it for me, what if it's worse. and I don't want it even if it's heaven. So the only thing I can say I'm alive for is hope that someday human-hibernation would be in my reach so I would be able to hibernate myself for eternity.

I was referred to a neurologist and after a battery of tests, I was sent for an MRI. The neuro said there were lesions present but not enough to diagnose. He said that it was more than likely stress. At the time that was ok with me because I was in the process of leaving a highly stressful job.  Fast forward to today I have had symptoms on and off since the initial MRI but now when they show up they are much stronger. My anti-inflammatories are wearing off even though I'm taking the full dose. I'm seeing some minor memory issues, fatigue (I have 0 energy for my 2 year old), and numbness in my fingers at night.

But I will appologise for how long this might be before hand.  I am a 23yo, female.  Had a Microdiscectomy and Laminectomy when I was 18 and recovered with no deficits whatsoever.  Around April last year (2018) so started to get a few symptoms of sciatica and some numbness of the outside of my left foot. I saw my doctor and had a scan. It's showed a small protrusion, and bone spurs. I was referred back to my neurosurgeon and whilst waiting I started to lose the function of my left foot.  When I arrived to see my Neurosurgeon, he admitted me straight away for further testing.  I had nerve conduction study which showed damage/not a lot of capacity and some radiculopathy of course. But Neurology and neurosurgery said that the protrusion didn't explain the loss of function in that area and that my reflex was diminished but they would operate again. So last year around October, I had surgery again to fix the protrusion (l5.s1) as that was the only possibility causing the numbness and reduced function... or so we thought.  Moving on, after the surgery... I seemed to just slowly get worse. The numbness has spread to my knee now, only leaving the inside of my leg with some feeling.  My Achilles reflex is completely absent, and I have a dropped foot and issues controlling my leg. I returned back to my Neurosurgeon after 6 weeks and he said my lumbar MRI looked normal now and he couldn't understand why my function wasn't improving. He said he was sorry and that he thinks I may have a neurological disorder, or possibly a single tumor causing the problems. We went through some other symptoms that I've had (you know... Those ones that come and go that you don't usually link together) such as numbness in one finger, Numbness at the back of my arm. Weak grip, short headaches, visual problems when I stare at the floor, pain in my back when I put my chin to my chest, and a heap of memory issues (I had electroconvulsive therapy for depression about 4 months before my leg symptoms started and we had attributed the memory loss to this)  And twitching muscles every day. The surgeon just threw MS om the table... I am just confused as surely if I had MS, the surgeon would at least be able to see lesions in the lumbar part of my spine (where I have had a few MRIs) If they are just in my brain, would that cause the leg problems? Can they be microscopic and cause problems? I didn't get to ask questions as I took up so much time, and had to leave.  I am waiting to see my Neurosurgeon once more after I have a nerve conduction study with neurologist coming up and see them too of course (I'm in a really long waiting public system and live 7 hour drive away from the nearest proper hospital)  I'm trying not to worry myself... and what will be will be. I guess I am just curious. Surely lesions should have shown up if it's MS?","Symptoms , Diagnosis"

My latest issue which I am experiencing since the past few months is that now when I am eating something, food or fruits whatever, sometimes between eating I feel that my throat will choke or something and the food will not go down and it will get stuck in my throat or something like that will happen. And that does happen, when I am eating, I feel I wont be able to swallow it and suddenly my breathe stops and I get scared and take out whatever I was chewing and throw it or if I have water with me I drink it along with the food so I can swallow it easily.  Is there actually something wrong with me or its just my mind? I have become too concerned about every little thing. Whatever happens to me, be it a normal cold flu too, I will always associate it with my high blood pressure problem ever since its been diagnosed.

I don't know why I still need to say this but at no time did I ever fight back, I just took it. Anyway, after she assaulted me I was panicked and confused and uncertain as to what to do. So, I ran from my apartment out into below freezing temperatures while only wearing pants and a t-shirt. I contacted a friend who came and patched me up. At this time I decided to not to report any of this. I and my friend knew that if the military police were to get involved, that I would have likely been the one arrested. Knowing how the military works, at least back then, the incident would have gone on my record, and hurt my career. Fortunately for me my wife and I went are separate ways after that. I don't know if my decision was the right one at the time. And to this day, outside of my friend. I have never told anyone of this. And I hope this would be posted anonymously. All that being said I hope that anyone that is experiencing domestic violence or abuse of any kind should get help. Sorry if this isn't written well, but writing isn't my cup of tea.

While riding my Bmx bike I flipped it a few times over the handle bars landing on my chest .

During the x-ray the Dr. stated that I had a shadow in my right lung and wanted to take me for a biopsy the following day . As they did the biopsy (with my left lung having 1000ml of fluid ) the Dr. clipped and artery in my right lung and I spit tons of blood up . After a while I had woke up not knowing what happened . No body told me that I passed away and they had to resuscitate a few times . I was not made aware of this until I was home .  My question is , should they have done the biopsy on my right lung even though my left was full of fluid ?  I'm no Dr. but how would I be able to breath if both lungs are full of liquid ?

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/89158/is-this-too-fast-to-ween,Is this too fast to ween??,"I have been taking Klonopin 1mg, 3 times a day for 12 years. I started taking it after postpartum panic attacks showed up out of nowhere. Unfortunately, the doc that saw me did not warn me about the issues of being on the medication for such a long time – I was a young teen mom who did not know the dangers of this until a few years later after someone sued him for malpractice and had to leave the practice. Over the years I have tired to ween off the med but most of the time I was given some kind of anti-depressant or another - ALL of which sent me into multiple cases of serotonin syndrome and required the need for hospitalization EACH time. The weening had always failed. Fast forward a few years to last year - my doc of 2 years simply left her practice without any notice whatsoever and I was left scrambling to find a new one. Eventually I located the only Doc ( an NP) within a 40 mile radius that was taking new patients and could see me without having to wait 6 months for an appointment. The first appointment this past October was HORIBBLE. I was belittled and made to feel horrible by her about my Klonopin dosage - so much so that I left her office crying for hours and hours (but with a new RX script). She was reported to my insurance company (THEY made me give them details and file when I simply called them for a list of docs in my area who took my insurance and they learned what had happened) but nothing came of it. I had to see her 3 months later though, because AGAIN, I could see no one else for months. When my next and most recent appointment came up last month I was questioned about the report made as I sat there disoriented with the flu and the 105 degree temp that tagged along with it. I was so out of it but I remember telling her that my anxiety and panic disorders were MUCH WORSE when sick. By the time I left, she had refilled my regular 1mg tab, 3 times a day script for ONLY ONE month and it was agreed that I would start AGAIN to ween off the medication the next month. A few days ago my husband picked up my RX. I didn't see it until yesterday but when I DID, it alarmed me. Rather than weening off the med SLOWLY from 1mg 3 times a day, the bottle had only 45 pills instead of the normal 90 pills in it with these EXACT directions: 'Take one tablet by mouth twice a day for 2 weeks, then take one-half tablet by mouth two times a day for 2 weeks, then stop.'  I began FREAKING out! I called the pharmacist who said that this cannot be done! I have been on a pretty high dose for over a DECADE and it would take a LOT longer than a month to ween off of it. She suggested I contact my Dr.'s office, which I did and was told the directions would NOT change and the few pills I have now were ALL i was ever going to get EVER, so I better follow the directions for best results in my weening process. I had my mom come over and she helped me make calls all over town trying to find out if this was safe or not (which I know darn well without being told that it is NOT). We called so many doctors looking to get me in somewhere else but there was NOTHING! No one could offer up any advice short of going to the ER (at this point I was well-into my 8th panic attack inside of 2 hours and each one was worse than the last.) My family doc refused to even deal with assisting me in advice. (Now, just a bit of side info needed to help you fully understand everything a bit clearer: this past July I had major surgery which I woke up in the middle of and now have severe anxiety, nightmares and PTSD over. 2 weeks after that I was sent to the ER for dehydration from the stomach bug but rather than giving me a nausea med IV, I was given an anti-psychotic that messed me up beyond horrible (I spent 12 following hours sitting in the cold shower screaming hysterically as it felt like my brain was on fire) and because of the 2 hospital incidents I have now developed a mild but serious degree of agoraphobia. The only 2 times I have left my home in 9 months were to see this NP and I had to be VERY sedated to do so. Also, the manufacturer of the brand of Klonopin I had been on for over 11 years was bought out by a different company who changed the medication formula completely and now the med is only about as HALF as effective (at most) as the discontinued brand, but needed nonetheless- I have tried 4 other manufactures brands but they all caused their own issues and bad side-effects from what I am told from my doc, is the inactive ingredients that can and DO completely change how a med can work in a person, especially for someone who is hyper-sensitive to meds like myself. I have a laundry list of health problems: type 1 diabetes with severe nerve damage in over 75% of my body (including the inability to feel or move any part of my body from the knees down), 2 heart conditions & a pacemaker, high blood pressure, insomnia since 3 years old, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Diabetic Gastroenteritis. other causes of PTSD, and Seizures just to name a few and I just turned 30 last month.   Right now I am terrified, to put it mildly, and I have NO idea what to do, who to talk to, or anything really. My hours of freaking out earlier have mentally exhausted me but I am too restless for sleep or rest – I have and have had pure adrenaline coursing through me all day and I feel like I'm in some sort of 'brain fog' mentally. I am terrified despite how much I try to convince myself otherwise, that I am going, or soon will go, crazy, have a permanent breakdown or will feel horrible like this for a long time, if not forever. I saw a therapist for 8 years and it really didn't do much. My husband does not understand much of what I'm going through, my mother has a lot of medical issues of her own she is having to deal with and I have ZERO friends to talk to. Nothing helps me chill out and relax and I have both desperately and wholeheartedly tried almost everything from yoga, exercise, walking in the fresh air (I physically can not run with my Footdrop), TRYING to learn & practice meditation (but only epically failing), journaling, CBD oil and Hemp oil, prayer, SO MANY self-help and workbooks, listening to relaxing sounds or deep theta binaural beats/sound waves, various hobbies (adult coloring books, candle making, etc.), aromatherapy, and so-on. What am I supposed to do about the 'weening so fast off Klonopin' thing? Currently, I am having 3-4 panic attacks per hour, insomnia (up for 77 hours now), random feelings of intense fear and crying, tremors, heart palpitations, high blood pressure and so-on. I need all the GOOD advice I can get right now, no trolling. Thanks for taking the time to read this and hopefully reply kindly to.

Sometimes that leads to hanging out when she’s done working if she doesn’t have other plans. When we part ways we usually hug so I know she likes me. If I text her it is extremely difficult to get a reply but I will see she read the message. I tell her if i’m Texting too much and being annoying let me know but I still don’t get a reply so it is difficult to tell what’s up.

The past year has been awful for me. This may be a long post because I haven't been able to really talk to anyone about this and how it is affecting me because when I first start to say something about it people usually shrug it off and say I am just tired or being lazy. With that said, here it goes. About 10 year ago, I started having difficulty dealing with cold. My hands started to turn really red. I just shrugged it off because I just thought that was a normal thing. This progressed through the years and now my fingers turn completely white, numb, and painful. I did find out this past February (after going to the dr for other symptoms) that I have Raynauds. I just want to say real quick here that I don't normally go to the doctor unless everything I try at home won't work. Three years ago, I had this black circle appear in my vision in my right eye. It was so annoying and lasted two and a half months. The eye had a bit of a yellowish tint to it and what appeared to be a raised area between the iris and the outer corner of my right eye. It also felt like there was something in it. After I freaked out, I called my eye doctor and went in to have it checked. He said he couldn't see anything out of the ordinary and sent me to a specialist. Same response from the specialist and was given eye drops for dry eyes. This went away after two and a half months. I didn't think much of it after that. This past year it has come back a few different times. By searching online I come to find out that it is called a stocoma. My current dr said that the reason the eye doctor and specialist couldn't find anything is because it is neurological. I kept getting sick easy about a year ago and was going to the dr about every three months for the cold, ear infection, and the flu. So my current dr sent me to a rheumatologist and they did some auto immune tests and they came back showing something was going on but still no diagnosis. I was sent home with a rx of vitamin d (which my current dr and I was unhappy with because my vitamin D levels were good). Then I woke up one morning in so much pain in my back last year the I couldn't even get out of bed. I was literally in tears. Had to call my mom to have her take the kids to school for me and come back and take me to the dr. I ended up at a neuro and spine surgeon and two MRIs and xrays later was told I have two degenerative discs (one in my tail bone and one in my neck). Then the nerve pain. I have had what feels like a needle prick in three different places on my head. This has been going on for a couple of years. It starts out as a quick needle prick and then spiderwebs out into a numbing sensation. These are quick and come and go. I have had constant numbness, tingling, and pain since about February of last year. This affects my arms, hands, feet, and legs. It affects my walking. I also have a constant pain going down from the top of my left thigh to the knee on the backside. Was sent for a nerve conduction and after the forth time she shocked me I told her I couldn't go through with it. It felt like sticking your finger in an electrical outlet. It was horrible! I am completely exhausted and tired all of the time. Sometimes to the point it will hit me so fast and all I can do is lay down. I also have insomnia and getting 4 hours of straight sleep is a good day. Then there is the cognitive issues. It started out as being a little forgetful. Sometimes I open the pantry door and find that I had put the milk in there or I open the fridge door and find the bag of sugar in there. I caught myself the other day in the act of putting my dirty dish in the fridge when I was actually going to put it in the dishwasher. This just happens every once in a while. If my kids have something going on like a dance performance they have to remind me everyday up until the day of. Even when it is written on the calendar I keep up in the dining room. I have speech issues. Sometimes I can't find the right word to use (even if it is a common one). I usually describe the item and add the word ""thingy"" after it. Like if I can't think of the word scissors I will say that little hand held cutting thingy. This happens a bit more often than I would like to admit. Some words I say have an extra letter in them that are not supposed to be there. The other day the letter z slipped in a word of one of my sentences. A few years ago, I told my daughter when she was finished eating lunch to through her paper plate in the garbage and her fork in the ""toaster"". I clearly meant the ""sink"". I even knew in my head I was going to say sink but to my surprise the word toaster rolled out of my mouth. When this started it was weird but we all thought it was kind of funny. Happened a few more times over the course of three weeks and then I was fine again. Now I struggle with my words throughout the day. My kids think it is still funny when I struggle to say something and I usually just shrug it off as normal for me now. I don't let them know that it really is frustrating to me. I was diagnosed with vertigo in February and am on Mecklezine now which it does help. I am also on Lyrica for nerve pain. I was on Gabapentin but it seemed to not work. I have been on Lyrica for three weeks now and can actually move more and it has helped so much with my nerve pain. I am truly thankful to have it right now. I also get a tight feeling around my lower rib cage that goes all the way around my back. It feels like a giant snake is wrapped around me and squeezes me so tight. Feels like my insides are being crushed into my spine. The worst one I had woke me up in the middle of the night I ended up in the fetal position in the middle of my bedroom floor in tears for two and a half hours. I get them here and there any time of day. But in the past year I have actually had them during work, which makes things extremely difficult. I also trip over nothing and have a hard time going up stairs. I have fallen three times in the past few years because my right leg from the knee down feels non-existent. There is a few more things but I am going to leave it at that for now. I just feel so frustrated because I have been dealing with the worst of this since last year. It is affecting my work and I have taken off so many days. I am sure they are thinking I am just lazy. I don't want to lose my job. It is a really good one and I worked so hard to get it. I even got a bachelor's degree so it would give me a leg up in the hiring process. But I am falling apart and the doctor's seem to take forever to tell me what is causing all of this. I need a diagnosis and proper paperwork to take into my boss so that they know what is going on. For now I just tell them that if I have to wait for a diagnosis so do they. Which, in all honesty, is not the best thing to say. Without the proper paper work I must look like a lazy person who is making up things. I just don't know where to go from here. I am supposed to be set up with a neurologist and have been waiting for a call from them for two weeks now. I am running out of money for dr's app and they need to figure out what is wrong fast.",Symptoms

It is now Monday the 19th of february and I am still experiencing this numbness and it occasionally spreads to my whole face but then will return to just my left side and can't seem to get my left arm to hang on very well without dropping something or getting it where i need it in time to stop a cabinent door from slamming.

I have been on ultram for many years and it seems to help keep my mind balance and the pain within reason. My regular doctor of many many yrs has retired and I have been feeling like so bullied taking 2 ultrams a day from 4 doctors. Even my primary care that I have been seeing for over a year is telling me the ultram has to go. She also made me give up the few vicodins I got a month when pain broke through. With all this frustration, I now have anxiety. So those meds have also been manipulated away from me. They did piss tests me on for over a year and NO, i am not an addict. So what is working for people who have MS pains plus I have fibromyalgia. I had to go around my doctor, trying to find another doctor and she at last referred me to pain clinic. However, she would not take me on as new patient due to being prescribed ultrams. What is going on?? anybody got a clue. I don't do well with smoking pot. My doctor wants to put me down a rigorous mental medications treatments, and I am so allergic to any anti depressant they have tried me on for the past 20 yrs. I am not chemically depressed, but the anxiety is there at times, but my guess I am feeling bullied and my stability is at risk, which I believe in return, may put me in a tail spin of the MS> I am on no meds, I walk and fight this disease, but feel like I am losing the battle with finding a descent doctor. Even my neurologist is saying well, pain pills are the number 1 problem of opioids in this country. Well, some of us survive on a few pills a day to have a quality of life. Why punish us all that have known issues and quite documented. Any suggestions??",

I was told by three separate MS ""specialists"" that the need for lumbar/spinal taps to determine MS was unnecessary. It appeared - in their opinion - that the gold standard was the MRI results.  Since this was all around 2006, maybe that has changed? However, I don't know that I would put myself through a spinal tap, when I already had the MRI to confirm the MS. Good luck....and don't let the doctors bully you around. If they DO try to bully, it's time for a new neurologist. (IMHO).",Diagnosis

I have not been diagnosed with MS and don't have a family history that I am aware of. However, I seem to have most of the symptoms associated with the disease. My memory is horrible; I can forget what a topic of a conversation was after a small pause and will often forget why I was trying to figure out something in my head, for example this morning I was trying to figure out how much I get paid per day at my job and as soon as I had the simple equation in my mind I forgot why I was doing the math. I remembered after something else slipped my mind in the same way, which I can't remember what it was. I have the worst insomnia. I get tired quickly through physical activity. Taking a shower often takes all the energy out of me and I have to force myself to finish tasks if I have multiple to accomplish. Once I'm done I will be down for the rest of the day. If I get hot I almost immediately feel dizzy and nauseated. I have a headache every day. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and take medication for those. My balance is not the best. I often trip on flat ground because I just don't lift my foot high enough. Along with that I am very clumsy. I run into door jams or tables, as well as other things, because I misjudge the space I have to go between or how sharp of a turn to make. I easily drop things for no reason. My legs easily move when I need to walk and I have no issues moving body parts when I need to. My vision is bad and I wear prescription glasses, although I have had this problem since I was in my teens and most of my relatives also wear glasses. My prescription does get slightly worse every year, however. I will not realize that my, (often left leg/foot) is asleep until after I try to walk on it. My balance is bad, especially when attempting to exercise. (I will lose balance while doing squats despite having arms stretched out and a straight back after 10 or so, for example.) Yoga is very hard solely due to balance. My strength and flexibility is improving through yoga but my balance is where it was day 1. I have a couple things I am not sure are associated but I wonder if could be: I don't have any numbness in my limbs or extremities other than the falling asleep thing described above. However, I have a weird numbing sensation in my back on the left in a very specific location, which sort of feels like a tingling sensation from like a light fabric being repeatedly brushed over the area. Quite a few months ago I had the same sensation on the right side. The last thing I am experiencing has to do with my bladder. I don't have incontinence or accidents. I actually have the opposite problem , I will unequivocally have a full bladder and as soon as I sit on the toilet, I am unable to go. It takes several minutes and when I do, the stream is weak and I have to use all the strength I have to squeeze the urine out of my bladder. During the time I am urinating if I try to just let it flow, I will stop. This is more likely to happen after I have been holding it, or don't have fluids in my system to help ease it along, such as in the middle of the night or first thing in the morning. During the day, as I drink water throughout the day, I easily go, frequently. I'm talking every 30 minutes to an hour for the first half of my day, even if I am just sipping the water. I understand that that, as well as many of the symptoms I described can be associated with many things. I just want to know if the problems with the numbness in my back and emptying my bladder could be associated with MS along with everything else I described. How should I approach my doctor with these symptoms and my suspicions? Could I have just fallen into the rabbit hole when I was trying to figure out why I can't pee and why my back has that weird tingling? Should I wait and see if my symptoms get worse?  Thank you for reading and I appreciate replies. I apologize for length, I wanted to give as much detail as possible.","Symptoms , Diagnosis"

Almost 10 years and several medications later, I don't think this was correct. I've tried it all. Lexapro, Zoloft, Neurontin, Lithium, Risperdal, Trazadone, Seroquel... plus more. Most recently I was on a combination of Lithium 450 2x a day, Zoloft 200 1x a day, Seroquel 400 1x at bedtime, Xanax .5 3x a day, Antabuse 1x a day for alcoholism. Before I started the Antabuse I was drinking and mixing these meds and had 3 seizures so if you are on meds, PLEASE BE CAREFUL! But I recently started taking the Antabuse and had 2 episodes where I was so disoriented and confused I almost went to the ER in fear of a stroke. Turns out to be a negative side effect of the Antabuse. So I am done. I am quitting all these medications and going to a more holistic and herbal approach. The Lithium obviously hasn't helped over the past ten years because I still get so depressed I turn to alcohol and my visits to Rehabs and Psych wards have not slowed or helped. These medications are making things worse as I see it. I failed to mention, when I was diagnosed as Bipolar, I was heavily using cocaine on a daily basis. I have not used any drugs in at least a year and alcohol in 2 weeks. Does anyone have any advice? Herbal supplement suggestions? I am not going to return to the psychiatrist for the simple fact that I leave with more than I started with. Also, even with the medications, I attempted suicide twice... it wasn't a permanent threat, more like a cry for help because I was so ""squirrelly"" inside my head.

More than 2.5 million people is affected across the world. It is a slow progressing autoimmune disease triggered by demyelination of the nerve cells. The disease usually starts when the immune system short circuits and starts attacking the body, particularly, nerve cells or neurons. The immune system releases T-cells which migrate towards nerve cells and cause localized inflammation on the myelin sheaths surrounding the cell. Myelin sheath is a fatty layer around the axon part of neurons that enables neurotransmitters to pass through. Well, I started to search on this after my mother was diagnosed with MS. She was prescribed compound medication from a medication consultation in Toronto(   ), which has been effective on her. The inflammation has reduced. After some research on this, I have come to know that Spirulina is one of the supplements that many MS recovery patients take. It is a strain of edible algae which is specially bred.

It is soft to the touch and not discolored. I can only see it in certain lighting but recently within the past month I have noticed it is pulsing with my heartbeat. I have felt my facial artery and followed it from the mandible and it feels larger on my left than on my right. I have gone to the dermatologist and they said they had never seen anything like that before. I then went to an oral surgeon who suggested I go and get an angiogram CT for the possibility it is a facial AVM. I have been worried about that possibility non stop and I wanted to post this because I have seen other people online post about similar pulsating bumps under the skin about the size of a pea near their mouths and I wanted to start this new thread because all the old ones were closed and didn’t allow me to post or comment. I was wondering if anyone has had a similar situation and if it was an AVM or if it was just that their facial artery was large and close to the surface in a particular area. I am a male and 21 years old so for it to be a facial AVM I feel that I would be diagnosed pretty late considering most AVM’s are formed around birth. I am looking to see if anyone could offer another possible theory on what it is and/or find people with the same condition so I can let you know what the results of my CT angiogram says because no one seems to know what is going on with this pulsing in my face.

My dentist thinks the coldness is because of my grinding....but I haven't expressed that I've felt this sensitivity to cold ever since he filled in my cavity.

I'm sure the grinding has something to do with it, but is that the only thing? Maybe it is since none of the x-rays show anything and I don't feel pain from it.....but it's still hard to eat cold sandwiches or have ice near this tooth....

I was sent to a neurologist, who checked my reflexes in my elbows , knees and said no you don't have MS. He didn't ask if I had any symptoms, at all. Said he didn't really know what I was there for. I told him about the MRI , he said I'll be back I'll go look at it, he was gone 45-60 seconds and said that MRI doesn't look any different from the one I had you do 10 years ago.

While its happening, I hear this one specific song in the back of my head and I keep seeing the same imagery that I did the first time I ever had one of these episodes- but then as soon as it's passed I cannot for the life of me remember what the song was or what I was thinking about. I've tried taking note of when they occur but have never found any consistencies as its happened at all times of day, in public or alone, and in moments where I've been doing completely different things. Sometimes it'll happen several times in a week, then other times weeks have passed before I experience it again. I've thought that I could try writing down what I'm thinking at the moment that the episode happens so I can go back later and evaluate what might be the issue, but the feeling is so overwhelming that I can't bring myself to do anything other than sit still and stare in front of me until it passes.  To go into a little more detail about the episodes themselves- I wouldn't quite describe it as a wave of depression, but more so a rush of anxiety, sadness, and emptiness at once. When I describe it as 'overwhelming' I don't mean it in the sense that it's too much to bear, it's just the ONLY thing that I can feel in the moment and the feelings are so much that I can't describe with words- which has also made it very hard to talk about with my psychiatrist and/or therapist. I kind of feel like I'm in a dream when it happens and the song that I mentioned before almost sounds like its actually playing out loud, but in the other room; my stomach gets queasy, I start to feel overheated, and I'm looking through my own eyes but they're out of focus. I've researched a little about depersonalization and it sounds similar to what I'm experiencing, but I don't think some of the other key elements of that diagnosis apply to me. The most notable aspect of any of these episodes is that its never something new, it's always the SAME things (song & imagery) that come to mind when it happens. In terms of my mental health history, I have been treated for my ADD, Anxiety, Depression, Bipolar Disorder, and PTSD starting at around 12 years old. For a long time I struggled mostly with depression because I often went periods, ranging from hours to days to weeks, where I didn't feel like myself and I didn't find any joy in being alive (not necessarily suicidal, though), but eventually reached the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder because I also have stages where I'm extremely manic and become hyperfocused on whatever it is that consumes me at the time. I am currently 20 and my doctors are primarily focused on my PTSD from a robbery and sexual assault that occurred about 2 years ago, and my Anxiety that worsened when I began having frequent panic attacks in social situations about a year ago. I am taking Lamictal (200MG) right now, and just recently stopped taking Mirtazapine (22.5MG) after being on it for about 8-9 months. I also take 5MG of Dexedrine twice a day for focus. And lastly, my lifestyle- I regularly smoke weed, probably about 1-2 times a day. I am a social-smoker, but I also do it to help me eat or sleep, cope with stress or boredom, or to ease anxiousness when I'm alone; so the amount really just depends on the day. (Note: I have always been sober every time one of these mysterious episodes has occurred). I do not smoke cigarettes, I rarely drink, and I live a relatively healthy lifestyle in terms of diet and exercise. Drug-wise, I have done shrooms twice, coke four times, and LSD 10 times- which brings me to my conclusion. The first time one of my episodes ever occurred- I'm only mentioning this part last because I thought it would be important to know all of the other information beforehand. The first time I ever experienced one of these moments was after coming down from an LSD trip with a friend of mine. Although I do think the LSD played a part in the onset of the first incident, I'm still hesitant to definitively say drugs are completely responsible for what is going on. On the day it happened, my friend and I had both taken only half a tab. I had done acid 9 other times, in the span of 2 years, before this and always took a full tab, so the trip was short and we were both feeling our usual selves within about 6-8 hours. We were sitting on the couch at another friends house approx. 14-15 hours after taking the half tabs when I got the overwhelming feeling I mentioned before- anxiety, depression, and emptiness all at once. I remember listening to music and scrolling down Instagram until I passed over a photo of my ex out at a party posted by someone else, then I felt it. It should also be noted that this ex and I had recently broken off a long-term relationship, so it was a particularly sensitive subject-matter. My mental health had taken a turn for the worst about 6 months earlier (panic attacks, severe depressive episodes, inexplainable episodes of crying, etc.) and as a result, took a toll on our relationship and was ultimately the catalyst that led to the end of things. We had lived together and he kept our puppy after the breakup, so it was not a clean break by any means. However, when this first episode occurred, I had been on the Lamictal and Mirtazapine for a few months and was back in a stable place. About a month passed before I experienced another moment like this one, and then they began to become more frequent later on.  In conclusion, I know that the LSD very well may have been the reason this ever started, even if I wasn't actively tripping when it first occurred. But it's also possible it could be the result something else like stress, other lifestyle choices, medications, etc.. I still haven't been able to characterize it and neither have any of my doctors, so that's why I'm here. Regardless of what the cause might be, what I would love to know is what these episodes are called, and how/if it could be treated. Although they are only 2-5 minutes long, it can be quite debilitating and leave me feeling detached for periods of time afterward. Any advice at all would be much appreciated.

My situation is that I can never ""fall asleep"" normally. I noticed growing up that my brother, cousins, friends, etc., would fall asleep far faster than I could, but it wasn't until college (where I have a roommate) that I realized the full extent of it. I don't think I'd be far off by saying there's not a single time I've dozed off within 2, 3 hours – often, to try and offset the problem, I'll ""go to bed"" as early as 8, but only fall asleep at 2 or so. This has always been an issue, but with stress from school, this has been piling up to unmanageable levels, to where it's totally draining my energy. I always feel tired, bored, unmotivated, and can't focus. I used to be quite an energetic kid, but now I'm just dull and constantly wound up. I've tried quite a bit: relaxation techniques, sleeping masks, candle meditation, melatonin, etc. – but it seems like the harder I try, the worse it gets/the harder it is for me to fall asleep. It's gotten to the point where I only sleep once every 3 to 4 days, and only for a few hours (often, my best nights of sleep are after a night out at a bar). I hope this doesn't sound pathetic or anything, but it's a serious issue. It's not just that I'm having some issues going to sleep – the way my body is functioning just doesn't make sense to me. I don't know how to ""turn my mind off."" And I seriously worry about, long term, what this might mean for my health, especially mentally. If anyone has any advice, or tips, or anything, I'd be grateful. I'm not even opposed to downing sleeping pills at this point, even though the lighter ones I've tried haven't worked. Every time I've voiced concern to my parents, they don't seem to see it as a big issue, and the time I've spoken to a doctor (about a year ago) I received no helpful advice at all.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression , Personality Disorders"

I struggle with depression, suicidal thoughts, and anger ""fits"". And I'm losing. See, my parents don't believe in depression- they think it is something that the weak have. And as a Christian family, they think any illnesses can be truly cured through the act of prayer. I'm not religious, though I can very well fake a good prayer and ace the Bible trivia. I think not being able to confront my parents about who I truly am is part of the problem. I tell them when I get angry, I can't control my yells and fits because it takes me over, and I go numb. Like I can't feel anything but the tears in my face numb. I told them I wanted to see a therapist or a psychiatrist and be professionally diagnosed so I can take the medications I really need. But they tell me to pray. We don't have the financial comfort to go to a professional, so our best option is for me to pray to something I don't believe exists. They tell me if I get angry one more time, they will have to take away any allowances and transportation. I'm really struggling with depression as well as insomnia, and now I'm at a point where I think I have an eating disorder. My mother triggers many episodes of my explosive rage and has been since 2016. I have run away quiet often, and I have once threatened my mother that I will call the cops for child negligence because in all formality, it is true. In a week, I argue with my mother around 5 times. I don't like it and neither does she, but she states change can only happen if I change, not her. She constantly nags that I don't eat enough or at times, I eat too much like a pig. I'm not allowed to state facts or make comments that make her feel small. For example, it is a known fact that salt makes the boiling point higher, thus it will take a slower time for water to boil. She argued that I was wrong, and when I showed her scientific blogs backing my point, she used the same argument that I always had an excuse for me being always right and that I was never going to admit I was wrong. Even today, she accused me of spilling water on a book when I really didn't, but she saw me sitting there and thus, her logic was conclusive. She tells me not to complain, when I tell her that her food was really delicious but slightly salty for my taste buds but ultimately tasty. I left my water bottle in the car, and when I came back from school, it was all banged up and broken. A hydro flask. It had a hole in it. She told me it was because I wasn't thankful for the water our family provides and how I complained about it being lukewarm rather than cold in a previous incident. Even in that fight, I brought the wrong water bottle for a game, so I intentionally left it, telling her I would drink it back at home. She never listens, and she always has reasons why I'm in the wrong. She has outrageous mood swings, and I think she's bipolar, though I'm not a professional so don't take my word for it.  I think about eternal peace, just a life where I'm in the bliss, no fights and no depression. I really don't know if suicide isn't the best option, and I know it isn't, it will get better, but when? How much longer do I have to endure with ignorant parents?","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression , Eating Disorders , Bipolar Disorder"

A couple of weeks after the surgery she began to experience vertigo and eye pain behind her eye, on the same side of her face as the surgery. The pain is worse when she lies on the left side (surgery side). She took two antibiotics and a steroid post-surgery to rule out or prevent infection. She has been to primary care twice, the oral surgeon twice (he says it's not related to the surgery), an ENT twice, ophthalmologist, and is doing vestibular therapy with a PT. She also had an MRI (without contrast) that came back normal. Our next step is an appointment this week with a neuro ophthalmologist, but so far no one has answers. It feels to me like it has something to do with trauma, infection, or healing needed from the oral surgery.

My body is getting worse every year (usually around this season). My mom was diagnosed with MS in the 90's but hers is not progressive. I have seen multiple doctors for multiple things and no one knows what's wrong with me. I'm not a hypochondriac and believe that all of these things are related, not separate problems.  Everything escalated in 2011 when I was diagnosed with optic neuritis. I had just had my son (4th child) in Sept of 2010 before experiencing a 6 month localized headache. After 6 months of suffering from the intense pain in my left eyebrow, I realized I could touch it and trigger the pain in a specific area. My doc gave me a low dose steroid and it went away eventually. Around this time, I began experiencing sensations of water dripping on me...like water dripping on my arm or the top of my foot. I'd go to wipe it and there was nothing there.  2012 began the ""pulling"" searing pain in my neck (down into my back), the tops of my hands and the tops of my feet. At random moments without warning, it feels like an electric shock sensation ""pops"" and is followed by a hot sensation. Sometimes it feels like a tendon gets ""hung up"" and snaps. It's frustrating esp when I'm driving and just ""looking both ways"" or turning to talk to someone. I go through several months with no episodes but typically when they come back, they are frequent, unpredictable and last a few months. That same year, I lost all feeling in my right hand - my pinky, ring finger and half of my palm up through my thumb - which felt like pins and needles half of the time and a dead hand the other. I also started to experience my left hand falling asleep. I could not grip a pencil to even write like normal. I also had a very hard time going down steps because of my knees. My doctor ordered a CAT scan of my head to see if there were legions. It came back mostly clean with the exception of one spot which was inconclusive. I was referred to a neurologist who did nothing for me (he barely spoke to me, just pulled on my arms, banged on my knees and I left). He ruled out MS because I could touch my chin to my chest without triggering any pain. By this point, they decided my hand issues were probably carpal tunnel. The feeling in my hand began to return after a year. For the most part, most of my symptoms were gone.  Come Fall the next year, they returned along with very irregular and heavy menstrual cycles which made me anemic. in 2014 my bladder problems began, along with mild digestive issues. I began getting UTIs quite regularly despite my efforts to avoid them. These moved quite quickly into my kidneys, hospitalizing me with a double kidney infection and potassium deficiency. My doctor ordered a cystoscopy to make sure I was able to completely empty my bladder. Everything came back normal.  At this point, everything began to occur at the same time. The pins and needles in my limbs, twitches and spasms in random places including my face, back, legs, and hands; numbness, bladder infections, stomach problems, shocking sensations, joint pain. Then, they'd subside for months.  Last year, I developed a very stiff neck and sciatica in both my neck and lower back...sometimes at the same time. I thought I had just slept wrong but a year and several chiropractic adjustments later, it's still stiff and painful and I don't have to be doing anything for my sciatica to flare up. My husband and I were in the store one day and my sciatic nerve in my lower back sent a searing sensation that caught me off guard (I wasn't moving, just standing there talking) and my husband caught me as I began to fall. 2016 I began struggling gripping with my hands again. My doc ordered a test for arthritis which was negative. Only days later, I was sitting on the couch when my right thigh and calf muscle cramped immensely causing me to jump up and I couldn't walk...the calf felt like it could have been a blood clot, which scared me and concerned my doc so she ordered an ultrasound of my leg. It came back fine. That September, I was exercising like I always do and 2 days later, both of my wrists felt fractured. My left wrist healing within a few months while my right wrist got worse, sending me yet again to the hospital. Xray showed no break but they couldn't rule out a hairline fracture. My right wrist is still sensitive and requires a brace from time to time, especially while I sleep.  I began getting very sick every time I would eat and became severely constipated regardless of how clean my diet was. I have never struggled with irregularities at all. My doc referred me to a gastro doc who diagnosed me with IBS and introduced me to the FODmap Diet. This diet cuts out fermenting foods to avoid bad gasses in the stomach. This helped but did not correct the constipation or fullness. To this day, everything I eat won't digest properly or break down. I eat no dairy, no gluten, very little sugar or starchy foods and only drink water. I even tried a 15-day colon cleanse vitamin and couldn't use the bathroom at all by day 4 and the cramps were unbearable. This year has been the worst. I now suffer with all of these things plus bladder and bowel issues and can't eat anything without getting sick. Within the past few weeks, my face ""contracts"" (tightens starting in my nose then intensifies over my whole face from my nose upward and subsides) and I can't put my head down too far without experiencing an electric shock sensation shooting down my neck to about the bottom of my shoulder blades. At random moments lately, my whole back tightens and I can't move until it subsides. It feels like an intense ""contraction"". I recently developed neuritis again. My continued menstrual problems led me to an appointment with my gynecologist. She did an ultrasound to find that my uterus is flipped and I have a fibroid tumor which is causing the anemia and heavy bleeding. She said the constipation is a result of my uterus putting pressure on my rectum so she scheduled me a hysterectomy but I am going to cancel it on the advice of my family doctor. He says a uterus cannot cause that kind of restriction. I'm the lead singer of a rock band. On the last 2 shows of tour in September, I forgot my lyrics in the middle of the songs. During both trips, there were bouts where I was trying to talk to friends or fans and knew what I was trying to say but I couldn't get my sentences right or think of some of the words. It became so frustrating that I stopped talking altogether. I had a really rough trip to a particular festival in September. I pretty much stayed in the van all day until we performed that evening. I had a burning sensation in my stomach, couldn't walk a straight line (dizzy, fatigue, loss of balance....but I didn't eat much that day due to stomach upset). I took 6 tums, 2 gas-x pills and an over the counter nausea medicine that day..nothing brought relief. It resolved on it's own after 3 days. Yesterday morning, I woke up feeling like my gut was on fire. I couldn't wait for my husband to come home so I drove myself to the ER. The pain intensified and subsided every 5-10 minutes and made me very nauseous as well as sending a searing pain through my lower right back. This went on for 6 hours and I literally wanted to die...or cut my stomach out! They checked my blood and urine, did an ultrasound of my gallbladder, pancreas, liver and kidneys. Everything came back fine so they concluded that it's probably just the IBS.  My doc is ordering a scope to see my stomach and check for celiac, ulcers, crohn's etc. It very well could be one of these things. I came home from the hospital yesterday and experienced loss of bowel control. I soiled my pants and didn't realize until it was too late. I did the same thing this morning which is why I decided to post here. I'm so embarrassed but desperate for answers. I have been constipated for a year and now I have diarrhea (which could be a side effect of the IBS meds they gave me. But, my doc said it would take 2 weeks to take effect...it had only been 2 days). Obviously I don't WANT a disease of any kind! But I'm tired of going between different specialists to be told there's nothing wrong with me. I want answers so I can start an effective treatment plan.

I'd been taking them for a year and they really helped me but one negative side effect was weight gain. I gained thirty pounds and lost my confidence. I wanted to stop taking them in order to get my weight under control but I hate who I am without them. I hate how I feel and I try to tell myself that it's the illness talking/thinking and not me. As much as I try and tell myself that, those negative thoughts have started taking over again. Everything makes me angry, I dwell on negative interactions that my rational mind knows don't mean anything and I pretty much want nothing to do with any of my so called friends. I get so anxious at having to go to the grocery store or just be out in public. If I don't have my headphones as sort of a buffer between myself and the world, shopping, walking across campus or anything like that makes the pit in my stomach grow into an abyss. I don't want to get back on the meds bc I feel disgusting due to the weight gain. Does anyone have any suggestions? I would greatly appreciate it.

Multiple Sclerosis,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/multiple-sclerosis/7870/could-i-have-ms,Could I have MS?,"Hello... I'm Lisa (46 years old) and I just joined. I'm seeking feedback about my medical issues because I'm beginning to wonder if I might have MS. I went to my doctor in November of 2016 because of stabbing pains in the back of my head (left side). She ordered imaging and the CT and MRI showed a large (2+ inch) lesion in my pituitary. It deforms my optic chiasm and encases arteries, etc., so I was referred to a neurosurgeon. He diagnosed it as an arachnoid cyst and told me it's congenital and I've had for a very long time. It also revealed that I have chiari malformation. Both the cyst and the chiari malformation were noted to be ""incidental findings"" by the neurosurgeon. He contacted my local eye doctor to have a visual field test done, which came back with defects in both eyes but primarily in the right eye. I was also referred to a neurologist for the head pains, which by then had moved to my eyes, forehead and other parts of my head. I was also having stinging in my head (in sort of a helmet distribution) that felt like tiny bee stings. I was diagnosed with occipital and trigeminal neuralgia which I'm currently taking gabapentin for. Because my visual field test was abnormal and because of the large cyst, my local eye doctor scheduled two VEP tests and another visual field test. He wouldn't say anything specific.. only ""I just want to make sure this isn't progressing"". The first VEP showed ""normal"" results but they were unable to get a clear signal on my right eye so the results were less than reliable. I return to my neurologist for a follow-up appointment. I had started having painless spasms in my legs so she ordered an EMG and nerve conduction study. Those were done the same day and showed normal findings so they ruled out ALS and other peripheral nerve possibilities. She was also concerned about my visual field test results. I was referred to another eye doctor who had another visual field test done and my right eye showed even more defects (mostly peripheral). She referred me to a neuro ophthamologist in case the defects are because of the cyst in my head. I have that appointment next month. I returned to my local eye doctor for the next VEP and this time they were able to get a good connection on both eyes (green signal) with two technicians working together. The VEP results were very strange. It showed only a reading for the low contrast on one eye and only high contrast for the other eye but not vice versa. The P100 did not register at all. It says ""P100 not identifed, abnormal VEP response"". The doctor was baffled with the results and said that there might be a latency but it's unclear. The doctor told me to take the printout with me to the neuro opthamolgist in June. I sent the VEP results to my neurosurgeon and my neurolgist. The neurosurgeon said that the VEP is not because of the cyst. The neurologist said, ""The VEP is not related to the conditions you are currently being treated for in our office"". I have a follow-up brain MRI in July to see if the cyst has grown as well as other possible changes. My neurologist scheduled me for three days after the MRI in case of any changes that might affect my treatment. After all of the reading I've done, I'm wondering if I might have MS. I have a shocking jolt (not really painful but uncomfortable) that goes down my spine when I bend my head too far forward (possiblly Lhermitte's sign?). I get extremely tired sometimes and can barely force myself to do basic housework. I might have more energy for a day or so and then I'm exhausted again without warning. I'm having issues with bladder control which began about 2 months ago. I've also had palatal myoclonus for 20+ years. So, with the trigeminal neuralgia, fatique, bladder issues, myoclonus, and possible Lhermitte's sign.... does it seem possible that I have MS? I'm uploading an image of my VEP results and a top view from my MRI showing the large cyst. Any comments would be appreciated. Thanks and God bless!",

Anyway, I saw my pdoc this week and he's advised me to increase the dose of Q back up to 200mg, which I have done, reluctantly. I feel reluctant as the reason we were reducing the dose is because of weight gain - I've gained two stone in the six years I have been on it and just can't get it off, and I am worried about the long-term health implications of this. I am also on lithium, which seems to suit me, but I am disappointed I can't come off Q without a rebound effect.  Maybe another drug alongside the lithium might be the answer?

The therapist said that my older child was too young to know what she was doing . Nothing further was done about it. I didn't think that my young child would remember anything .

I never thought I would be in this situation, ever, but here I am. I thought once it was over I would feel better, like a sense of relief, but I was wrong. The pain has unimaginably gotten worse. The father is there, but he has so much other *** going on regarding his life-threatening brain injury, that he can't be there for me the way I need him to be. So, inevitably I turn to alcohol, because alcohol is always there no matter what. It blurs the pain and makes you feel different from the terrible state you're so desperately trying to escape. It scares me how much I love alcohol- how much i'm relying on it at the moment. I'm desperate for someone's advice/ opinion, which is why i'm reaching out to an online forum. Please.","Depression , Substance Abuse"

During high-school i had to deal with a really sad environment in a poor school filled with drugs, abusing students, no control and unmotivated teachers. My teen years were filled by sad moments where my home was my sanctuary, thus i never felt like leaving it because it meant going back to hell. In the last years of my studies i started having health problems which were rare for my age, but i took everything as something i should just deal with instead of seeking further help. I ended up quitting school on the final year and finishing it on my own from home. 5 years have passed and filled with economic problems, i feel on the edge. I have been stuck in my home being self employed, with no motivation to do anything else with my life.

This first year and the couple of years leading up to my diagnosis have been more than a little challenging but I'm starting to get my bearings.  One of my major symptoms is impaired walking. I can walk without assistance (for now) but sometimes my legs just don't feel like legs. I can't walk far, I can't walk straight, I can't walk very fast and sometimes it's hard to walk at all. I travel for my job and this presents the obvious issues. I recently started taking Ampyra and it seems to be working. My MS specialist told me it works for about 30% of people taking it so I wasn't initially super optimistic but lo and behold, it seems to help me walk notably better but I have some questions that I'd love some perspective on... I take two pills a day approx twelve hours apart. I wonder, though, why I take a pill that helps me walk just before I got to bed and will not be walking very much. Would it make more sense if I took my second dose earlier in the day?  I'm curious if the mechanism 'wears off' (hence the every twelve hours you need your refill) or if this is the kind of drug that builds up and works better over time.  Any thoughts? The drug is super pricey and I'd love it if one pill during the day while I'm working and moving around more would save me some money. However, I'm happy to pay the price to take as instructed for this amazing benefit. Appreciate any perspectives. Thanks!","Living & Managing , Symptoms , Treatment"

I hope that this a judge free zone and that if you guys have any questions, you will ask, it will probably be good for me to talk about it. So for as long as I can remember, I was sexually abused every night up until I was nine. When I finally told somebody about it, my whole family fell apart and I felt like it was my fault. My mom was working three jobs and we were babysat by our grandpa. But he was an alchoholic and was often times passed out on the couch. 9 and 10 year old me had to watch my siblings almost every night. I remember one time, he was drinking and driving, and we almost ran into a tree. After that, I usually only slept in my brothers room. My mom met a guy, his name is Jacob. We moved. They got married, and had a kid. Over the 2 or 3 years that I just passed over, my anxiety slowly got worse. I was waking up with panic attacks and I couldn’t sleep at night. I first started noticing that something was up when my friend took me to New York City, and I wasn’t excited about it at all. I didn’t even realize that I was there, until I had already left. We moved house and I met my best friend braylee. She moved away at the end of the school year, and I had only known her for a couple months. I was grounded all summer, and I was really upset all of the time. I started having frequent panic attacks, and I was severely afraid to sleep. I was afraid that I was going to die in my sleep. The new school year started, and I knew that something was wrong with me. I just wasn’t ever myself. As the school year has gone on, my depression has gotten worse. Many things have happened that you can read about in my next post, but I felt myself hit the bottom of a pit. I honestly want to die sometimes. I want the pain to stop. And the constant judgement to stop. I feel worthless, and sad all the time. There’s this voice in my head and I can’t get it out. Many thing scare me and give me anxiety.

A little over three weeks ago, my right leg went numb below the knee and I started to get pins and needles in the feet and cramps in the calf. I also had a dull pain behind my left eye and very slight shaking (kind of like my whole body was on vibrate but barely noticeable to me). The pins and needles, numbness and cramps started to migrate to the left feet and calves over the next two days. The afternoon I had a really sharp pain on the right side of my neck of 30 minutes (glosseal neuralgia?) Then it went away. This happened at the same time the following two days for exactly the same time period. I haven't had that since. Then I started to get a little tingling and pins and needles in my hands and twitching in my legs and extreme FATIGUE. It felt like my legs couldn't support me. I also started to get pin pr!ck sensations all over my body but mostly below the waist. Over a few days, the twitching got a little and pin pricks got worse and my right leg and arm felt like it was sunburned, which it wasn't. The sun burn lasted a day . A couple of days later, still having tingling, cramping, twitching, and pin pricks, my right side felt like it was literally on fire. That lasted a day. About a week has past and it felt like my symptoms were very gradually decreasing and them wammmo! Yesterday morning I had severe pain on my left scapula whenever I turn or bend my head left or lift something with my right arm. My buddy did a little acupuncture and the pain went away. I also started getting electric shock sensations on my head all over but mostly on the sides and behind my ears. Today, I had very sharp pains below my calf to my heel that lasted for a second and continued for several hours, intermittently. This is really starting to freak me out.

And thanks for the opportunity to candidly vent here. It may ramble at times, but I need to let it out, and hope for advice/info. From a young age, around 3 or 4, I could tell something was not quite right about my family. A lot of secrecy, and just a feeling of heaviness and tension, always being present in the house. Plenty of fighting, as well.  I remember being afraid of my father and sister, and not protected by my mother. My brother and I were closer than the others, but still, at a ""distance"". Not normal, even in dysfunctional circles. For most of my life, I intentionally, and probably subconsciously, buried those memories.  I've had no intimate relationships. Ever. In all my adult years, I have always been drawn to horrible people, who I believed were all I deserved. Clearly, I had gotten what I deserved each time.  I've been lonely, alone, and sad for decades, and have become accustomed to it. That was until 5 years ago, when I was almost 48 years old. My life changed forever. That was when my mother decided it was time to tell me about my family. Things I didn't need to know. She told me out of guilt, and a way to clean her conscious. As a result, it has polluted my existence.  For 5 years, I have been walking around with this - the knowledge of what my family was/is, and the realization of the profound betrayal. It was always something I knew about, but her selfishness made my assumptions all too real, and I will hate my mother for it. My life is spiraling out of control, with no end in sight. There is so much more to this, and I have no where to turn. I have made mistakes, and have used poor judgement, on several occasions, which have ultimately damaged my life. On top of it all, in August, I lost my full time and part time jobs, within 5 days of each other. The mere thought of having to start over again, has me both afraid and disgusted. I literally have nothing.  If anyone can recommend anything, I welcome it. I am set to turn 53 years old, and my options are limited.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Abuse Victims , Depression"

And the fact that I have Medicaid, I don't work, I don't contribute to society, I have no family. when someone has something like this it's very scary, painful, and with the emotional part of it a person can become overwhelmed, disgusted, and more depressed then anyone can imagine. Self esteem, there's none. What is that? I go no where. I can't have any sort of normalcy in any aspect of my life. I live in seclusion. It's CONTAGEOUS for Gods sake! I'm tired of fighting for my life when no one believes me. I need to have these false Dx's stricken from my medical record and I don't know how that's going to happen, but its keeping me from getting any help. It's so bad that I have cysts throughout my entire body. They hurt. You can feel them just under my skin.3 I nicked my big toe while shaving and I'm not exaggerating, a 12 inch worm came out. I have a photo of it but it does me no good. They say ""I don't know what that is! "" but anyone can see exactly what it is. You can see the structures of its body. ITS INCREDIBLY HORRIBLE. The only tests these Dr's have done are the O&P still test. I've taken 4 of these tests. All negative. All mortifying each and every test. The O&P test ONLY detects 4 different species of parasitic worms, and on top of that it's only 30% to 70% accurate. .. I have no idea what it was that popped into my mouth all I know is I'm deathly Ill. I'm becoming crippled and can't walk very well because of the swelling and pain in my feet. The pain is ridiculous, yet I can't even get a PCP to take me as a patient because when they look me up in their computer they've got me red flagged. I need help In a serious way. IDK what to do anymore. I can't take these ER Dr's turning me away again and again. I need a PCP. I need surgery to remove the parasities from inside my body, it hurts very badly... I need some serious IV Antibiotics for several weeks most likely. My lungs are really awful. They tell me I have lung nodules, but yet they don't do anything for me. What are these nodules? They're the worms. Which I'm coughing up all day long.   It's THAT BAD! CAN ANYONE GIVE ME ANY ADVISE because I'm loosing this battle rapidly.",

I was a member of this board about 5 years ago when I had a bout of optical neuritis and a ton of really weird things going on. I was drifting while I was running and had a bunch of tingly sensations among other things. I went to a neurologist, who basically made me feel like I was a crazy woman approaching perimenopause. I cried. I thought I had the answer to what was going on and my husband even wrote me off as some sort of hypochondriac. Fast forward five years and I start having really weird neck and shoulder pain. It doesn’t feel like any normal pain, mostly because it hurts the most at night. So I go to a chiropractor, because that’s what you do when you have neck pain. He’s got me coming in three times a week and he’s adjusting away, and I get no relief. So he sets me up for an MRI and we decide I should see an Ortho. We are thinking degenerative discs or arthritis. I go for the MRI and the tech says my chiro will have results in 24 hours, and I wait. I wait and wait and wait… through 10 days and a phone call, NOTHING. So I call the imaging center and get the results myself. I laughed at first when I read the report. Plaques in my cervical spine that were not there before. The radiologist’s indication was…MS. BTW my chiro has still not called. I’m mad at him.  First I laughed, I really did… because now I know I am not crazy (and I can prove to my husband I am not) but then I cried. Because now I don’t know what to do. What’s next? I don’t have a regular Dr. because mine moved away. I don’t want to go back to the neurologist that made me feel like an idiot. I am so confused.

The pain went away so I stopped checking the tonsil node for its size.A few months ago I began having dry mouth and ear pressure.

No pain this time though. I saw that my tonsils had crater-looking sores with white spots in the middle. The doctor saw them and gave me antibiotics and tested me. I came up positive for Herpes type 1. When I went to a specialist he seemed to not be very worried either and said to just come back to see him.About 2 week's later after taking loads of antibiotics I've noticed what appears to me ulcers in the back of my throat. The white spots on my tonsils are gone but the craters remain and my right node is less inflamed but my left node is just as inflamed as when I started.

My daughter is a freshman at a large university. She has always been what I called ""high strung"" and very emotional. In high school she was dealing with a lot of changes. For most of her first year she was very anxious and became depressed. Then she began having problems with eating. After the first year of hs, her anxiety improved but She developed an eating disorder. By her junior year she was diagnosed with EDNOS (Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified) and Anxiety. She worked hard with a therapist and nutritionist to get her life on track with great results. Fastforward to this year. She began college in September. One of the reasons we chose the university was the availability of mental health and eating disorder counseling. Her therapist thought she would benefit from living on campus to begin to be independent from us. She was so excited to go away, did not want to live at home and commute. She has been a MESS. Several full blown panic attacks. MANY crying phone calls. Several visits to campus to see her. She went to mental health clinic 4 weeks ago and so far no therapy, they are going to outsource her to an off campus dr which gives her more stress not knowing how she is going to get there. They did provide her with a small group class in calmness. Her grades are suffering. She loves college and hates it at the same time. There are many things she enjoys and has made a lot of new friends. When she comes home to visit she cry about going back. Hopefully she will begin therapy soon. So far, none of the eating behaviors have come but so much anxiety. Has anyone else dealt with anxiety in college either as a parent or student? How do you help someone you love who is in pain????

My dentist said that the filling cracked, so he replaced it. This was a few weeks ago. Despite having it adjusted 3 times, it has still been bothering me. It's not pain really, but discomfort, like a popcorn kernel is lodged there or something, and also sometimes sensitive to cold. Flossing does not bother me, and chewing and brushing my teeth actually make it feel better for a while. Ibuprofen does very little to help. They did an xray and said it looks fine, not abscessed, which makes sense I think, since it really doesn't hurt, but I'm still not adjusting to it after a few weeks, and the unrelenting discomfort is a struggle at times. The dentist says that I grind my teeth and thinks this may be the problem, so I had a bite plate started last week that I'm waiting on. This makes sense, as I have some other spots in my mouth, mainly bottom just left of center, that bother me on and off, which my dentist also thinks is grinding related. I've been using a store bought night guard for over a week while I wait, but haven't noticed any improvement anywhere, and the discomfort in the filling doesn't really feel grinding related to me. My only thought is that 9 years ago I had a filling done that bothered me. The dentist switched it from white to silver, saying I might deal with that better, and as I recall, I did. However when I mentioned that this time, he said that white composite has improved and that shouldn't be an issue.  Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated. I'm considering seeing another dentist for a second opinion but it's hard to know where to begin, and I feel sometimes like my mouth will never feel normal again. Thanks,  Matt",

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/68301/long-term-effects-of-sertraline,Long term effects of Sertraline,"For the past 12 years or so, I have been taking 100mg of Sertraline per day. In the beginning, it used to be due to a small case of OCD, but later on, it was due to fear that stopping it might affect my studies. I recently stopped it, around 3 weeks ago. And a couple of days afterward, I started experiencing some serious nausea and dizziness. If I move my head in a different direction, or decide to look somewhere else, I will get this sudden dizziness, which will almost immediately go away, but a mild feeling of wanting to vomit will remain throughout the day. The same dizziness seems to appear if I suddenly see a bright light. All these symptoms make day to day work impossible, and even lying down it bed can be nauseating. The doctor who prescribed the Setraline back in the day advised me to go back to the medication, but another doctor suggests that it could just be an ear infection, and prescribed Stemetil to help relieve the dizziness. It barely helps. Has anyone else taken Sertraline for long periods of time and suffered from issues after stopping it? Are there any recorded withdrawal symptoms associated with Sertraline. I wish to know because even if I do start taking Sertraline again just to get rid of the dizziness now, how much longer will I have to take it?",

Up until a week ago I was a very happy go lucky, everything going for him, glass half full type of guy. Im a server so I work in a very fast paced and stressful environment. It all started on a busier night, I was taking a tables order when I felt my body become very warm and my hearing started to go out, like turning down the volume on a TV, I felt like I was going to pass out and quickly rushed through the process. Once I got through it I felt better but for the rest of that night I felt like I was living in a dream.  The next few days I go to work and still feel the same, I'm able to work but I feel like I'm not myself. I start to experience some anxiety and feel an emptiness in my stomach. I dealt with the same stomach feeling in childhood but I've never been an anxious person. So finally I talk to my manager one night and tell him that I'm too anxious to converse with people.  Fast forward a few days later and a few more missed shifts. Im laying on the couch with my Girlfriend and start to get very in my head with negative thoughts like ""What will you do if you can't go back to work"" ""What if you can't talk to strangers anymore."" Which results in a full blown mental breakdown and a Panic Attack.  So I miss a few more days of work trying to recover from the after effects of the Panic Attack. Which just amplified my feelings of the dream state I talked about prior, I think the medical term being De- Realization, the feeling of emptiness in my stomach and general anxiety. I've been talking to family, friends, and just about anyone who can relate to how I'm feeling. I have also taken out sugar, stimulants, and strive to get outside and workout daily.  Today I decided that enough was enough and headed back to work. However the dream state was almost unbearable and when I tried to greet a table I felt an overwhelming feeling of nervousness that made my limbs feel like Jello. So I get sent home again and feel like I'm back at square one, with my mind one negative thought away from having a Panic Attack all over again.  So my question for you all is how do I get over this? I've done so much research and watched countless videos, some talk about getting blood work done, others say to see a Psychiatrist, most people from my support group just say it takes time. I'm beyond lost and this entire situation has blindsided me.  Thanks -Corey",Anxiety & Panic Disorders
Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/68044/what-is-this,What is this,"Hi I'm Gaby and I'm 15. Honestly I've been feeling this way for a while and needed to let it all out. A few years ago I was sad and to this day now I still feel that way so I said to myself that I was depressed. In class when I have to speak in front of my class or even just one person I don't know I get so nervous; my breathing becomes irregular, my hands start to shake, my heart starts beating so fast and I find it so hard to function. Along with that I also get extremely angry and rage out at people who come my way. Usually I have my burst out and get mad at every little thing but when I've calmed down I reflect on what just happened and think to myself, ""Did I seriously do that?"". About 1-2 years ago I also began to isolate myself from others, I think I got fed up with the people around me and decided to not involve myself with them. Recently I haven't been feeling anything; it's rare. Of course I feel but I bottle it all up because I have this thought in my head that if I feel, I'll be considered a little ***. But if there is a possibility that I do let it all out I usually go over the top if that makes any sense. Another thing that has been happening recently is that I have some nights where I get no sleep at all or I oversleep. Yesterday when I got home from school(2:00 p.m) I went straight to bed and didn't wake up till today at 6 because of school but if i didn't have classes today I'm pretty sure I would've woken up later on just like it happened a few days ago. Sometimes in school I feel that it's difficult for me to concentrate or to even remember what I was taught. At other times I ramble on my words so much I don't even know what I'm saying. There are also some other things going on in my head. I kind of have these voices in my head, like in the cartoons when they have the angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other. In certain situations like decision making or something I hear one of them telling me to do the right thing and the other telling me to the the wrong thing and then there's me, I contemplate on what I should do but most of the time I end up doing the right thing. Another thing is that recently I've been hearing and seeing things that are not there when I check again, it's so weird because I swear on my life what I saw or heard was true. I honestly don't know what's going on with me and it's been happening for quite a while. I know only a professional can diagnose me with something but does anyone have an idea on what I might be?",
Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/68585/end-of-my-rope,End of my rope,"HI. I am going to pour my heart out here because I don't know what else to do.  5 years ago I was lively, hopeful, I worked, I had friends, and I loved life I was diagnosed as Bipolar decades ago but I went on and off medication with little notice. I had control issues but I got through life pretty unscathed. Please understand that what I am about to say is horrible and I am ashamed of it but I need to say it to someone.  5 years ago I also got pregnant. I was not about to have a baby at 35 after raising my kids since I was 16. Texas has some *** up abortion laws. The process is expensive and the force you to have a transvaginal uttrasound and give you 24 hour to “think about it” before you can have an abortion.  While researching online I found a women’s group that sold the abortion pill and after a few unsuccessful attempts at ending the pregnancy myself ( taking high doses of vitamin C and hot baths) I ordered the pills. The doctor thought it might have originally been twins but one had absorbed the other and perhaps the other fetus was a molar pregnancy ( either the sperm or egg was blank with no DNA so not a baby) They did an ultra sound at 9 weeks and noticed a blood clot. When the pills arrived I waited until our day off and took them. I saw the baby come out. Well, I saw bones. I put them in a bag and came out of the bathroom shaking.  I remember that Comfortably Numb was playing on the radio. I was alone in the room and I cried. For the first time I realized I killed a baby. I didn’t regret my decision but its different when you are a part of whats going on instead of lying back and letting a doctor do it.  Then the bleeding started. Everything went ok at first but after a while I started to bleed heavily. The package said I would bleed so I rode it out.  Until I passed out. I would pass out 2 more times before I told Billy to call an ambulance. When I got to the hospital I had to have 2 units of blood. Eventually they found tissue in my cervix that was not allowing it to close. I was in the hospital for 2 days.  It has stayed with me and haunted me since then. Everything seemed to go down hill after that. I didn’t want to be around people anymore. I never told anyone what happened and I felt that people would hate me if I did. I has an abortion before but this was different. I ended it myself and it was violent. And I did that. Not a medical procedure. Me. And it tore me up. I just didn’t realize how much for a while.  This is when everything started to fall apart.  I didn't want to be around people, I alienated all my friends. I started isolating myself and missing work until I lost the job I had had for 5 years, and then the job after that, and the one after that. It has steadily gotten worse and worse.  In March I had a break down and was hospitalized. Seeing the doctor there I was told that she believed I had major depressive disorder. I was glad at first because I thought that FINALLY I was going to be able to feel normal again. It never happened and I am more depressed now than ever.  My youngest child is 16 and she moved out to live with her father because the University she wants to attend is near him... 2500 miles away from me.  My mother has been bed ridden for almost 2 years after failed mesh from a hernia surgery has cost her her stomach and has just recently had reconstructive surgery but is still a long way away from getting better. As a matter of fact, we live each day worried about leaks, and bleeding and infection that might cost her her life.  My father has heart problems and in the midst of all the problems my mother is having, had to have triple bypass.  about a year and a half ago we were offered a house for rent by my brother in law and right in the bog middle of all of the family crisis, he decides he wants to sell the house and gave us 3 months to pack up and get out.  That was all I could take an I just snapped.  I was at work when my brother in law gave me the news and I lost it. I drove to my parents house to get a gun. My mom was in the hospital and dad was with her. When I got there the key to the guns was not where it usually was. In desperation I started tearing apart drawers trying to find it. After about 10 minutes I look up and see the damage I have down looking for it and I realized what I was doing and called for help.  After the hospital I had to stop working which has put us in hard times financially so a month ago I went back to the same job, working at a pet store but I am not a manager anymore and I only work 20 hours a week to try to keep my stress levels down but even now I get up 4 hours before I go in at 8am because I have to cry, and throw up several times before I can talk myself into leaving the house, alone, for 4 freaking hours. I can't handle 4 hours and that makes me feel like a failure. This has also made it really hard for me to see the doctor and get my meds because of the cost. I manage them but I have nothing left over to see a therapist so I ride out each day waiting for it to end and go to bed every night hoping that tomorrow will be the day I start building my life again but that day never comes. I've tried all kinds of scripts, Supplements, Medical Cannabis, CBD, nothing has worked and sometimes I don't know if I am depressed or if my life is just overwhelming and it's normal to feel this way.  I wish I was dead every single day.  I am trying to get disability hoping that it will afford me the time and money to throw myself into getting better. I guess I want to know how you cope? I have no drive, no ambition, no will to go on. How do I make it go away?","Depression , Self Harm"

Through this we lost our home and we are currently battling our old land Lord who is trying to take advantage of us for more money. We are currently back home with family.  Just this past year my family had been helping with the severe health problems of my grandmother - who had ended up in the hospital for the majority of the year. It wasn't an easy thing to see my best friend unconscious on a hospital bed anticipating that she might leave me at any moment. I'm sure most of everyone can fathom this situation, because it is not all that uncommon. When comes financial and medical stress, relationship problems follow. It came to the point where I wasn't performing my full potential at my job, and the overstimulation from anxiety and racing thoughts was keeping me in bed until late hours on my days off.  Luckily I found therapy in my job - working with animals. Most nights I would stay late to provide extra care for the animals, which I truly see a blessing.  I found myself staying particularly late one night - I laid down in a kennel with a dog that I sensed needed some compassion and began brushing her and helping her fall asleep. I then got a call. The kind that knots your stomach. These phone calls don't require any indication of topic or specific details, just the ""are you sitting down"" and the deep sigh from the other end. I rushed to my parents house and demanded to know what was wrong as soon as I entered the house. My parents are my best friends - we have always been a bullet vest kind of family, no matter what we stand up to the challenges together. This one was a lot harder. My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer.  I could go into the gut wrenching detail of the emotions that were to follow; and the days of lying in bed listening to music that reminded me of my childhood but it all comes down to the same thing. They say that you're only given as much as you can handle... I don't know if that's true anymore. Is that just something people tell themselves when life becomes something you read in a fictional novel that gets the tears jerking? All I can say is I don't know, but I'm going to try to be the strongest yet for the most important woman in my life; even if that's something I cannot do for myself.",Depression

I have been tapering for 6 months and have .25mg a day left which I take before bed and when I wake up. My symptoms are generally mild compared to other stories but the fear and anxiety is what slows down my tapering speed. I know some of the symptoms are made worse by the anxiety I create on top of the actual symptoms. I know heart rate increased during withdrawal so my question is can I monitor my withdrawal symptoms by checking my rate. For instance if my usual rate is 70bpm normally can I use this as an indicator to know whether or not my body is withdrawing more. So if my heart rate is normal would it be safe to say I am generally ok to continue tapering that day. I just need help to know there is some kind of baseline to distinguish real symptoms from what I create out of my own fear. Thanks.,"Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Substance Abuse"

I'm a 39 year old male who has been dealing with some serious health issues since 2013. That's when I found out I had severe diabetes and found out at the hospital. I went on because I thought I had the flu. I found out there that I had diabetes and had some gangrene. The ER doctor told me I had 2 days left to live. I was admitted and had 7 major surgeries in 11 days saved my life. I was hospitalized for 33 days. I came home and had to relearn how to walk again. Moving forward to 2016 and I again had gangrene in my foot. I ended up with MRSA and an amputation below my knee. 2015 I went blind in my left eye and contracted Chronic kidney disease. This year in April I got really sick. I went to the hospital and was told that I had a heart attack sometime in the past. I didn't know it or felt it. I was sent to a different hospital that had a great cardiologist there. I found out there that I had to have a triple bypass surgery. I went through that and they cleared out 97% of the blockage. I live alone so they thought I would be better off in a nursing home and rehab center. The surgeon sent me there 5 days after the surgery. I was at the nursing home for about 5 days and went into heart failure. I was rushed back into the hospital and had to take a few dialysis treatments because I had went into renal failure. They gave me 2 blood transfusions. I was sent back to the nursing home to restart my physical therapy. Altogether I was gone from home for 5 months. I've been having nightmares every night about surgeries and dying. It has made me to the point I'm scared of going to the doctor's office or the hospital for anything.

It's a common issue, and there are several strategies to improve both speech and swallowing difficulties. Speech MS can cause a couple different vocal issues. Dysarthria is slow, slurred, or quiet speech that is a result of poor or limited articulation. Dysphonia causes your voice change making it sound harsh, hoarse, overly nasal, or breathy. Most people take the ability to talk for granted, which can make it seem like a fairly straightforward task. However, speaking requires 100 different chest, neck, jaw, and facial muscles to work in synch. If the nerves to any of these muscle groups, or the movement of the vocal cords are affected by MS you may not be able to speak as eloquently as you once could. In most cases an evaluation by a Speech Language Pathologist (SLP) is recommended, and can be extremely helpful. They can take a careful look at how all those muscles are moving and your breath control. Then, just like a physical therapist, they can suggest exercises to strengthen the muscles that control speech.  Swallowing The same muscles that you use when you speak are also responsible for swallowing. Difficulty with initiating a swallow, choking, coughing while eating or drinking, or frequently clearing your throat during meals can be warning signs of a swallowing disorder (dysphagia). This is a potentially life-threatening issue because it can lead to choking, or even aspiration pneumonia. If you think you are experiencing dysphagia you should bring it to the attention of your neurologist immediately, and once again they will probably recommend an evaluation by a Speech Language Pathologist (SLP). Your therapist can do a couple of diagnostic tests to pinpoint your issue, and come up with a personalized treatment plan. There are several strategies for managing dysphagia such as slightly tucking your chin, alternating a bites of food with sips of liquid, and swallowing each bite twice can greatly reduce the risk of choking. Therapists can also recommend the right amount and consistency for food and liquids for you. It is also important to always eat and drink while sitting straight up, keep your tongue and teeth as clean as possible to reduce the bacteria in your mouth, and to take a break if you feel fatigued at mealtime.","Living & Managing , Symptoms"

Eventually the tooth died and broke apart a piece at a time, that I would usually spit out while eating. I never thought much of it as there was no pain associated with it. The roots did remain in my gum and my dentist urged me on multiple occasions to have it extracted, which I ignored. The other day I noticed what felt like a kernel of corn in the void where my molar used to be. I happened to notice it the night I had some corn with dinner and figured that's what it was. I couldn't push it out withmy tongue like i normally would with food particles in the past so today I took a tooth pick to it and discovered it was not a kernel of corn but instead a small white soft growth or sac. It appeared to have some kind of clear pus type of liquid in it similar to a blister. My gum bled pretty good for about 5 minutes at most and has since stopped with again no pain. I'm a little nervous as to what it was and was hoping for some insight. Thanks!!","Mouth Problems , Tooth Problems"

The issues we have at home and the issues at school are completely different. He has been at this school for 4 days and they have him a low dose of Risperdal stating it is only to calm him and thwart the aggressive tendencies. I am extremely apprehensive about this medication as it is an antipsychotic. I realize that this medicine is used in an array of patients for several different diagnosis. His stepfather is a nurse and has reassured me this dosage is the equivalent to him taking a bit of melatonin. But I still feel uneasy. He's not been formally diagnosed with anything as of yet.

However, the points I did mention should be enough to help you find a quality anti aging skin care product. Instead, what you should look out for are such natural ingredients that stimulate the natural production of collagen and elastin in your body. Some things increase the free radicals in your body, for example pollution, smoking, alcohol, fast food and even emotional stress could cause it. According to dermatologists, over-cleaning the face causes more problems than under-cleaning it. It's easy to be mislead by testimonials that may be slanted one way or another, because of what the company wants you to hear. As you get older, you lose the production of this precious protein and your skin will start to show it in wrinkling and age spots. And certainly having an optimistic outlook anti aging can be helpful. They never have any limit over their eating behavior and do not exercise.

I know that alcohol is not too good for my health either, so I was wondering, can I drink alcohol if I have MS? A: In general having MS doesn't necessarily mean you can't drink alcohol. However, it is very important to talk to your doctor if you are unsure! Alcohol can interact with a number of medications that we take for symptom management, like muscle relaxers, steroids, and pain medication. It can also make some of your symptoms worse because it acts on the central nervous system, so if you have difficulties with speech or balance you may notice that they are worse after drinking. The key is moderation, and because MS affects all of us differently you should focus on doing what's best for you!",Living & Managing

Mental illness does run in my family (two suicides in recent generations) and I've always struggled with self esteem and self worth because of my childhood. I had a mother who was cold and unemotional and never stood up for me with my older siblings who ganged up on me most of my youth. I had an amazing dad who I lost when I was only 20. I was raised in the church and believed that suicide was an unforgivable sin; otherwise, I guarantee you, I'd have ended things in my teens.  I'm the mother of three incredible young men who are pretty much grown and don't need me anymore. I'm married to a man who I always thought was my soulmate, but who has a drinking problem that he can't quit. We also have issues with his adult son who is a drug addict and has cost us both thousands of dollars over the years. I have tried to get my husband to quit drinking. He'll admit he has a problem and cut back for a while and things will be decent, but then he'll ramp it back up again to the point where it disrupts my sleep the way he flails and twitches in bed and snores like you have no idea. It also turns him into an obnoxious kid, even though he's fifty. And when I call him on it, he can turn mean. Not physically abusive, but he'll yell and slam things.  I've been feeling emotionally weaker the past few years, likely from dealing with the physical pain of my jobs for the last 25 years. When things go south with him, I feel like nothing will ever get better. I either want to take off to parts unknown and leave everyone behind (except my children, who are the only thing that keep me here). I feel hopeless.

Multiple Sclerosis,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/multiple-sclerosis/155/question-about-the-neuro-exam,Question about the Neuro Exam,"I received this question from a user on the old WebMD platform: Q: I am not dx with anything (I didn't see a Neurology forum however) I have had random neurological symptoms for more than 15 years. In April I got up one morning and instead of getting up like normal my body veered to the right, I then went on to experience vertigo like symptoms for some time. It got better for a few weeks and then came back. I couldn't walk strait to save my life. LOL especially first thing in the morning. My PCP sent me to ENT, then a cardiologist, and now to the Neurologist. I had my apt on Monday. *side note, I have had other symptoms as well such as weakness in arms and legs and numbness in hands and left leg. I have had tingling and a tremor (which I have had once in the past only on the other hand) my legs feel like Jello and the muscles feel so tired.* OK my question is. Is it typical for a neurologist after completing the exam to not say one way or another how I did? what was normal, what was not?? Because this doctor didn't say a word. This is bugging me now. I mean because I know some of the things weren't normal. But he didn't elaborate or explain. Like for example my reflexes. I am not sure how all the others were, but when it came to my left leg it was VERY hyper reflexive....It scared me HA! he bopped my knee and my knee shot up like a high kick! That ""can't"" be normal ... right? Also I could not walk on my heels at all. Those were the only two things that I know of. I don't understand the results of anything else.  He did order an MRI and a EMG so maybe that should tell me something. But he did say that the balance problems and dizziness was just vertigo, which confused me. *sigh* UGH! I am so frustrated!!! A: I know from firsthand experience that searching for a diagnosis is extremely frustrating, so I'm sorry you have to go through this! In all likelihood he didn't explain what was abnormal because in neurology it is very difficult to say before seeing test results. We use the neuro exam as an initial screening, and if something seems abnormal it helps us decide what tests to order so that we can get to the bottom of things. I'm hoping you will get some answers after you have your MRI and EMG done, hang in there! In the meantime, you might find this article on the neuro exam helpful:",Diagnosis

Recently I have had severe left side trigeminal migraines, runny nose (left side only), funny feeling on the left side of my face, slight incontinence, extremely restless legs at night, shaking after gardening or other similar exertion.  My long term symptoms are tingling in both arms from the elbow down, fatuige in arms where I can't hang out washing or wash my hair, falling into a comatose type sleep most afternoons. Vertiogo, dizziness, nausea.....These are just a few.....  Recent MRI shows small punctate periventricular white matter hyperintensities in keeping with non-specific foci of demylenation.  Psychiatrist sent me for EEG strobe light test for possible light triggered epilepsy. Had that two days ago.  Dr referred me to neurologist but because of where I live there is a 2 to 8 month wait list depending on the emergency status of your results.  Unfortunately I am studying to be a medical scientist majoring in Pathology so I just knew what the latest MRI results could mean.  I honestly thought my MRI would be clear, the one two years ago only had one small calcification that was of no concern, I don't know what question I want to ask, I think I am numb and all my symptoms can also be related to possible Lupus or other autoimmune conditions but my gut keeps telling me it IS multiple sclerosis and I can't stop the thought popping into my head.  So what do I do while I wait for the neurologist appointment?  Every time I drop a cup, spill something, trip over something, I can't help but have my heart skip a beat and this happens multiple times a day now.

I wanted to and would have kept working longer if not for being laid off. I was seeking part time employment and was offered a position of 20 hours per week. I was unable to accept this position as I just found out that I am going to need hip replacement surgery and it is scheduled for September. This position was just seasonal from July thru January and I really wanted to work but could not in good faith start working and then telling the employer that I needed to have surgery. It took me so long to find a position. I asked the surgeon if I cold put it off for 6 months but he stated that it was not a good idea. When I told this employer that I was unable to take the position and why I was told to call them when I am recovered as they were really interested in hiring me. I am terrified to have this surgery as I am so afraid that I am going to due during surgery or have some complications, but I need to have this surgery so that I can walk again and enjoy life as right now I use a cane to get around and am told that this surgery will make me totally functioning again. I have been reading online about this surgery and the reviews from people who have gone through this procedure and some are good and some are bad and this is not helping me at all. I am so stressed out and worried about our financial situation as we really could have used the extra income as it is so difficult living on a fixed income and my husband and myself are not that well off. Also my husband has bypass surgery this past January and he has recovered very well but I still worry about him. Then we lost several thousand of dollars in one of our investments due to miss-management and there is a class action lawsuit that is pending. Then we had an issue with the IRS and had to obtain a tax accountant to handle for us. It is just one thing after another and it never seems to end and I have a history of depression and all of this has not helped one bit and I just have so much anxiety and cannot stop obsessing about this surgery. My husband was going to start looking for part time work but now with what is happening with me it will be hard for him to work right now as I am going to need some care for awhile. my dad is 90 and is in assisted living and I go there every Saturday and bring him personal items that he needs and also handle his finances as I am his POA along with taking him to all of his various doctors appointments. My sister lives in Florida and my brother is here in Cleveland but he works full time however even when I was till working full time I had to totally handle all of my Dad's needs, so once I have my surgery and am recovering it will be a while before I can help him once again, so it is going to be on my husband's shoulders to take care of my dad which is unfair to him even though he is very helpful and supportive to me and my Dad. I am just so very overwhelmed but all that has happened so far and what is yet to come. I really don't have any close friend that I can talk to and right now cannot afford counseling.

I went to hospital twice because I was a mess and at that time I was stressed to the max. Shaking so bad etc. They diagnosed me with GAD and Panic disorder. They gave me Ativan and sent me home. A few days later I experienced a shocking visit from someone and it seems to have triggered everything else. All my life I have been stressed. I was a very abused child, surprised I survived it. I was gang raped at 12 in Canada, I was sexually assaulted by a family friend. Then I was married off by my parents and that was a very abusive relationship. Very bad. I had 2 children with him. He beat me, put me in hospital and took off. Never to see them again. I have tried. With no luck to find them. I went through cervical cancer on my own with husband in field because he was in military. Survived that. Remarried. Husband not like he was before he went to Desert Storm and dealing with all of his stuff. Very hard. Treats me like a child and telling me how to act etc. Gets on my nerves. Not happy. Raising our Granddaughter. That is the happiness in my life but now she is a teen and dealing with all of the things going on now in school, social media and bullying. Very bad. I recently went to my doctor and she put me on numerous meds and I have researched them all. Seem dangerous. Want help and to feel better. Want to make right choices. I am now in counseling and in the process of setting up a meeting with a psychiatrist. I feel embarrassed about this but I have come to realize I need help. Looking for answers and help. I am depressed. Never was like this. Every day all day. Husband travels for work and is gone all week, he tells me to get it together. I am stronger than this. Does not support me at all. I am trying to be a good role model for my Granddaughter and do the right things. I am acting like all is well but to feel like this, all day every day is not good.

If I could describe her, it would be narcissistic, and an authoritarian. She has really high, highs. Where she (60 years old) will go clubbing and drinking and smoke with college boys she used to have living with her at her house.  Then she’ll have really low, lows of wanting to run away and/or commit suicide when she has a great life. She hasn’t had to work in over 30 years because my dad (yes, they’re married) has supported her their whole marriage. They make 10k a month because they own two houses and she still has my dad working even though he’s supposed to be retired. She “handles” the finances, but they have SO MUCH DEBT, and she gets overwhelmed by doing anything. If she goes to the store, she has to rest for the whole next day if she goes after 2pm. ANYWAY, she’s a compulsive liar. She kept up a lie for 6-8 months, and after when my husband and I started renting a room from them in their house. Every lie she kept up for those months were brought to the light. And it’s so much worse.  She keeps moldy food everywhere, the house is infested by bugs and rats. She’s constantly finding new fads to do on the internet and then spends hundreds of dollars on them. My sister and I have tried to talk to her about getting checked by a therapist, and she lied to us and told us she did and they said she was perfectly normal. Turns out, she asked her friend that used to be a therapist 8 years ago and her “therapist” friend has MAJOR DEEP issues. I’ve met her once, and I know all about her life and her issues. Which says a lot.  So now every time we try to talk to her about getting help, she turns on her narcissistic personality and turns it around on us. Because she literally makes stuff up. These are all of the things we’ve tried: -The “It's not your fault”  You have not caused this disorder. Genetics and stressful life events put people at greater vulnerability for bipolar disorder. Millions of Americans have bipolar disorder. It can develop at any point in a person's life and is responsible for enormous suffering. - The “Bipolar disorder is a real disease” Just like heart disease or diabetes, it requires medical treatment. There's a medical explanation for bipolar disorder. Disruptions in brain chemistry and nerve cell pathways are involved. The brain circuits -- those that control emotion -- are not working the way they should. Because of this, people experience certain moods and energy levels more intensely, for longer periods of time. We’ve tried everything, and nothing is working. I fear the only thing I will have to do is completely cut her out of my life. Definitely because I’m having my first child in two months and I fear she may be a danger to my child.","Bipolar Disorder , Personality Disorders"

After being told this I did some research on root canals. Based on this information, I think it would be reasonable for me to opt for an extraction instead of a root canal. Using only American Endodontics Association, American Dental Association studies, and other pubmed studies, I learned the following: -Root canal teeth, even when done correctly, have higher endotoxin levels than teeth with vital pulps. The mean value of endotoxin is over 28 times greater in root canal teeth, according to a study published in the Journal of Endodontics. -Root canal teeth are much more likely (about 40% more likely) to be effected by apical periodontitis, according to studies done by the American Endodontics Association and American Dental Association. -Apical periodontitis is strongly associated with brain aneurisms and heart disease, according to pubmed. -Endotoxins are associated with depression symptoms, according to pubmed. Specifically, the study linked root canal endotoxins to depression:    -Root canal procedures are associated with heart disease. People who have a history of root canal procedures are 1.62 times more likely to suffer from heart disease, according to this study:  There are other studies linking root canal procedures with heart disease as well. Also consider that some of those people may have had their root canal teeth removed early on, and this would make those numbers even higher if they had considered this in their data. I also have reason to believe that I have a low level infection that has been going on for a while, or possibly endotoxins interfering with my health. I think this because I've had horrible brain fog and low energy levels for 2 years, but when my dentist put me on a week of penicillin for my wisdom tooth removal, I felt much, much better. Like a fog had lifted for the first time in a while. I also had tachycardia and arrhythmia that went on for 6 months, then mysteriously went away. I've been unemployed for a long time because of my health. I used to be a productive, busy student with 2 jobs and an active social life before this. I think it is more likely my health will improve in the long run if I have my tooth extracted instead of getting a root canal. I want to know if I'm being reasonable. Most of the dentists I have seen dismiss all that I have to say and all my reasons, and act like they're stupid reasons, they seem to think it's ok to ignore the research. I think root canals are something only healthy people should do, because they can take a toll on your body. Also, another dentist started a root canal on that tooth against my wishes, so the tooth is open. I had to take penicillin because my oral surgeon noticed a low level infection had started after the other dentist did that. I wanted to ask this question because I am going to lose my first (non-wisdom) tooth. I know this could possibly effect the alignment of my jaw unless I decide to get an implant, so it's a big decision.","Dental Procedures , Mouth Problems , Tooth Problems"

While working with a psychiatrist and therapist to get my panic under control we tried multiple SSRIs and SNRIs which I did not tolerate well (mainly digestive upsets, headaches, poor concentration and fogginess) and kept me on propranolol ~30mg a day (2 at start of my work day, 1 or 2 in the mid afternoon as needed) as I'm in research and my hands were too shaky from anxiety to properly pipette, carry out dissections or other lab jobs. This really helped with this aspect of my anxiety, and helped give me some confidence in controlling my anxiety before a panic attack emerged as I didn't get noticeably sweaty, shakey or my heart racing. However, this wasn't preventing panic attacks. We tried buspar for panic, and I stayed on this for approximately 2 weeks to a month without noticing any change in anxiety symptoms but started to get chest pain just off center of my sternum to the left. It's not intense or stabbing just a dull ache, and feeling of pressure. My psychiatrist sent me for an ECG to check out my heart and everything there seemed normal, and the doctor there along with my psych decided to take me off of Buspar. This seemed to do the trick as the chest pains went away. This has been approximately a year ago. I had to transition psychiatrists, and during the transition I started taking 1mg of klonopin a day (two 0.5mg). At the new psychiatrist I've continued on the propranolol and klonopin (uped to 1.5mg a day, 0.5 taken 3x a day, am, midday (as needed for breakthrough symptoms) and pm). We tried an atypical antidepressant (I can not recall the name), and Trintellix, both of which I did not tolerate. Over the past 3-4 months the chest pain has been occurring sporadically again.

Friday, it was more prominent but not painful or obstructive.

I am hoping that the amoxicillin and warm salt water will help with keeping the infection under control. I hope I am doing enough until Tuesday.  With that said, I need your help.

It felt swollen, and I couldn't close my mouth. We went to the local dentist, who just filed down my upper molar, and said the pain was caused by me biting my cheek. I don't remember biting my cheek, however he said I may have done so in my sleep. For the next three or four days, it got better, to the point where I could close my mouth again. However, I still had pain when applying pressure to my bottom right molars (felt like biting on my gums). Yesterday, the pain suddenly got much worse and I couldn't sleep, it was throbbing again. In the mirror, I see a small lesion where my upper right molar caught my cheek. I also see the gums are red (inflamed?). I've attached photos that I took myself today. I am 19 years old. I have considered that this may be a wisdom tooth (it would be my second, had my first one on the left lower molar side over a year ago). I am not sure if there is an infection, I feel fine not considering the actual pain. I keep it as clean as I can, rinse with warm salt water and try only chew with my left side (which is difficult without causing pain anyway). I also know that I have a fissured, geographical tongue, I've had that since birth. I am not sure what the redness on my throat is, I don't feel any feverish symptoms. I had an ulcer there over also about a week ago, but I believe that was from drinking tea which was too hot. I will be really grateful for any information on what's going on. I will be going to a different dentist tomorrow, and I prefer to be more aware of what's going on. Thank you! Rob","Mouth Problems , Tooth Problems"

I felt completely normal before I went, but after the week of camp, I felt completely out of place and not myself when I got home. I started noticing as the days went by at the camp that I was having trouble remembering things, and this was really bothering me (I couldn’t remember the characters names of my fav tv show when discussing it with someone. I have also had worse memory since camp). This was the start of it. When the week ended, my dad picked up my brother and I, and we went home. As I was in the car, I noticed something wasn’t right about my perception and my emotional response to everything I saw during the drive. I thought this was just a phase of some sort during puberty, but it has lasted far longer I’d thought it would. Every day after my departure from camp, nothing I enjoyed before has had the same emotional impact on me they once have. Video games, movies, playing outside activities...literally anything that kids my age enjoy. It felt like I was apathetic, but some things were off. This includes the fact that I’m not absent of all emotion, but it feels my emotions are half-hearted or fake. I also act the same I used to when around people, but it doesn’t feel right. I’m never sad, so it couldn’t be depression. If I am ever sad, it’s only because I’m sad about this mental state I’m in that I can’t diagnose. It makes me sad thinking of how all the things I loved before summer camp affected me emotionally. I miss those times when my emotions were real and vivid, and I long for that state of perception I once had. It’s almost like I’m nostalgic about my past emotions. What is wrong with my brain?",

Any information regarding how I can maintain strong exercise habits with MS would be greatly appreciated. A: We know that following a healthy diet and exercising is really important for those of us living with MS. Exercise can help improve symptoms including fatigue and bowel/bladder dysfunction, as well as improve mood. Many of us are prone to muscle weakness and spasticity, and exercises such as yoga, tai chi, swimming, and pilates are great ways to keep our bodies performing at their best. It is also crucial to live a healthy lifestyle to avoid developing other health issues such as diabetes and heart disease- after all, MS is enough on its own!  If you tend to be heat sensitive make sure you are exercising in a well air-conditioned environment and use fans if possible. Hydration is key, and drinking ice water during exercise will help keep your core cooler. There are also many great cooling products including vests and towels that many MSers like to use.  For the first time the National MS Society has funded a study looking at two specific diets to see if either one impacts MS progression and symptoms, so we will all be anxiously awaiting those results! Finally, you can head to the National MS Society's page for more information and resources!    All the best, Stephanie","Living & Managing , Symptoms"

When I was a kid I was diagnosed with ADHD and was given medication to suppress it. I had to ask to be taken off of it because I was no longer eating as much and I had suicidal thoughts. This was in the early 2000's when they were most popular and years later I heard on the radio in the car that some kids that were given meds for ADHD had committed suicide. As expected, my psychiatrist denys any knowledge of this. I don't know if these meds had permanently affected me or not. As I got older my depression got worse and even as a teenager I was always feeling tired or fatigued even though I was active. I will admit for a time as a little kid I did do self harm by hitting myself or banging my head against the wall. I always had problems at school and at home. I self harmed extremely rarely as a teenager but at 16 there was one instance when I slurred my speech. I also had chest pains from stress but was told my heart was healthy after a e.k.g. At 17 I was on the phone when all of a sudden I started slurring my speech, half of my body went numb, and half of my face felt like it was drooping like it was sliding off. It lasted for only maybe 30 seconds or less. At this time I didn't get any help yet because I didn't think my problems were that serious. It wasn't until at 18 when I finally got help because besides having suicidal thoughts, for a couple years having a hard time walking sometimes, not being able to eat sometimes, had a hard time sleeping sometimes, had a hard time getting out of bed sometimes, my memory was fading, had lapses in cognitive ability sometimes, I finally developed erectile dysfunction and my libido was for all intents and purposes completely dead at only 18 years old. Years later after 3 years of anti-depressants and quitting because of side effects, my symptoms regarding memory and cognitive function have gotten worse, the only benefit of the anti-depressant wellbutrin a.k.a bupropion restored most erectile functioning even after quitting it is still functional, lagging in walking happens more often and now there maybe possible heart problems.

It lasts from the time I wake up to the time I go to bed, and often wakes me up during the night. This has been going on now for several months. I have done everything I can think of to find a solution, and ended up with nothing.  I have had imagery done on my shoulder and neck, which showed nothing.  Could this be TMJ? My jaws don't click or crack, with the exception of yawning, but I think that's normal.  My ears seem fine and I can't recall any injuries to my jaw.  Any help or advice would be appreciated.

She has undergone everything in her life from the time that she was a child from a domineering and overbearing mother who was unhappy with her own life and ultimately divorced from her husband, my friends birth father, to being the classic female middle child in a three sibling lower middle class household during the 70's/80's/90's, to not fitting in that well during junior high and high school and beginning at that time to use drugs and alcohol as a social lubricant and early self-medication during her late teenage years. She was, and still is an extremely beautiful girl and woman - inside and out (I have known her since she was 10 years old and I was 12, having moved to the Pacific Northwest at that age and becoming best friends with her oldest brother, who is my age - that being 44 years old...) - I say this because, as is far too often the case with women in general, and attractive women at that, she suffered some VERY extreme sexual assault in her 20's, as well as sexual advances from close family members at several different points in her life. Compounding what I personally believe were long standing and preexisting mental health diagnoses due to genetic and environmental factors, she continued and escalated substance use and abuse at various points in her life as well. She has had some periods of what most of us may consider success on the financial, social, and personal levels - however they are few and far between in comparison to the times in her life that have led to the point that she is at now. I should mention that since I myself have managed to screw my own life up quite well and am just now in the process of (for the first time) actually doing the things that I need to do for myself as well as for any possible other person that I have a relationship with - I knew her on a personal level (she was my first unrequited love FYI...) from the age of 12 to 20 and from the age of 20 to 43, we were out of each others lives completely. It has only been in the last year that we have been together and I very, very, VERY truly love this woman (who I still think of as the sweet, smart, and beautiful girl that I fell in love with as a kid...) more than any other person on the face of this planet. The reason that I stated what I did in the last paragraph is mainly to establish the specifics of our relationship (or lack thereof...) over the last 32 years of our lives. I understand the whole co-dependency issue that we both have, and though I haven't mentioned details of my own life without regard to her, I will also say that I myself am diagnosed with several mental health disorders including Bipolar Depression, Social Anxiety Disorder, ADD, and OCD all stemming from mental and emotionally based PTSD - and I am intelligent enough, even as a layman in the field of psychology to understand that two 'broken' people (for lack of a better word...) will be fighting an extremely uphill battle in a relationship - particularly one that has the dynamics of ours!  That said, since this already so long, let me get right to the point (yeah right... LOL) She has self-medicated with just about every illicit and legal drug that adjusts, for better or worse, the big three (as I call them) neurotransmitters in our brains - being dopamine, norepinephrine, and seratonin. Opiods, stimulants/amphetamines, benzodiazepines, alcohol etc... She has tried various combinations of prescribed medications as well as various different voluntary attempts at treatment for co-occurring disorders on and off since her early twenties. She has had minimal success and has always (sooner or later) relapsed into chemical dependency and progressively worsening mental health. She is diagnosed (she tells me) with what is know as refractory (treatment resistant) depression and thus the effectiveness of conventional treatment, particularly what can be afforded on the state medicaid insurance level have all proven next to fruitless. She is a single mother of a ten year old boy who himself suffers from depression/anxiety, add, and the general things that come along with the exposure to the life that he has had thus far. In the last three years she has had four MAJOR trauma's to compound her already long standing and serious issues. Those being the loss of her father (who was the most important and understanding figure in her life!), the loss a child (due to being still born), the loss of her beloved dog (who was her long time companion of more that 10 years), and most recently the suicide of her last boyfriend (he killed himself while incarcerated). She has been abusing a potent dextroamphetamine/amphetamine prescription by binge taking doses anywhere from 60mgs to over 100mgs several times each day over the course of a week each month, and experiencing an EXTREME lack of sleep and REM function - as well as since I have been with her, at least, she has been suffering from every single classic symptom of schizophrenia that I have seen on this website. I am not sure if this (and this is BY FAR the biggest hurdle that I am facing in my attempts to get her to want to help herself and get a higher quality of help than what the State of Washington can provide!) is due to amphetamine drug induced psychosis, or is the manifestation of preexisting and developing schizophrenia over the course of some or all of her life. In closing I just want whoever may take the time to read this all (hopefully qualified medical personnel...) that she has recently begun talking about taking the next steps that she must to survive much longer, that being inpatient treatment. She is suicidal at times. She is on the verge of homelessness. She believes that I do some of the most horrible things to her. She is on SSDI and a small grant from the state in lieu of her unpaid child support, meaning her income totals $1,150 monthly plus $200 in food benefits to support herself and her son. I make $14 an hour as an inside sales rep and due to required weekly appointments myself and things I doing to better my own life, as well as walking and taking the bus to all of this - I am only working part time at this time. I say these things because SHE NEEDS MORE MODERN AND EFFECTIVE MEDICAL AND MENTAL HELP THAN CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT AND 12 STEP PROGRAMS CAN PROVIDE. Without the financial resources to do so, I honestly believe that she may be dead or institutionalized in the near future. I love her with each and every fiber of my being and will do ANYTHING that I am capable of to help her. I have not always been the best support for her as I haven't fully understood what I believe to be the full picture until recently - and due to personal problems between us and the chaos of living with her this past year - I have been unequipped to deal with things properly and in the best way for her and her son.  So, if anyone out there can offer any advice on how we might get the next level of help so desperately needed - I would most likely owe you my own life - not to mention hers. Thanks so very much for your time and attention on all of this! Damn it is long...

I was only given a 5 day course. so I have 2 days left. am I going to end up back at the dentist or are these 2 antibiotics going to kick in and do some serious bacteria butt kicking? i cant afford to go back (ill have to use another loan which is difficult under my circumstances) but obviously I can't sit with an infected face. has anyone experienced anything similar and things worked out in the first 5 day course or am I holding on to a dream and seeing myself back in the dentist Monday morning?,"Dental Procedures , Mouth Problems , Tooth Problems"

If not then don't start, but if you already do you may want to get serious about quitting. Here is what you need to know about smoking's impact on MS: - Smoking has been linked to an increased risk for developing MS - Smoking may increase the odds of progressing from relapsing-remitting MS to secondary progressive MS -Smoking has been linked to faster MS progression and more disability Additionally smoking increases your risk for heart and lung disease, which can also worsen your MS symptoms. However, on a positive note, the benefits of quitting can be seen in a matter of minutes....YES really! Here's a timeline of what you can expect once you kick the habit: 20 minutes– Your heart rate returns to normal. 2 hours– Your blood pressure and circulation normalize, but unfortunately withdrawal begins. 12 hours– Carbon monoxide levels in your blood return to normal. 24 hours– Your risk of having a heart attack already decreases! 48 hours– Your sense of smell and taste become heightened (nicotine dulls your senses). 3 days– All nicotine is out of your body, unless you are weaning with help from nicotine gum or a patch. 3 weeks– Because of the improvements in circulation and lung function you will be able to tolerate exercise better. Withdrawal symptoms will also significantly improve. 9 months– Your lungs begin to repair themselves resulting in less coughing and shortness of breath, as well as a decreased risk for infections. 1 year– You are officially considered a non-smoker! Your risk for heart disease is also reduced by an incredible 50%. 5 years– Your risk for stroke is significantly reduced. 10 years– You reduce your risk for lung cancer by 50%. You also have a reduced risk for mouth, throat, esophagus, bladder, kidney, and pancreatic cancer. 15 years– You officially have the same risk for heart disease and stroke as a non-smoker, that is a huge accomplishment!

I have had cankers my whole life and get them often after a long weekend of drinking without much sleep. I am 95% sure this is a canker sore, it's definitely inside the lip saliva line and resembles ones I've had in the past.  2. When I was pulling my lip back to see if it was one forming, I noticed a bunch of white spots/bumps inside my lip and all along my saliva line. They stretch the entire length of my upper lip. They are definitely INSIDE my lip and inside the saliva line. You cannot see them from the outside, nor can you see them when I pucker my lips or smile or anything. You can only see them if I flip up my upper lip and stretch it with my fingers. I can barely feel them with my tongue if I try, and they are painless.  3. I have nothing on my bottom lip. I have nothing outside on my lips or face. I feel fine, no other symptoms. No pain, no burning, no tingling. Only the very minor feeling from the small canker sore, which doesn't appear to be growing. While I have gotten cankers my whole life, I have never had a cold sore.

All my dreams, my goal, the things I wanted to do don’t mean anything anymore. I don’t see why people go to work, go to parties, how they can have fun.

This is bordering on obsession to where she HAS to see him on television and gets visibly irritated when he's not onscreen or in an episode.

Approximately two weeks ago, I started having pain and swelling on the right side. Oral surgeon went in and debrided it. No direct cause of infection like a sliver of bone or food particle, just some pus. Started another round of clindamycin and peridex. About 10 days through this course I started having diffuse pain on my left side. The pain is mostly concentrated in the area where I had my extraction, sometimes it feels sore on the upper jaw area on that left side, sinus pain, sometimes I'll get a sharp pain up towards my ear, and sometimes I'll have some numbness/tingling towards my chin. About the only thing that takes it away is 600mg of ibuprofen about every 10 or so hours. I called my surgeons office and I'm going to see him again in 2 days for my follow-up for the right and probably a debridement on the left side as well.  I'm just very scared.

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/54013/debilitating-physical-anxiety-but-not-really-anxious,"Debilitating Physical ""anxiety"" but not really anxious","Hi! I'm a 23 year old male who is considered healthy i.e. not over or under weight, no vitamin/mineral deficiencies, no officially diagnosed medical conditions etc.  This issue is that one day when I was a young teenager about 13/14 years old, I randomly had a panic attack while at home, for no apparent reason that I can remember. Ever since then I have on a few occasions had panic attacks but mostly what's affected me are just episodes of physical anxiety/panic symptoms such as a raised heartbeat, shortness of breath, lightheadedness etc. these episodes would last for maybe a couple of hours or at most till the end of the day and be gone overnight. For most of my life I've managed well with these symptoms, I have lived a very fulfilled and active young life so far (exercising regularly and travelling/going out with friends) with these episodes of physical difficulty only popping up here and there and never usually during the normal working day hours, in fact I would sometimes go weeks even months without feeling a thing and then they might come up again here and there, but would eventually subside into a 'dormant' state again.  In other words it has never bothered me or gotten in the way of me living, even when at the time it would feel uncomfortable and very unpleasant, once it was over life would go back to normal. Until now, around late December 2017 I was out with a friend and we took the train to an event and when we got off the train and began walking I felt strangely dizzy and out of breath, I then felt some discomfort around my left chest and my heart rate increased, causing a bit of pain in the upper left chest near the armpit. This of course distressed me as it felt quite strong as if something dangerous was going to happen and this impacted the entire day out, we stayed out but the entire time my symptoms did not relent and I felt physically very distressed the whole time.  Despite the episode being quite difficult and traumatic, I felt better within about 2 days, putting the whole thing down to these 'physical symptoms' that I've had here and there for 10 years but just a stronger than normal episode. Fast forward to about early March 2018 and I was going out to see my friend again, not for the first time since, however I kept having this worry in the back of my mind telling me ""I hope those horrible feelings don't prop up again this time !"" Surely enough they gradually did and on a bus ride back home I was an absolute wreck, insanely fast heart rate, difficulty breathing, pain in left chest, pins and needles, light head, sickness in stomach and so on. It felt terrible and the feelings went down a little when I was home but nowhere near entirely and the next day I tried to go out and do things like normal but I just couldn't, those uncomfortable physical sensations were still there overnight and I decided to go to A&E. I had a panic attack in the waiting room, which although I brought to the attention of the receptionist they did nothing about and was told to just wait and the doctor would come. They kept me in all day around 10 hours doing various tests like ECG and bloods. In the end they told me there was nothing wrong and just sent me home since by the end of the day I was ""a bit better"" but was definitely not feeling normal, I still had an uncomfortable sensation in my chest, pins and needles and light headedness with short breath.  Since that day these distressing physical sensations were at the forefront of my mind, rather than in the back where they'd always been, and everyday I've had to go through feeling them, almost all day. I'll either feel short of breath(sometimes from my throat, sometimes from my diaphragm), light headed, have a fast heart beat, feel an uncomfortable heavy pulling and pinching sensation in my left chest/armpit region, chattering teeth, feelings of doom and sadness etc. at some point and this had prevented me from enjoying life as normal. Before I was a happy go lucky, active young man but now I feel worried/sad all the time and caged in by these constant physical difficulties that stop me from enjoying life and wanting to do the things I usually love like travelling and sports. My GP says it's all 'Maybe anxiety related' which isn't a helpful diagnosis. I'm on no medication and currently in a 12 week waiting queue for over the phone CBT therapy. I've gone through alot of CBT self help resources and even a CBT video course offered by my workplace, but they have been very limited in helping me, although I do feel slightly better by understanding how the thought process of a person works when panicked or anxious, the physical affects still remain and still give me great difficulty. As a person I have no real worries, I'm in a great job, have a very supportive and loving family and good friends too. I have hobbies that I enjoy and in general I've always just enjoyed life to the fullest till now, I feel like my life is at a standstill and has completely nose dived since feeling like this. When my symptoms are not as strong and I'm having a 'good day' where perhaps I find myself able to go out with friends/family or to work without much or any physical difficulty I feel like I'm close to myself again and almost instantly start feeling better, until they come up again and I fall right back into feeling upset/distressed and just not like myself.  I apologize that this is so long but I really needed to get this off my chest and explain myself in detail to get the best response :). Thank you all if you've made it this far, I just want to know what could be done about this? Is there a name for what I have? Is there a form of therapy and/or medication that can help me? Essentially I just want to feel back to normal and like myself again, free, happy and active, not trapped, distressed and physically uncomfortable. Thank you","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression , Personality Disorders"

I ended up taking a very large dose of 200mg in a hours span of time. Thirty minutes after my last does my head started to feel off. My head felt as if their was a ring around it, like I was wearing a hat. Also my head was slightly tingly, felt like thousands of tiny massages at once. I wasn't in any pain and I'm wondering what's wrong with me? Other than the aforementioned symptoms, I Feel fine. I did a quick search online and I have no notable symptoms of an overdose. I just have this one symptom I can't explain... Note: I do not wear hats, nor any kind of helmet which would suggest that this would happen as a result of actually having a ring of pressure around my scalp. My request is not urgent, but I am slightly nervous over what may come of this.","Depression , Self Harm , Substance Abuse"
