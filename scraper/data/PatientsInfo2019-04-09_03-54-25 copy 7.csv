Theres been no improvement This is a drawing i made approximating what i see. A few large remnants and dozens if not hundreds of small grains  mostly in the upper field of vision I'm not sure of his explanation and plan of (non) action for a few reasons  i believe that the specs I'm seeing are on a fixed surface of my eye for two reasons  first, if i stare at a fixed soot and move only my head the spots do not move at all   if they were floating in liquid i would expect SOME movement   second because they always remain the same location in relation to each other. So that a larger triangle shaped remnant  and a smaller straight , stick shaped remnant are always the same distance from each other for the past two weeks   id expect them to move over time if they were floaters in liquid Even if they are floaters, I mistrust his plan of letting then dissolve on their own   At first I asked how often this happens and he said maybe 1 in 1000 times.  But when i asked him how often he sees them going away on their own he couldn't give me an answer   He said patients disappear so they don't always check in so he can see the remnants are gone.  I asked how he knew they might dissolve away and he said thats what the body does   it reabsorbs things like this eventually   it sounded like guesswork to me he seemed more concerned that the tear wouldn't get worse or get infected.  And of course I want to be sure that doesn't  happen. But my goal is also to have clear vision  and it concerns me that he seems so unconcerned and I feel like i've merely traded in one eye condition  for another sorry for the lengthy explanation but any insight (pun intended) would be appreciated 0 likes, 3 replies "

The flickering after pupil dilation miraculously stops. This happens because the capsule complex wobbles inside the eye, catching the light (probably more on the edges, with side lighting, but also on the plate, with frontal lighting) and making the light flickering. There are several videos proving that disturbance (check on youtube ""ewa ingram flickering""). According to several doctors, it happens when patient's ciliary muscles are still active (usually in young people), they contract making the capsule and lens to wobble because of loose zonular system. Using dilating eye drops, it paralyzes the  ciliary muscles, fixing the iol wobbling. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I initially had above average close vision but somewhere in my 40s distances became a bit difficult and I was prescribed bifocals with clear glass bottoms. I then required glasses to drive but improvement in distance vision and minor deterioration close up reversed this. My 10 year of diabetes has seen my eyes examined annually then 6 monthly as other issues surfaced.  , Epiretinal Membrane (shadows on the orange with red lines image) and a slowly growing hole in the centre of the retina image. At my latest review I was advised to have the cataracts attended to. I was told after this procedure I would require glasses to read. As I did not do much personal reading I went ahead without sufficient thought. Pre surgery I was content with vision, only requiring glasses when clarity for long vision was required. I could perform everything close without aid except for small print when magnification was required. Now 4 weeks post second eye-op I am struggling with everything within arms length which is really where we live. Little or no improvement is expected. Hundreds of things I used to do I cannot without the size 2s they gave me. These obtain clarity at only a definite specific distance and while I have them on everything else is a blur. I have to hang them low and look above for any distance. While I needed glasses before only on specific occasions I now need them handy 24/7. Apparently the membrane problem prevented the implant of multi-focal lenses. This is apparently also applicable to certain occupations. On the plus side white is whiter, blue bluer and the things at a distance I needed assistance to see clearly are now possible without. Not much of a beneficial trade for what I have lost. I don’t know what technicians learn from all the “which dots are clearer A or B” but I feel some evaluation of my extreme loss of overall vision should have been possible to give such advice and recommendation when so little cataract effect was there. I know something had to be done some time if I lived that long but believe technician remuneration may have been an issue. Has anyone any information on likely timing of cataract causing vision loss and if there is any experience or evidence of over-servicing and profiteering in this area.

I had Macular Edema in both eyes a short while after my cataract surgeries, but this seems to have cleared up according to my retinal scans and multiple examinations.  Once my Macular Edema cleared up in both eyes I had the YAG laser to clear up my posterior capsular opacification.  The next morning after my YAG laser, I woke up and I knew something was terrible wrong, In dim light (even indoors with fluorescent lighting), I could see a fuzzy halo around lights and starbursts too.  At night time when I am driving, every light ranging from headlights to traffic lights….any light at night, I can see long stretched out spiky starbursts.  The brighter the light (like those super bright headlights you see in newer cars), the longer and stretchy the starburst will be.  Every once in a while the starburst will also have a rainbow effect to it that is inside the starburst itself.  Note:  I am seeing the starbursts with or without my glasses, so it wouldn't be residual   like my doctor thought it might be.  I am also seeing bright oddly shaped circle lights every morning right now like when I had my macular edema, when I went to my doctor he did another retinal scan of my eyes but it showed no macular edema.  My vitreous gel seems to be a mess also, I can live with floaters, but now it seems like the vitreous gel is clumping together or something, and when I look to the left and right or up and down I see like something hazy and sweeping going the opposite way that I am looking.  I asked if my lenses got pitted or damaged or something during my YAG laser treatment but my doctor said no.  My doctor had some ""copy and paste"" explanation for everything (like basically well…just live with it), so I went to see a second doctor (at my HMO hospital), and after her examination she basically said the same thing ""well you're seeing 20/20 with glasses"" along with her ""copy and paste"" explanations as well.  Not happy with her responses, I asked politely to be referred to the retinal surgeon…she didn't like it that much, and after that her demeanor changed for the worse.  So moving forward…I've been researching  Dr. Google (doctors hate when I do this, lol), I was thinking that maybe they should widen the YAG treatment area more (maybe it will clear up  the starbursts cause I have large pupils), and maybe I should get a vitrectomy (for my clumpy vitreous gel or whatever else it might be that is possibly pulling at my retina causing the circles of light in the morning right when I wake)?  I see the retinal surgeon later this month, is there any suggestions you guys might give me that I might bring to the table when I see him?  I feel like I am going blind or something.

I'd like to know whether a a stronger prescription can temporarily take care of cataract problems. My glasses prescriptions are -3.25 L and -4.0 R. Left eye has no cataract. Overall, my vision is not too bad at all, because my left eye carries most of the load. But if I cover it and look at the TV, for example, I can hardly read any text on the screen. I haven't seen an optometrist, so now I'm questioning if my right eye prescription is correct. I have been seeing an ophthalmologist for the last 2 or 3 years, but, other than checking the development of the cataract, they never check the prescription. So I experimented a bit, using some of my old glasses and may have found something interesting...or not, I don't know. I've printed a copy of  Snellen Eye Chart and placed it on the wall, and stood about 10 feet away. My left (no cataract) eye is perfect, as I can read everything on the chart with any problems (with glasses, of course). The right (cataract) eye, as expected, is a completely different story. I can't read even the biggest font. However, when I use my old glasses, and places them on top of the ones I'm wearing, I can read the top 4 lines, maybe even the 5th. By placing old lens on top of the existing, I am probably changing my -4.0 to something close to -7.0 (not quite sure what the old prescription was). Does any of this make any sense? Could I possibly postpone the surgery by getting stronger prescription on my right eye? Even if I can, would I maybe run into a completely different problem, where the difference in prescriptions between my eyes would be almost 4 diopters, whereas now it is only 0.75? I'd really appreciate any feedback, especially if anybody had successfully ""cheated"" on their cataract by stronger prescription. Of course, ""cheating"" would be only temporary, until my left eye develops a cataract as well (might take a few years, nobody knows), and then I do them both. Thanks! 0 likes, 7 replies "

Trouble seeing at night.  Very blurry close up until about 5-6 inches. And it's getting worse, so I'm ready for the surgery. Also a high degree of astigmatism in the right eye (but not the left), so I'm getting the Toric IOL. My left eye is -2.5. I was originally thinking of going for a 0 in the right eye - wouldn't that be nice, to be able to see distances without my glasses? But I was told the difference in diopters is too great, and I'd have to wear a contact lens in my left eye (at least until that one needs the surgery as well, which could be anywhere from 6 months to 10 years). And that sounds horrible. Then I realized that what I REALLY want is what I've been used to my whole life - perfect near vision. I like to read (a lot!), and I'm also a (semi-retired) software developer, so I spend lots of time in front of the computer, on the phone, etc. Until I was about 40, I had perfect near vision to about 2-3 feet - so I never used my glasses for either reading or the computer. In a perfect world, I'd be able to regain that ability after the surgery. My left eye (which is dominant) still sees perfectly well at about 12 inches, so I can ""sort of"" read, but it's not very pleasant - even with the reading glasses I got a few months ago to correct the right eye. I was originally told my choices were ""distance, intermediate, or near"" - meaning 0, -1 or -2. I was leaning towards getting -2, because even with a -1, there would still be a 1.5 diopter difference between left and right, and I understand that's pushing the limits - although apparently my all-around vision will be better by getting rid of the astigmatism. I guess the doctor doesn't want to confuse people, but after a little research, I asked about numbers in between those, and she said, ""Sure, we also offer a -1.6."" So what I'm wondering about is, what would be the difference between a -2 and a -1.6 toric IOL in my right eye, with the left eye at -2.5? Would I be able to both read at ""normal"" book length (12 inches or so), and read the computer screen (24-36 inches) without glasses? That would be my dream... Or, if I go for the -2, would I still need computer glasses (or progressives), as I've been using the last 15 years? (And which I hate...). Above all, I REALLY don't want to have to wear any glasses when I'm reading. My entire life, I've enjoyed taking off my glasses and getting in bed with a book... As they said in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, ""I'm soooo confused!"" Any thoughts or ideas are appreciated!

In the fifth surgery by another doctor the correct iol was used and re-inserted correctly.  However the results were not good.  I had only degraded vision.    I delayed surgery on my right eye as long as I could and finally decided to do the surgery on my right eye about three months ago.  That surgery went well.  My surgeon used an iol that gave me good near vision and it does.  The doctor said he thought this would be best considering the condition of my left eye.   I could see great up to about three feet and then everything would blur.  After two months the doctor said I could get glasses.   The prescription was -4.00 for both eyes.  I got my glasses about two weeks ago and could see very good with them.  I knew I would need to allow an adjustment period but everything seemed great the first week.  In the second week I started getting nasty headaches especially over my left eye.  I would wake up feeling good and energetic and about three hours later was exhausted and had to lay down.  These symptoms progressed and were getting worse through the week. Yesterday I took the glasses off and felt somewhat better but that left me with my limited vision.  Amazingly my vision seems better than before the glasses.  Today I woke, felt good, went grocery shopping, and on the way home decided to retry my new glasses.  Within minutes I felt off balance, like my eye was pulling to the side, and nauseous.   I removed the glasses and slowly I am feeling better.  Tomorrow I will call my eye surgeon.  Yesterday I took my glasses to where I had them made and they checked the glasses and told me they were as my prescription called  for. The only explanation I can think of is my eyes were not finished adjusting and now I may need a different prescription.   Also, I found my vision is now better, not good, than the day I got the glasses.   Commends appreciated, thanks. 0 likes, 7 replies "

I was still reading 20/25 with contact lens but had bad glare.  I had a toric IOL implantednd am now slightly  undercorrected in that eye both power and some  . I struggle to read 20/25 with much blur so the surgeon sent me to optomotrist for refraction. I am now wearing a -.50 contact lens in my surgery eye which gets me 20/20 vision. My left eye has a cataract but with a -4.50 toric lens I am still reading 20/20.  So, no plans to have surgery on that eye right now. I can no longer wear glasses at all due to imbalance between eyes. So, I am in my contacts many hrs. each day. my vision with both eyes open seems a bit off...like my eyes are not working together. In low light I sometimes see ghosting or double vision only on high contrast items like lit store signs, LED light on alarm clock, crawl on television. This is with both eyes open. sometimes if I use artificial tears I can get the images to meld. The closer I get to the high contast writing the better. My near vision with readers is clear and not ghosted. Other objects in the room are not ghosted...just the  lit writing. I feel like the image in my right eye is slightly larger than the image in my left eye and this might be causing the ghosting? I am thinking I will have this issue until my left cataract is removed or unless neuroadaptation by my brain  occurs. Has this happened to others after having only one IOL implanted? Is there any solution? Also, i have worn contacts for 49 years. My surgeon did not have me remove my contacts for weeks or even days prior to mapping that is done before surgey.

Would appreciate your views on whether on not you believe Im suffering from gout or something else. For 5 months I've had fairly symmetrical pains throughout my joints. First felt in my toes, then fingers, knees, wrists, arms and shins. I'm mostly affected now in my fingers, at the finger tips, with my index fingers becoming quite swollen with loss of motion. Also my arms are sore. I find it painful to pick up most objects, typing and putting some of my fingers in cold water is uncomfortable. My fingers are showing signs of what is either herberden nodes or possibly tophi (although not at all as extreme as some pictures you see). Looking at online pics I'm tempted to think they are herberden nodes. My fingers feel like they are almost someone else's, as a result of the swelling. I'm also finding I'm a bit clumsy with them dropping things occasionally. One of my middle toes has gone quite thick 'bony' but apart from that there are no other physical ""tells"" that are obvious. My GP asked for an x-ray of my hands in February which showed only minor wear and tear possibly   he thought in the fingers. However they have become much more swollen since then. At the start of the year uric acid levels were up to 440 from 400 in the previous year; and most recently were recorded as 590. I was put on a course of Colchicine in January to ""test"" for gout which had no positive effect, Prednisolone has been tried a couple of times which did help, and I've now been taking Allopurinol for 6 weeks with no positive effect, although in the first week of treatment it was combined with Colchicine - when on that occasion I was in less pain than on the first occasion when Colchicine was used. Im a 47 year old male. Not over weight. Dont drink heavily but do enjoy a beer (which Ive currently cut out) re purines. I'd imagine most people would agree that these are not the typical symptoms of gout; since they did not begin with swelling of the big toe, I have no 'redness' of skins, and I have sharp pains which have been going on for months, rather than 'flare ups for a few weeks only'. However I think what's pushing my GP to think in that direction is the symmetrical nature (ie unlikely to be osteoarthritis but rather is inflammation of some kind) and the elevated uric acid. I've asked if I can be referred to a reumatologist and he's said they wouldn't look at my case while my bloods are not showing an issue e.g. no raised rheumatoid factor. Should I be pushing this? Or if necessary trying to get a (hopefully not to costly) private assessment? I became convinced it was  , however things are not worse in the mornings and as said bloods are not showing raised Rheumatoid factor. Reading about early stage RA experiences, it does however suggest that morning stiffness and positive   may however not be present.  Appreciate greatly you reading my story (sorry for the length). If you have an observations then it would be much appreciated. Thanks Michael 0 likes, 14 replies "

I'm a 36 year old man living in California, 5'11"" tall and weighing 190lbs (13.5stone). I am in decent shape, exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet (rarely any of these high purine foods). I do drink a fair amount of alcohol (until recently) - a couple of beers, maybe a glass of wine or two and a whiskey night cap most everyday. I do eat marmite on toast every morning which I've shockingly just found is one of the foods to avoid (thank you UK factsheets!) I gained a fondness for Vegemite after spending some time in Australia! I'm super active and played competitive sports until pretty recently. I'm an avid swimmer, runner, hiker, biker etc. About 2.5 years ago I woke up after sleeping with my foot in a weird position to excruciating pain in my ankle. Believed it was a weird tendon irritation from sleeping in a weird position. Doctor suggested gout but I totally blew it off as something that only happens to corpulent middle aged men. Nothing came up on X-ray. The pain went away in a few days and I didn't think much else of it. A little over a year later I had a very similar thing happen in my other ankle. Then about 6-months ago I woke up with a very similar thing in my elbow - again nothing on X-rays and physical therapist I visited thinking it was a tendonitis issue was baffled. The elbow pain lasted a couple of weeks and was especially painful at night. But then with NSAIDs and rest went away and has been totally fine since. Currently I have a similar issue going on in my left big toe which at first I thought was an injury as I did roll over on my toe joint playing sport. The pain in this area though is what led me back to thinking it's possibly gout. The   seems to be instigated by some sort of minor injury each time. As I'm so active I've just sort of believed up until now that it's aches and pains of getting older after some kind of sporting activity I've been doing. The pain has been quite bad but nothing compared to more severe gout flare ups I've been reading about. My brother (2-years younger) has similarly had some strange joint pains the last couple of years and was recently tested high for uric acid - he suggested I get my levels checked. So in between this elbow flare up and this toe flare up I did get tested about 3 months ago. Uric acid level was 8.9 mg/dL. Which I didn't really understand at the time but now I looked up these results I understand that it is well into hyperuricemia (high blood uric acid greater than ~6mg/dL) territory. And the genetic link here seems pretty obvious. So not sure I really have any specific questions but just wanted to hear any thoughts the community may have on my situation. I am working on drinking plenty of water each day. Doctor has suggested some dietary changes and reduced alcohol and test again in a couple of months time to see if it's a continued high level. Will then discuss plan for the future. Allopurinol (for long-term uric acid reduction) and colchicine (for flare ups) will be discussed. I am hesitant to sign up for a lifetime medication unless absolutely necessary. The thought of long term joint damage, not being able to be physically active, chronic joint pain, and the cardiovascular risks from hyperuricemia scare the crap out of me. I feel like I'm way too young and healthy to be having these types of conditions....so really just trying to make sense of it all. Thank you all for your time. 0 likes, 11 replies "
Gout and Pseudogout,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-ve-had-gout-for-a-year-now-advice-needed-regarding-medication-639974,I've had 'gout' for a year now - advice needed regarding medication,"Quick bit of history... One year ago I had a gout attack in my left ankle - came on in the middle of the night. Initially it was extremely painful (couldn't walk without crutches), but there was no redness or heat from the area so the doctor dismissed gout and sent me for an x-ray as they thought I'd broken it. X-ray came back clear and by this point my ankle was hot so they sent me for blood tests. Gout was confirmed by high levels of Uric acid. I was given a dose of Naproxen, within a day or so it got better and I could walk again. I finished the dose which was perhaps 2 weeks and by this point there was just a bit of pain in my ankle when rotating it round but I could walk again. I lasted about a day or so without the tablets before it came back in the night, I got a repeat prescription quickly and took them the next day and it went pretty much straight away. I took the dose which again was 2 weeks and went back to the doctors. They prescribed me another dose but asked me to not take them until it started again. 1 year later I still have the unopened packet of Naproxen as it never came back again.  They have just sent me for blood tests again and have phoned to say that I still have high levels and they'd like to put me on Allopurinol to lower it - they want to start at 100mg and then increase it after a couple of weeks. They told me the limit for Uric acid was 360 and mine was 517. I eat healthily and exercise regularly - I run at least 50 miles a month and do quite a few half marathons. Since I had gout I only normally drink water - I drink over 2L of water every day. The only time I drink anything else is when out for a meal etc. I do drink alcohol but it is very infrequent, I might have 5 or 6 drinks perhaps 4 times a year - I don't drink at home (unless we have a party) (boring I know!) To make a good guess I reckon all but 1 day a month, all I drink is water. In the last few weeks I've been training hard for a run that is coming up so I have also been drinking protein recovery shakes which I have found have helped with recovery for my calf muscles. I have drunk one of these after a hard run (600ml) in addition to the at least 2L of water I drink every day. I have declined the Allopurinol for now, partly due to the fact that I have this run coming up in a few weeks and don't want the risk of the tablets upsetting things. And partly as I wanted to research it more first. The Doctor gave me the impression that given my diet and the fact that I drink plenty of water, that they don't think that I could lower my levels through a change of diet. I also mentioned that during the past year I've had moments where if it was diet, then I would have thought I'd have triggered it (All inclusive holiday for a week - where I ate far too much and drank alcohol every day). So they don't think it is diet related but said that it could push it over the edge. Before I had gout, I often didn't drink enough during the day at work and didn't go to the toilet at work. So that has been my biggest change since having the attack. I'd more or less forgotten about it given that I've not even had a twinge since (the ankle continued to hurt when running for a couple of months but I put that down to damage the crystals had done) - but that has all gone now and I get no pain from it. I kind of hoped the blood test would say the levels were normal now and I could forget about it. I don't really want to go on to the tablets and the doctors have given me the option to leave it for a year and see what happens over this year. I'm down for annual blood tests for life now. However I'm just concerned about whether or not the high uric acid levels will cause any long term damage? If it helps I'm Male and 35. Otherwise fit and healthy. Has anyone got any advice regarding the medication given that I have only had one attack? Most people seem to have had multiple attacks when I've read up about it. 0 likes, 36 replies "

Gout and Pseudogout,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/long-lasting-gradually-intensifying-toe-joint-pain-695038,Long-lasting gradually intensifying toe joint pain,"Hello community - I started to get a twinge of discomfort in that big toe joint about 2-3 weeks ago. Kind of blocked it out and carried on as normal. It gradually intensified and got a bit more swollen and stiff so it hurts to push off on that toe and ball of my foot while walking or running now. It's been at the same level now for about 10-days. Now this isn't the classic   flare up of intense pain that I hear about from gout sufferers - but it is located right in that classic joint that gout goes after. I've had a handful of what I think might be mild gout flares in the last couple of years. Not had a formal diagnosis. The flares have been in my toe, ankle and elbow and separate times and all dissipated fairly quickly with only mediocre pain intensity compared to what I hear gout can be like. X-rays of joints have all been clear. UA blood levels were up around 9mg/dL a year ago and then after diet and lifestyle adjustments have been between 7-8 mg/dL the last few months.  I'm in my mid-30s and very active so even though this pain is mild it is not allowing me to walk and run and do much of the sports activities I typically do. Any ideas on this? Does this sound gout related or something else? I have started taking some ibuprofen and got some turmeric and some tart cherry and celery seed extract supplements to try and get down the inflammation and further reduce the urate. I'll be going to see my GP this week so we will see what the docs have to say if anything... I feel like they tent to treat acute symptoms and send you on your way and if you aren't totally crippled with pain and disability they don't take you seriously enough! 0 likes, 22 replies "

I also had Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and a complete Thyroidectomy in my 20s. I take Levothyroxine daily and I do believe there could be some relationship between Thyroid issues and Granuloma Annulare.   I have been on this forum many times just as frustrated as many of you have been and are about your Granuloma Annulare.  I have had it on my feet (thinking it was Athlete's foot) even as a teenager and eventually it left my feet and started on my elbows.  The thickening bumps on my elbows eventually spread to the inside of my arms and especially my forearms.  It was itchy and unsightly, red and sometimes swollen.  It even started on my left middle finger, and still appears there under the skin, I assume that my wedding ring aggravates it. Cortisone cream has been my friend.  It kept the redness to a minimum and was soothing, but didn't help it go away.   I want to share with you what finally worked for me:    a 5 mg dose of Prednisone for 10 days, then tapering off to none over a week.  The redness subsided and the reaction to the Prednisone seemed to soothe it all together, even though the ridges were still visable slightly.  Over a month, the skin returned to a normal color and the ridges left.  It wasn't completely gone, so the same dose was repeated a second time and it started to go away completely. I have not been on Prednisone since.   I have been free of the itching and unsightly ridges and rash for over a year now!  The Prednisone stopped the autoimmune cycle within my body and I am no longer suffering from full blown, aggravating Granuloma Annulare!  I can tell that there is still that tendancy underlying in my skin, because I get a little itchy inside my elbows at times and I wonder when or if it will come back.  But when it does, I know what to do to stop it!  I've never been so grateful in my life for something that worked for me.  I know that everyone's body is different and this might not be the answer for you, but it was for me.   I'm hoping this information helps someone as desperate as I was.

Granuloma Annulare,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-cured-my-granuloma-annulare-609767,I cured my Granuloma Annulare,"I suffered with Granuloma Annulare 5 years ago.  It started with either small red patches on my feet to pink 'ring-worm' type rings on my arms, legs and groin area.  The rings then then turned into large dark purple coloured particularly on the rear of my thighs and groin area.  The patches located in my groin have actually damaged the skin and the skin is quite wrinkled here. I saw Doctors and Skin Specialists but no-one was able to provide a cure and the most I was offered was very thick make-up to cover the lesions which I was not intending to use. I purchased and read 'The Liver and Gallbladder Miracle Cleanse' back to back and found very useful information which i thought might help.  Basically, a number of immune and other problems will manifest a reaction in your intestine and the first area to show a problem will be the skin, therefore the body needs to be reset and flushed out in order for the organs to function correctly.  I also met someone who successfully completed  es on a monthly basis, this person suggested I also visit a Kinesiologist to understand areas where i might be vitamin and mineral defficient.   I then embarked on a 6 month programme of completing a full cleanse for one week every month.  This basically consisted of following  's 7 day detox programme which means you only drink pre-prepared fresh fruit/vegetable juices every day for 7 days.  I started the juice programme on a Saturday until Friday morning, Friday lunchtime I underwent a colonic and followed the Liver and  e Friday evening and the following Saturday morning.  Each day during the 6 month period I took up to between 2000-5000 mg Vitamin C, 2000-5000 mg of Vitamin D, MSM, Combination tissue Salt A and D and Molybdenum daily for the entire 6 month period which has been prescribed by the Kinesiologist. After each cleanse, I felt amazing and my Granuloma reduced in colour each month until it finally disappeared after 6 months and has not reappeared. During this time I tried to keep my diet as healthy as I could minimising sugar, wheat, meat and alcohol.  I did however, notice that on days I veered off healthy foods and say, drank a few glasses of alcohol, the patches would redden.   This routine may not work for everyone but it certainly worked for me and I now tell everyone I know of the benefits of following that routine.  You also lose weight, feel lighter, far more energised, your skin will start to look amazing and your quality of sleep will improve.  Once you have completed the week long ritual, your body actually craves healthy food over processed. I was so desperate to be rid of the awful lesions I happily stuck to the rigid process every month.  I can now happily wear shorts, bikinis, skirts, short sleeved tops.   After going through a rather stressful 2 years I have decided to follow the routine again for a couple of months just to give myself an energy boost. I hope my experience helps someone else who is desperate to remove this awful affliction.   4 likes, 7 replies "

THANK YOU!  He said she had tried MSM/sulfer crystals daily and he could tell the GA lesions were fading.  I had always believed GA was some kind of auto-immune reaction, and I have sensitive skin in general to makeup products, etc. so I began researching sulfer/MSM and discovered it is one of the trace minerals our bodies need but that is lacking in modern diets.  I decided, “What the heck, it can’t be any worse and the cost is low.”  I began usage in late August 2017 and within weeks my lesions no longer itched and by the 3 month mark my husband noted a visible fading. I returned to wearing shorts & swimsuits this May.  I am here to tell you there is absolutely NO TRACE of a lesion (and I had many, large ones) anywhere on my body now! That’s one year for anyone reading!  After 10 years of suffering with this strange affliction I am beyond thrilled!

If I had more than 3 refills of tea, diluting it, I would add another 1/2 tsp.  My profile picture has the specific brand I ordered on Amazon but there are many others available I believe would likely be effective as well (this is NOT an advertisement for this brand-just trying to be helpful).  I chose organic because I hoped it would be the purest form.  I continue to use it in my tea each morning; I have never been a coffee person but that man’s wife used it in coffee. Good luck to all my fellow GA sufferers.  I hope this helps at least one of you out there!  Food really is the source of both our health and our lack of it.  God speed! 3 likes, 24 replies "
Granuloma Annulare,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/new-to-this-group-and-i-m-trying-something-new--698533,New to this group...and I’m trying something new. ,"I've had bilateral GA for about 17 years.  It started on my elbows and tried cortisone creams without any luck.  it moved to my hands about 9 years ago...tried cortisone cream again...and again no luck...once some bumps cleared up new ones appeared.   My medical history is of hypothyroidism. I have noticed that dust and handling paper (filing at work) seems to aggravate it.  The one reprieve from GA that I've had is when I eliminated grains, processed sugars, junk food.  i didn't stick to this way of eating and the GA came back.  Maybe this is coincidental or maybe it's a solution. My GA has come back with a vengeance.  It is on my lower and upper arms and hands  I look like I have a quite the case if ringworm.   Becoming more frustrated with the GA, I started doing some more research on potential causes.  One potential culprit are vaccines....particularly Hep B.  I had Hep B vaccine many years ago....~20 years.  I had multiple adverse reactions to the vaccine - hair loss, scalp rash, extreme joint point, discoid plaques on my forearms; all occurring  over a one year period.  I think it's probably a good chance that the vaccine triggered the GA as well. Since the cortisone creams and the prescribed creams don't seem to work, I read that aloe vera has helped some.  I've been using it for about a week.  The bumps seem less red and irritated, and have flattened out somewhat.  I am using 99% pure aloe with and without alcohol.   I am hopeful.  Even if it doesn't go away, it looks a little better and feels better too. 0 likes, 4 replies "

So about a couple months ago I woke up and went to go eat breakfast and all of a sudden I my head started to feel weird and I got a brief blind spot in the corner of my left eye. I felt confused and I thought I was going to faint. I went down to lie down for a bit and all of a sudden I started to get chills. This lasted for about an hour and then the symptoms subsided and I felt ok. I went to the eye doctor and they did a scan and said what I probably experienced was on Ocular   and it wasn't anything to worry about. So of course stupid me just writes it off as nothing. Few months pass and I experience the same thing on March 11th around 3pm , but this time without the blind spot or halo in the eye. Just weird feeling in my head, like something was off and I was about to lose control accompanied by almost a hypoglycemic feeling, ( I hadn't eaten since 10am that day ) followed by chills that lasted about an hour. I thought maybe since i hadn't eaten anything I was feeling shaky or weird so I had something to eat. Ok I said, if this happens again I'm going to the doctors. The next day it happened again. I immediately made an appointement with my primary care doctor . We checked for Diabetes,  , Low Blood Sugar, Hypoglycemia, and all that stuff and everything came back fine on my blood work. Doctor said it's   but I don't really have much stress in my life at the moment and I do get anxious when I'm in a social setting but nothing like this.  After this second episode I felt very disconnected and almost in a haze or heavy brain fog for a week or so. When I went for a follow up visit on the 27th of March on my way to the Doctors office my head felt weird again like I was about to lose control or in the foggy state. I was scared to drive home but the feeling passed after awhile. When I told him about it he just brushes it off. He did the all the typical neurological tests to see if my arm and leg strength were ok, following his fingers , standing up straight , walking in a straight line etc. Everything checked out. Now when I wake up in the mornings my head feels weird again. And if I touch the top of my head it makes the feeling worse. Its just a very concerning thing. I don't know if it's anxiety and I'm not sure if this can be related to a gut issue as my stools have been loose and flat . Docs thinks i might have IBS . I'm being tested for Celiac and IBS. He says I don't need to see a neurologist so I can't see one unless he gives me a clinical referral . I'm just worried its something more than anxiety because when I touch my head in feels worse. I don't get headaches but man when I get the feeling I feel confused and really weird. 0 likes, 2 replies "
Cancer,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-never-feel-hungry-can-this-be-anything-other-than-cancer-distraught-549905,"I NEVER feel hungry, can this be anything other than cancer? Distraught ","Hello, I am a 25 year old male, I've searched the internet high and low but there doesn't seem to be any reassurance out there for me. I lost my appetite seeminly over night about 3 months ago. Over that time I have seen 4 different doctors and they have presribed various things like   and acid reflux as I have also had mild digestive complaints on and off. None of these have had boosted my appetite though. I still enjoy eating and do so to keep my energy levels up, but I never actually get hungry and sometimes I get bloated after meals. I also had a colonscopy (I requested it) to rule out colon   and it was all clear so the doctor just gave me anti-  meds assuming my lack of appetite was psychological. Only thing is I'm convinced it's not and have seen another doctor who I persuaded to give me an ultrasound. Doctor doesn't seem too worried though and just seemed to imply I'm a hypochondria.    Assuming I am right about the lack of appetite being physical, can I really be anything else but cancer? I'm convinced what I am experiencing now is cachexia, or wasting from late stage cancer. I can't help but think it's   with liver mets as I also have digestive complaints (have even had floating stools for a while now), I initially considered this just to excedingly rare in people my age but my symptoms just seems textbook. All in all just can't really believe this is happenning and I'm terrified about the ultrasound. 4 likes, 78 replies "
Globus Sensation,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/globus-feeling-after-risky-sex--669613,Globus feeling after risky sex.,"Good day, 4 months ago I had a risky sexual encounter. Penetration was done with condom, but I had unprotected oral sex (receiver). 4 days after, I had swollen tonsils without fever. 2 weeks after, a pasty white matter covered my gums like tartar but on my upper gum that disappeared after a one night fever a week after. After this I started having night sweats that lasted 1 week aprox. All theses symptoms have already gone but a globus sensation appeared in the left of my throat. The intensity varies sometimes I slightly feel it and other times I definitely feel like something stuck there and in the worst cases my right ear hurts a little bit and also the part of my neck which is under my right ear and at the joint with my jaw. Tests I took: 4ta gen. Elisa for HIV (from vein) 30, 45, 75 and 107 days after last sex activity: all non reactive 4ta gen Eclia for HIV (from vein) 60 days after: non reactive Ecography from the neck: no adenopathy seen. Laryngeal endoscopy: left part of lingual tonsil slightly swollen (nothing to worry about according to the doctor). Radiography of paranasal sinuses: slightly maxiloetmoidal sinusitis (nothing to worry about according to the doctor). Hemogram blood test: everything under appropiate parameters. Urine test: everything under appropiate parameters. ENTs tell me that my right tonsil is only slightly swollen, but it doesn't deserve antibiotics. I took deflazacort for 10 days (also azithromycin for 3 days) and it only worked while I took it and only in the mornings, at night the globus feeling came again. I don't know what else to do.

Last year i began to find something odd; that when i urinated, i would begin to feel very faint.  At times I would have to stop in the middle of it quickly, and lower myself to the floor or sit on the toilet, in order to regain my composure.  I didnt think anything of it, because i have been under stress, so i related it to that.  It also happened a few times after.   Early this year, around Feb, i recall getting up in the middle of the night because i had to void.  My stream began, but then i felt faint, seeing \""darkness\"" and feeling very strange.  Like something had come over me.  I managed to get back to my bedroom but i fell down to the floor (THUMP)... next thing i remember is crawling into my bed, and waking up in the morning to find a huge scratch on my arm, and my leg being sore. So, this \""micturition syncope\"" situation has now happened approximately 4-5 times, maybe more.. havent kept count ! Today, i awoke from an afternoon nap.  Went up the stairs to the bathroom and started to urinate.  Low and behold, it started again... feeling faint, dizzy, seeing darkness.. very very weak.... i managed to stagger into my computer room and i must have passed out because i awoke to being on the floor and my phone beeping off the hook... and i hadn't touched it so how was it now off the hook?   This is occurring more frequently now.. I do at times feel kinda fatigued, off and on some days... i thought it was stress, once again.... In the morning i am going to see my family doctor to get some answers.  Since i live alone here, with no friends nearby or family, i was so scared and frightenend.. i didnt know if i should call the ambulance or not... i just layed in my bed and prayed that i would feel better... which i did about 30 mins later... still not 100% but better than before... Now everytime I have to go to the bathroom, i'm scared it may happen again.. YIKES... Hopefully i'll get some answers tomorrow from my Dr. Regards, E. 0 likes, 27 replies "

Suggestions? ,"My story is somewhat long but I need to put it all out there to try to get some insight. I have been having the following symptoms for several years. These symptoms have drastically worsened since my knee surgery last year (MPFL Reconstruction - August 2017); Migraines Insomnia  Excessive Sweating Extreme Fatigue Joint Pain, Swelling, Stiffness & Weakness  Frequent Nasal Sores Tachycardia  Shaky Hands  Vertigo Bouts of Fainting  Flexible Joints  Bilateral Hip Bursitis  Anxiety & Depression  Foot Pain Psoriasis (Scalp & Ears) Back & Neck Pain  Bruising Hair Loss Frequent Fever Scapula Itching  I saw a Rheumatologist about 4 years ago who tested me for RA. I have a strong family history but it was negative. I was even negative for the gene. He told me that I had “chronic inflammatory disease” and “hip bursitis”. He said the bursitis was caused from me being overweight, (I was about 180 at that time). He started giving me injections every 6 months for the bursitis and prescribed Meloxicam. The Meloxicam did not help me so I do not currently take it. As far as the bursitis goes, I started doing the Keto diet and dropped down to 155 (my current weight). It has made me feel somewhat better physically but not a huge change so I not believe that weight is the factor in that.  Moving on, after I healed from my knee surgery last year, my health started to drastically decline. I told my PCP about everything that had been going on and he gave me a referral to a different Rheumatologist. My PCP suspected I may have Lupus but wasn’t sure because my labs were normal. In the mean time my PCP prescribed me Tramadol for the pain, Metoprolol for the tachycardia, Sertraline for the anxiety and Ambien for sleep. He said we would wait for me to see the Rheumatologist before he sends me to a Neurologist for the migraines and insomnia.  I waited 8 long months to see the Rheumatologist and she spent no longer than 10 minutes with me before she said I have “Fibromyalgia” and EDS/Hypermobility Syndrome. She said theres not much she can do for me.. to try yoga, meditation or cognitive behavioral therapy. She said she would do some labs, x-rays that and get back with me. The nurse called me last week and said I have Hyperthyroidism (which makes sense for the sweating issue and even fatigue) but other than that, my labs and x-rays are normal. She told me to follow up with my PCP regarding medication for the thyroid issue and possible medications I can take for the Fibromyalgia. She’s also referring me to a Dermatologist for an official diagnosis of Psoriasis. She said it COULD be possible that I could be developing Psoriatic Arthritis but she’s really not sure. I see the Dermatologist on the 21st of this month and my PCP on Monday. I hate feeling like I’m crazy! Doctors just look at you like you’re a Hypochondriac. I’m not downing Fibromyalgia but I feel like it’s is an easy diagnosis doctors throw around here and there to not have to do further testing or really look for the underlying problem. I know my body better than anyone and something more is going on. I’m 31 y/o and feel like I’m 70 most of the time. This has drastically changed my life over the past year and I just want some valid answers with some valid treatment options. I’m in debilitating pain every day. It’s hard to get out of bed because of pain, fatigue or migraines. I feel a lot of shame and guilt because of all of this. I rarely make it to work lately and my boyfriend has to pick up the slack. Coming from someone so independent, this is really hard for me.  Any suggestions, advice or opinions would be appreciated. Thanks!  0 likes, 4 replies "

I was back  and forward to the toilet and the burning and stinging was the worst I have ever had. I tried the clotramazole cream - worse I could hardly stand the pain then I tried drapoline it wasnt much better but helped a fraction.  well i contacted the doctor and would have been as well not  bothering it ended up me asking if it was because of the estriol cream and the thrush pessary and he decided it was and to wait a while before I took the estriol cream again because the thrush pessary would last up to seven days.

Only two (eminent) USA sites mention this as a reality. TWO I do wish my GP would take seriously a need to review and change my medication routine (I have been on 25mg Atenolol for ectopic beats for 9 years now), especially since I have read in several notable cardiological sites that atenolol can not only contribute to A/F but also that in any event, 25mg is too low a dose.

Eye Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/shimmering-light-after-laser-how-do-i-cope--614239,"Shimmering light after laser, how do I cope? ","Hello everyone. In need of a support group. Some people have good coping skills, however I do not. And I really need to talk to people who can relate right now. Almost 5 weeks ago I had laser barrage on the bottom of my retina (4-6 o'clock position.) I was told my lattice area was very thin and there was fluid pulling on the holes and it was best to laser it down. I was having an increase in dark floaters which is what brought me in. I was referred to a retina specialist and he wanted to do laser that day. I wish I would have thought about it more. I did feel like I was in danger at the time and that it wasn't optional to not do it. I was crying and shaking and I felt if it was optional they would have told me since I was so upset.  I asked if this would affect my vision and he said no. I asked him so many questions and it was as if there could be no complications. He had me sign a waiver for   and I knew I wouldn't be at risk since the macula was no where near where I needed laser. The first 3 weeks I was so fixated on the fact my pupil was still dilated. I was so upset by it, but now I feel it's the least of my worries. I feel my pupil is getting better but it's still not 100% back to normal. I see small strides with my pupil, but the blurry up close vision is almost back to normal. It seems like my pupil is working over time to try and go back to its normal size and position and I have faith it will make it there since I continue to see improvement.  Then the 3rd-5th week I was getting flashing lights and shimmering in my peripheral vision. The shimmering is getting noticeably worse over time. The more light I am around through out the day, the more it acts up and comes into my vision. I notice it mostly when I look down on my phone, book, or just look down in general.  I've gone back 5 times since the laser on emergency visits and I am told everything is fine and sent home every single time. I don't believe at this point I am in any danger with my retina. But the side effects are destroying me.  I'm finally going for a second opinion this week. I just fear so badly that this flickering shimmering light is never going to subside. And it keeps getting worse. I can't believe this wasn't explained to me, and I have been reading about so many others going through the same thing. This just feels so wrong to me. I feel completely failed by the healthcare system.  I'm questing everything right now. I just want to know or to have someone see this post who has gone through what I'm going through and to tell me it will get better. Yoga is the only thing getting me through this difficult time and even then it's hard to remain positive. Any coping skills would be greatly appreciated. And I really hope someone will tell me their situation has improved or give me some sort of hope. I really hope this isn't permanent.  0 likes, 9 replies "

The doctor acted as though it was very low risk and I went a long because I feared any vision loss and I didn't think there were common complications.  Since the laser a few days ago I have this blank black/gray spot in my lower peripheral. Sometimes I see it more than others like in certain lighting or if I'm moving my head a lot. Sometimes it even just looks like a little light. I told the doctor about it and she says she thinks it's from the inflammation from the laser and should resolve but there might be a chance that the spot will remain but I'll only see it if I try to look for it and most people don't notice it. I notice everything however and I am only 24 and have good peripheral vision so it's a big deal for me. I was wondering if anyone had this experience and saw the spot and over time it disappeared.

Well, good news is that my eyes are healthy.  The moment she saw me though, she said my eyelid looks puffy. Well, when she was doing the exam, she saw a blocked duct along my lashes and a white head. So, it seems to be a stye.   I have been given a hot compress eye mask to use and I have to get a topical cream that is supposed to help. I have been noticing a semi new symptom though. I told her about it and she said it is possible with a stye.  I have had some light sensitivity.  It is mild, but annoying.  It makes me paranoidas its in both of my eyes.

However, I wasn't yet familiar with ""PVD"" so I immediately went to my eye doctor.  He thoroughly examined and tested my eyes and made the diagnosis. He said there was nothing I could have done to prevent it and there is no way to treat it......except through time and nature taking its course.  He said the vitreous material will dissipate into smaller pieces as time goes by (2 to 6 months) and my brain will compensate for some of the focus problem.  The doctor said to alleviate the eye strain issue, I should shut my eyes for 10 minutes or so until the pain subsides. It's now been 3 weeks for me and I do sense some decrease in my focusing problem (especially reading/computer use) and eye strain, but the problem is still there.

Eye Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/white-flickering-light-after-laser-for-retinal-tear-516808,White flickering light after laser for retinal tear,"I posted on here a few weeks ago about a black/gray spot I kept seeing after the retinal tear laser surgery. I saw on the doctor's notes it was the photocoagulation. I also saw that I have lattice degeneration which I'm assuming contributed to the tear. I am not seeing the black spot so much anymore, unless I blink or change rooms with different lightings, but now in its place I am constantly seeing a flashing light that looks white especially in dim lighting. It extends to the side of my eye as well, which I'm assuming is from where the laser was also done. I went to the retinal specialist and said everything looked fine and this could be a side effect of the laser and it generally goes away within a couple months. I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this with the laser and if it went away? this has been very disorienting for me and I have been fearing losing my peripheral vision. I'm not sure if I am actually losing peripheral vision or if it just feels that way since I have this constant flickering now on the side. I know it's better to be safe than sorry, but a part of me wishes I never did this laser bc its been causing so many issues for me and supposedly the tear had scar tissue from healing itself.

Or do I keep waiting?,"I've worn toric   (CL) for around 18 years now without a problem. Up until a year ago, I was with Tesco Opticians, which have now been taken over by Vision Express (VE). Under Tesco I never had any concerns, and orders were always in quickly. My first VE order after the takeover took 3 months to arrive. So... I recently had a sight test at another branch (as I was working away), and was told my eyesight had worsened. New glasses... massive improvement. Left eye Cyl has changed by -0.50, and right eye by -1.25. No complaints. Now, back home, having waited over a month for the first available CL check appointment at my local VE store. It's an optician I've never seen before, but who instantly gets flustered spending the first 15 mins of the appointment searching disorganised boxed of trial lens orders for some trial lenses ordered in. That seemed strange to start with, since I had mentioned I thought a prescription change in the lenses was needed, so ordering in a different brand of lenses at the same spec seemed pointless... Anyway, no sign of the trial lenses. A quick check (look ahead, look up, look left, look right, blink) on each eye, and I'm asked to read the lowest line on the screen, one eye at a time. Left eye not amazing, right eye worse. This kind of makes sense, given the glasses prescription. He offers a pair of lenses in front and asks me to look down at a card. It's slightly clearer with. ""That's excellent"" he exclaims. ""There's been a +0.5 improvement in both eyes. It's what we're aiming for."" No further tests with lens options, no reading of the screen again. And for the first time ever, no taking out my contact lenses for a check of the health of the surface of my eye. I question the fact that the numbers from the sight test and CL check seem to contradict each other. As I'm lead out back out, he explains that the contact lenses are closer to my eyes, so need a weaker prescription. That's  always been the case (CL prescription has always been weaker than my glasses), but why on earth would they start going in opposite directions??! I now have another month wait for the next available CL check, for a fit of some trial lenses that are now a weaker prescription than I currently wear. I'm noticing I'm struggling wearing my old CL prescription, but the whole appointment felt very disorganised and a cursory look at how healthy my eyes are. I've no concerns, but know that CL suppliers are really keen on you having your eyes checked annually if you wear lenses. Have the recommended checks on contact lenses been relaxed since Dec 2017? Or have I just ended up with an optometrist who was in a rush to get home that evening? I'm not claiming to understand the numbers, but I've never know my prescriptions to start changing in opposite directions. I've no chance of a second opinion any time soon at that store (their appointment availability is ridiculous), but I live on the Isle of Wight, so there's not a huge choice of branches without getting a ferry!?

Help!,"Hi, I’m 14 and I’ve been moderately shortsited (-4.5 in the left and -4.75 in the right) for about 5/6 years now. About 3/4 weeks ago we had a thunderstorm with a lot of lighting. I walked into my kitchen which was well lit (this was in the daylight) and saw a sudden white flash in the whole of my vision, almost like somebody had just flashed a bright torch on and off infront of me quickly, I assumed it was lightning. This has happened quite a few times now and for the first probably 7 times it happened I just assumed it was lightning, and continued to assume this until I was sitting in class one day at school about 2/3 weeks ago and saw 2 little dots floating across my vision. I knew they were floaters as I have heared about them before, but I have never had any of these issues with my vision apart from shortsightedness. It worried me instantly, so went home and researched all about them. I am aware they could be harmless but I have a very bad feeling about it, and have seen that if you’re experiencing floaters along with the flashes, there could be something wrong. At first it was occasional small floaters and flashes, but they’ve gotten increasingly and rapidly worse.  It’s been sunny lately so we’ve been outside barbecuing and what not, and these floaters just won’t leave me alone! I now see them everywhere, even when looking at peoples faces or reading in places that aren’t even well lit! (although they’re usually more visible when I’m somewhere bright, eg looking at the sky) I continue to see them in all lighting now. And not to mention they’re really big now and I just can’t go a single day without seeing at least 40/50. They can be the strangest shapes too. (Lines/squiggles/swirls/clumps/circles/mounds etc) I’ve had GCSE’s in school these past 2 weeks and can’t concentrate becuase I just see floaters drifting across my paper and the wall. I see strange things too, almost like strange dark shapes just floating around (they’re not floaters), mostly in my prephiral vision. Back to the flashes, once I had researched floaters I noticed that they’re sometimes paired with ‘flashes of light’, this is when I noticed that that is what I was experiencing. Sometimes I will see full vision flashes as previously explained but now, they’re mostly little flashing white or black dots (sometimes the black dots pulsate in my left eye) in my vision. I am experiencing eye pain occasionally. I noticed that for the past 6 months, my eyesight is getting rapidly worse, I know this is normal for teens but I’m talking about seriously rapidly: I recieved new, stronger glasses approximately 5/6 months ago, and just under 2 months later my shortsightedness had gotten even worse by 3 steps!! This is now happening frequently. For about 4 months now, I have suffered with bad night vision, where I walked into my room in the dark one evening and saw that I was seeing more than double of the light on my digital light up clock (the numbers light up). This also got increasingly worse and I now experience severe glare and haloes, and also the triple vision and glare of light constantly, not just in the dark, but even in full daylight. For example, if I look at a street lamp I will see huge white lines coming out of it, or if there are subtitles on a screen I will see multiple of them. I recently went to the optician to explain these glare issues etc (I had not yet experienced the flashes or floaters) who said she wasn’t sure what was wrong, gave me stronger glasses and said to go to the doctor if symptoms persist/get worse. They did! I went to the doctor who didn’t do any tests on my eyes (this was at the stage when I still thought the flashes were lightning, so I only mentioned the glare/ double vision of light) and he just asked me to read something, sat me down and booked me an appointment with the ophthalmologist at the hospital. It is since then my symptoms of floaters and flashes have been revealed and everything is getting worse by the day. I have no idea when my ophthalmologist appointment is and have been waiting for a little while now. I don’t know what to do! It’s really affecting me. Something that’s also happening is I sometimes see a dark shadow/ circle just fly across my vision (not floaters) at any time. They can be white or black, but usually black. I can sometimes see a shower of flashing white dots in my vision and I know that all of this is very abnormal for my age. I can feel that something is wrong, I’m just not sure what!? Does anyone have any ideas/suggestions? Is this serious? Should I try to push for my ophthalmologist appointment? My Grandad has glaucoma, but my optician tested for that and I do not have it.

My peak flow was 400, and previously it was slightly higher but not by much, but she suggested we try this anyway to see what happens.

Asthma,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/is-it-asthma--656530,Is it asthma?,"Hi, I’m 25 years old and never had any obvious reasons to believe I had asthma.  But about 6 months ago I woke up in the night very wheezy and short of breath. I was coughing for about 45 mins to an hour before I could finally get back to sleep. It was very scary as it felt like I was breathing through a straw and if it went any tighter I don’t think I’d have been able to breathe at all. This happened again twice but about 4 weeks apart each time so I went to the doctors and they gave me a blue asthma pump and said to use it as and when I felt I need it.  I didn’t use it for a while and wondered if I ever would but the ‘attacks’ did come back.  Now I’m finding I’m using the pump about once a week but the only thing I find strange is that it always happens when I’m asleep? The pump does help and relaxes my airways. I continue to cough but it feels more loose and I feel much better very quickly whereas if I didn’t use the pump it could take about an hour to feel better.  Every time I’ve used my pump I’ve only had to use it once until earlier this week I found I had to use it twice. And last night I felt like it didn’t provide much relief at all.  If I ever sneeze I find I feel a bit wheezy and tight chested after so wonder if it could be allergies? But I have never suffered with allergies before.  I am going to make an appointment to see my doctor as he said to go back if I find I need to use it regularly but just wondering if anyone has these symptoms and know what I might have? 0 likes, 6 replies "

I've already emailed my doc and will go in soon, but in the meantime, any words of comfort??? I'm freaking out a little; I also have an anxiety disorder which flares up when I have health concerns.  Will I still be able to exercise? Will this go away as I lose weight? Is it even asthma, or just the reflux plus the remnants of a really awful virus this spring? I know my doc needs to answer all these things and I promise I'll see her, but I'm hoping you all can just help reassure me in the meantime.  No one on my family has asthma so I know nothing about it, which makes it extra scary.

I saw a doctor when this first started and was prescribed with Montelukast SOD 5 Mg ( Singulair ), Pulmicort, and Dulera 200 mcg-5 mcg/actuation HFA aerosol inhaler , but none of those helped me.

( Not just like an  irregular heartbeat that some people mention when in afib. Literally unbearable. Rang an ambulance and wad taken to a resuscitation unit where they were going to cardiovert me where I spontaneously cardioverted on my own after an hour and a half of being in this unbearable discomfort. Since then I have been on 5mg Bisoprolol once daily and 100mg Flecainide twice daily for my AF AND PVC's have been pretty much kept at bay for that amount of time apart from 3 AF episodes which have only lasted a matter of a minute or so. (again unbearable pressure/tightness) Had an episode yesterday lasting a good 5 minutes and am so worried that the medication is going to stop working and that I'm going to die really young when I've got so much too look forward too as people normally only get this when they get older 😢 I get a similar sinking/adrenaline feeling like when I'm in AF when bending over or lying down so don't know if this is related to my heart aswell. Have been put on sertraline due to   as have had since christmas a constant chest tightness/sinking feelings/dropping in an elevator feelings that I can only say feels like my previous heart symtpms and now the AF episode that lasted 5 mins so am convinced something bad going to happen cus of how horrendous it feels even though I've had good bloods back and a chest x ray am still convinced that this isn't anxiety. I am literally in hell. I did have a cardiac MRI around the time of my diagnosis of AF with a structurally normal heart but i do smoke and drink so feel that I might of screwed up to much since then and ruined my chances of living much longer with the AF coming back and me having all of these ' anxiety related symptoms' (Not Convinced) Any replies would be appreciated lovely people 0 likes, 7 replies "

Then 2yrs ago she had internal bleeding from a stomach ulcer, and has been anemic since then. For her anemia, she was given a blood transfusion, and then a week later had a clot in her leg, which was resolved with blood thinners. 2 months ago she had a temperature of 91F, and at the hospital they discovered that she was in and out of a-fib, and might have a leaky mitral valve.

Most notably, I've had gastritis-like symptoms, including bloating, wind, stomach discomfort and reflux, which often comes with a sort of 'lump in the throat'/tightness in my throat that comes and goes. It can be helped a little bit by esomeprazole or ranitidine, and I'll often take wind-eze for the bloating. The worse symptom for me though, is the shortness of breath. My private physician believed this was caused by the reflux but I'm still experiencing it without reflux symptoms and it's also become slightly worse since I last spoke with him. We've looked at a number of causes, I'm had a whole host of blood tests, chest x-ray, spirometry, heart echo and CT scan of neck, chest and abdominal. Only thing of note was some small abnormalities on my liver which the doctor performing was not concerned about. Said it's likely just cysts. I've taken it upon myself to undergo a - mostly - gluten-free diet, I'm drinking lacto-free milk, mostly avoiding alcohol (and drinking gluten-free beer on the rare occasions I have a few). The same GP I'm seeing has diagnosed me with general autoimmune disorder.

Initially, I felt better for a few days but then it's almost like I crashed 3-4 days later. Breathing became worse, along with other symptoms. At this point, I'm not sure what the next step will be. My GP diagnosed me with a general autoimmune disorder, as I don't exactly 'fit' any specific one (I believe) but my symptoms have become pretty debilitating.

Autoimmune Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/does-this-sound-autoimmune-thoughts--682791,Does this sound autoimmune? Thoughts?,"Hi there, I’ve had an odd constellation of symptoms lately that my doctor can’t seem to figure out. I was wondering if anyone out there had any thoughts or similar experiences. I’ve had intermittent joint pain since early childhood but was always told that was “growing pains”. There was never any obvious swelling so other than an X-ray no testing was done and this was eventually attributed to my being overweight. I could understand that but I did always wonder why it started when I was so young, and not overweight at the time. The joint pain continued into adulthood but was manageable with Motrin so I never pushed the issue with my physician. About 3 months ago the joint pain became significantly worse, occurred with greater frequency, and began to involve my hips, shoulders, hands, and even elbows at times. I also developed overwhelming fatigue. I was exhausted all the time. There were times I had to force myself out of bed to even eat something and I often felt like I was too tired to even chew. I’d never experienced anything like it. My doctor ran a few labs including a CBC with differential, CRP, ESR, and checked for Lyme because I live in a high risk area. Lyme came back negative. CBC showed WBC of 12.4 with high neutrophils. The CRP was slightly elevated at 15.9 and ESR was elevated at 31. It wasn’t clear what was going on but we decided a wait and see approach was best. Two weeks later I developed a peri rectal abscess which required an I&D under anesthesia and 3 days of IV antibiotics. My WBC count at that time were 19.6 again with high neutrophils. The wound healed without issue and the area was showing no signs of infection however 2 weeks post op I was still having low grade fevers and my WBC count remained elevated at 13. My doctors said it would likely just take time to recover from the infection but they did start another course of antibiotics. 2 weeks later my WBC count was still above 13 and my CRP was 15.9.  It has now been 2 months since the infection and operation and I’m still having the same joint aches and overwhelming fatigue. They seem to be getting worse and not better. My white count is still high (13.8) as is my CRP (mildly high). I had an ANA done and it came back negative. I just don’t feel right and I can’t figure it out. I keep catching colds which is abnormal for me because I hardly ever got sick before. I’ve always had GI issues which were worked up and deemed IBS and solitary rectal ulcer syndrome. Those symptoms have been more troubling lately as well. My PCP referred me to a rheumatologist however I won’t be able to get in to see her until January. My doctor is very amenable to ordering any lab tests I think might help but I really don’t have any experience with this stuff. If anyone has any recommendations in terms of lab work or testing it would be greatly appreciated. I’d like to get as much as I can done before January 1st since I’ve met my insurance out of pocket max for the year and it would all be covered at this point.

The pain did not subside, so I went back to the ER and was told that I had  . I got an appendectomy, but the pain in the stomach continued. I went to a GI doctor at Penn, and had numerous tests done - Upper tract with small intestine follow through,  , endoscopy, small camera swallowing test, nuclear medicine x-ray, etc. The doctors concluded that I had GERD. This was over a 6 month span. At times, the pain was so bad that I would not be able to move - with movement, it was a sharp pain in the middle of the stomach area. Again, I went to the ER and was told it was endometriosis. I had a follow up with GYN and was told that was incorrect. The stomach issues somehow resolved itself and subsided. March of 2018, I was back in the emergency room with a swollen nose (under the bridge of the nose) and unable to open my eye. CT scan showed chronic sinusitis and I was sent to Wills Eye for my right eye. IT was bright red, tearing, and in incredible amounts of pain. I was diagnosed with scleritis. They started me on flurbiprofen and drops in the eyes, but it was not going away, so I was put on 60 mg of prednisone. I was on this for about three months (tappered off). In the midst of this, I went to rheumatology and was put on methotrexate. I had a horrible reaction so then put on imuran. I am now off of prednisone, my eye is okay, and taking imuran. I now how horrible pains that move around in my hands, sometimes two fingers on left hand, other days, the whole right hand. It feels like my fingers are broken and I have trouble washing myself, dressing myself, etc. Most recently, it moved to my ankles, causing me to have to stay in bed and unable to walk. I have been on imuran, and was told to just take 2400mg of ibuprofen (3 times a day, 800mg) when I was having these 'flare-ups'. The ibuprofen helps, but then the pain will come back.  I am 24 years old, do not drink or take recreational drugs. I was in great health and very active prior to the March 2017 Curacao trip.

Even at a relatively good school, I've found ways to struggle.  At this particular place, I couldn't figure out how to teach the curriculum. I didn't understand the lesson plans (it was only seventh grade English), and I often prepared and taught lessons that were probably over the students' heads. I also didn't use proper engagement techniques. They eventually put an aide in the classroom with me and gave her all of the teaching responsibilities. I feel terrible about all of this. Here I am with a master's degree, and I can't do my job. What is wrong with me?  This and other failed employment experiences make me wonder if I could ever be gainfully employed at all. I sometimes just don't know how to relate to people. I'm afraid or unsure how to ask questions in training situations, so I miss the information I need. I'm not always sure how to explain things so that they are less complicated.

Over the last couple of years I've picked up on things which I feel aren't normal (That's probably the wrong way of putting it...I should say different from other children.) I know all children aren't the same, but I feel if I don't act now this could have a big impact on her life. Not sure where to go for help. Firstly my child is so loving, caring, very friendly and trustworthy. She shows empathy by the bucket loads and anyone going through a difficult time she feels this. So much so certain situations can reduce her to tears. Shes very emotional and even opening a Xmas present she gets very overwhelmed and cries. Socially she wants to get along with everyone and struggles at school when children are horrible, she'll get emotional and can't understand Why? Nor can she walk away, she will keep going back until she is accepted. In terms of work I've noticed how messy her work is in books etc, she's easily distracted and doesn't have the patience to complete work. Homework is a nightmare usually spend a whole day trying to get her to do her work, even then we have to sit and go through everything for her to understand. Maths is a massive struggle she can't understand maths questions in written form and every question has to be broken down. With long multiple questions sometimes she'll forget what she's actually doing. I've brought this up the last three years at school as maths is a real issue and all I get is she's fine in class.  She has always been sensitive to noise, loud bangs and anything unusal will make her panic and worry what it is?! She still wets the bed on and off especially if she is worried amd anxious about something.  In terms of behaviour she is well behaved but struggles when it comes to playing a board game or anything fun will soon turn to tears and a melt down. Also I've noticed more so lately that if I give her 2/3 instructions  she can't seem to follow them all through and will forget what I've asked her to do. Getting changed is a nightmare she doesn't like labels, tags on clothes and anything tight she hates and won't wear.  This will then cause another melt down.  She likes routine and seems to do the same thing over and over again. For example: watch the same film/programme, look over family videos and pictures over and over again!!! We struggle going shopping or for a meal etc as she will soon get fed up  and say people are irritating her. Can anyone give me some advice as to where I go from here please.

I was so happy, I had this huge crush on him and I felt that it was reciprocal. We have been fine, more than fine, everything was perfect, in the last few weeks. I do not now if I was ever so in love... The problem is that I have a major depression, diagnosed  a few years ago. I was truly in a bad place, dark thoughs everyday over my head, a vision of the future completely dark, and I felt that nothing was worth to live. With a lot of help from family and friends, a lot of medication and therapy, new purposes in life, I was able to find happiness again. I still have my negative polar moments, but usually I am able to controll them and get around. When they come it is horrible, but it is manageble. My boyfriend has asperger, he told me in the day after we start dating. We was expecting that I would freak out, and gave me a tight hug when I told him that it do not make look at him differently. I told him that I have depression, he told me that it was ok. He have his ""quirks"", but nothing that I could not manage, or tolerate or even embrace. I actually adore him, during the last few years I did not believe that it would be possible after everything that went wrong with my ex. The problem is that I am in a negative cycle again. I know that this will eventually go away, but I am scared. Last night I was feeling anxious, so I called him and I explained what I was feeling. I asked him to talk about something, anything that he would like, until the medication started to function. I felt like he was trying to ""dispatch"" me (I do not know if this is an expression, english is not my native language), he was like ""Sweety, do you think you are able to sleep now?"" constantly... I ended up saying that I was ok and ended the call. And I had a panic attack. Followed by other. And yet another. I felt abandoned, it has been an year and a half since my last panic attack... I thought that if I was able to explain that I was hurting and be explicit about what I needed from him it would be easy, but for some reason the resquest for help and the feeling of desinterst from him, ended to hurt me more. I do not understand if the problem is the asperger or the perception of the depression. I know thas aspies have problems about being empathic, or maybe I just interrupted something that he was focused. But at the same time I do not know what he really thinks about depression... He actually never metions it, and sometimes I am afraid that he is one of those persons that think that I am just being ""whiny"". It is true that this was a single episode, but my dark side cannot stop imagine the dark future: it will be always like this? I am still trying to understand asperger, but it has been very difficult to me. Do you have any advice? Do you know if it is possible for us to find an equilibrium? I like him very much, I cannot see myself ending the realtionship, but I also know that I hurt everyone around me when I cannot control my demons. And I don't want to hurt him If you have any advice I would be thankful   0 likes, 0 replies "

Got diagnosed with high-functioning autism 2 years ago. After a lifelong struggle of my quest for the answer: why do i feel different and whats wrong with me. As a kid i loved to play with Lego, was very strict with what i liked and how people around me should behave. If i did not like something, i said it in a rude way, without understanding the social rudeness. I had a strong melancholic feeling all my life. My emotions are difficult to explain. I dwell deeply into every endeavor I undertake. From sports to music and writing. Besides my autism, I have all my life struggled with anxiety and bouts of  . My biggest issue is the social aspect. I have a hard time listening, paying attention to others and feeling empty. This has led me to probably the worst part of my autism: no true deep relationship with females, meaning no girlfriends. I often feel lonely and escape from this world into my musical world. Because writing music gives relief and relates my anxiety. I’m a deeply emotional person. I love dogs and children. But adult interactions drains me and makes me emotional. MY mind is 90% music. probably to the level of OCD. This of course is affecting all social interactions. I hate small talk and only talk about a narrow selection of topics. Mostly music. Social interactions are draining for me. But my quest for love is an endless quest it seems. This has made me shut down internally from time to time. With the frustration of lack of love, intimacy, and hugs from females. Online dating works but it is the real world social interactions that drain. After a while the dates gets boring and my mind gets filled with music. I have no issues getting dates. But still, I feel unexcited. Mostly because interactions take too much energy. So its a paradox.  I have close friends and no problems getting acquaintances.  But lack of love and female affection is killing my soul. I feel like I will remain alone.

So are they implying that Autism can be cured and that it is not a disability because of this? So then what is a disability and what is a difference between a disability and a disorder? I have come to learn that the NHS are trying to cut budget savings by lessening the amount of support they offer to Autistics by using the excuse that it is not a disability so it doesn’t hardly need any funding.  I have seen many of my services cut that I used to use and now I am fending for myself because of the NHS. I have seen children with Autism talk about how they can no longer get support due to the cuts. It’s really horrible. I want to hear everyone’s thought on this. Thanks, Sammy 0 likes, 7 replies "

Anyway, since a couple of months ago my 5 year old asks the same question multiple times a day, every day ""how many more days till my birthday?""  It's in November.  So he then asks ""is that 5 days?"" Or he'll hold his hands up and ask is it this long till my birthday?"" He then starts to get upset if he can't understand.  Another question he's repeating but not as much is ""when do we go on holiday?"" He'll then ask the two smaller questions exactly the same as with his birthday question.   He's also started making lots of funny little noises over and over again.  He's constantly moving around, biting his toenails or sucking on his toes.  He has angry outbursts and cries slot-gets distressed when something's missing from his school bag.  There's so much I could write.  Should I have him assessed? My husband isn't convinced.  His teacher says he's just shy.  He's average for reading and writing but very good with maths and science based learning. 1 like, 1 reply "

For example, I didn't think I was ever assigned a mentor teacher, because my principal didn't call her that. I refused to ask questions because I thought I was bugging people or drawing attention to my own incompetence, I had a lot of trouble relating to the kids, etc.  Obviously, teaching isn't something I'm cut out for given my disorder. I'm in my 30's, though, and I would like to find an area of competency that will help me support myself and pay off my student loans.  I signed up for help through the vocational rehabilitation center, but I still have this nagging fear that they won't find a good match for me.  0 likes, 1 reply "

She has selective mutism since basically she’s been able to speak. However after a lot of intervention she has now in the last year started to talk and for the first time to teachers. What is concerning me now though is that there are clearer signs she may indeed be on the spectrum, I have suspected for a while but SM displays very similar traits.  She has very low empathy , she doesn’t get a lot of what she watches on tv especially humour, social skills are difficult even with her friends , team games she cannot deal with and the most recent thing is she has started hand flapping - she may have been doing this a while for it’s been most recent that I have noticed it. It seems to be when excited but I have also noticed when she writes she seems to be twitching her other hand repeatively.  Just thought this was strange to come up now at her age ?

Autonomic Dysfunction,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/possible-pots-please-help--674309,Possible PoTs? Please help...,"Hi all. I am coming to this discussion group hoping for some clarity. I am a 22 year old female who has had her life turned upside down for almost 2 years. I’ve spent every day since my first attack sobbing and begging for answers and for someone to believe me.  Here is my story. December of 2016 I woke up believing I was having a heart attack. My heart rate spiked and I couldn’t breathe right. I started throwing up and got extremely dizzy. I went to the ER and they concluded it was anxiety. Many episodes later, I have been into the ER seven times, seen a neurologist, cardiologist, and my GP numerous times. The amount of tests I have had done is insane. I’ve tried wholistic medicine, had a spinal tap, tilt table test, multiple heart monitors, head MRI and CT, countless blood tests, and an ecocrdiogram of my heart.  They didn’t find anything. Basically every doctor has yelled at me saying it is anxiety and to accept it. But how to do accept an answer that you honestly feel is wrong? I know my body, and I know that this isn’t anxiety... Here is a list of my symptoms: 1. Fast heart rate suddenly (but not always when I am standing, sometimes sitting)  2. GI problems  3. Nausea  4. Diharrea  5. Lightheaded  6. Dizzy  7. Brain fog  8. Headache/head pressure  9. Joint/muscle pain  10. Extreme fatigue (especially when my heart rate goes very low...I will explain that in a second)  11. Random bruises    And the list goes on. It all started with a fast heart rate that woke me in the middle of the night, and those were the episodes that happened for a long time. However, recently it isn’t a fast heart rate, but rather a slow one. Even when I’m awake it drops to like 48... The lowest it has dropped to was 44 when I was sleeping. I went to see my cardiologist who didn’t seem concerned at all, but another doctor was. This is when I first heard about the condition know was PoTs. When reading into it, I was SO SUPRISED with how similar not only my symptoms were but the stories I have read about those who have it. The only thing that doesn’t line up is my now slow heart rate. However, I have read a couple of places that this can happen with PoTs, but I am not sure if it is true. This is the interesting part though. I read that a lot of women notice that their symptoms worsen on their period. And I noticed that every time I have been to the ER, I was on my period.  I talked to a doctor about my pervious tilt table to double check to see if there was anything noted, and there was but it was very small.  Now I am wondering if this could be the answer I have been searching for. The light in all the darkness. I am wondering if anyone has had something similar, or has any input! The only thing that doesn’t make sense is my low heart rate now rather than high which causes me to be extremely tired and disconnected. My legs and feet feel so heavy all of the time and all I want to do is lay in bed because I feel like my heart can’t take it anymore.  I am begging for an answer, some hope, and soon a diagnosis so I can stop living in fear of dying at the age of 22. I have tried to be as positive and hopeful but when going through something this awful with no help or answers, how do you have hope... My life changed in a matter of a single night and has taken away some of the best things from me. I’ve lost some friends, family, part of my schooling, work, and hope.  Can someone enlighten me on this?  0 likes, 11 replies "

So I guess I should start by saying I’m a 22 year old Caucasian female and am fairly healthy aside from living with anxiety/panic attacks and GERD. This started 2 weeks ago on a Saturday when I was hungover I was out for dinner and as I was walking out of the restaurant I had this feeling in my head and felt a faint spell come on and was convinced I was going to the ground (felt like I was being pulled to the floor, lightheaded yet heavy squeezing feeling) but I didn’t faint, I just went home and slept it off .. felt fine the next day until I dinner time again when I was walking around making dinner and the exact same faint attack came on so I went and laid down for the rest of the night.  Went to the doctors on Monday she said she believed it could be related to my GERD and also did bloodwork and some other basic tests. For the rest of the week I was fine until Friday noon time, I was sitting on the computer at work and it suddenly came on again and caused a panic attack as well. I had to get picked up from work and was super dizzy, short of breath, nauseas and sweaty. Laying down seems to make it better, so I was doing that till I got up and grabbed a shower was getting dressed then had another faint feeling in the same day (same Friday I left work) so I went to the Emergency Room. Doctor said my bloodwork, vitals and ECG was fine so I just got sent to a general internal medicine clinic for the next week.  But things have only got worse from here    The next morning I woke up with skull crushing head pressure (all over head, base of skull, top of head, temples etc.) that makes my brain feel like it’s floating around in my head and pushing into my skull.. may I add my appetite has been completely off since Friday (31st of August) so I feel weak too. The head pressure was so bad that I felt like my head was being lifted up off of my neck then being pushed from the top/back (really such an uncomfortable feeling). When I stand or sit up right/eat for too long my head starts to have the faint feelings again and I got warm flushes, my hands and feet go cold and I’m legit wet with sweat.. it feels like I’m about to drop to the floor and die (BUT I never actually end up fainting). I started noticing other symptoms come on that are just disabling.. the pressure started going into my forehead, nose, face and really hard on my jaw and teeth (truly feels like they’re being pushed and squeezed) I just felt so disoriented like my head was going to pop and wasn’t a part of the rest of my body, the dizziness was bad, I truly have been laying down for over a week now. The worst I noticed was sometimes when I’m eating I notice my whole head face and mouth and like down to my neck would go numb and feel like I was floating and then the panick and faint would come back followed by the hot flush and sweating (so so scary). I don’t have confusion or loss of vision or double/blurry vision.. the dizziness doesn’t necessarily feel like vertigo it feels more internal as opposed to things around me spinning. Not extremely sensitive to light.. only a little bit to noise. I went back to the ER again and got more done (CT scan, more bloodwork and vitals) all came back perfect.  I also saw the specialist at the GIM clinic and again didn’t know what was wrong with me but reckoned it was migraine related vertigo. So I tried Advil and the vertigo medication (neither worked) and I actually ended up really sick (dry heaving, closed my eyes and felt like I had the spins from booze) wasn’t sure if this was the medication or added symptoms to what was already going on but either way I went to see my family doctor the next day who said it could be an inner ear infection so she prescribed me a nose spray and amoxicillin (antibiotics) but it’s been like 4 days and nothing has improved which worries me!!! I have no idea what’s going on I am crying and having anxiety everyday Does anyone have any idea what this could be I am losing hope and worrying this won’t go away PLEASE help    (Some additional symptoms- tingling in lips and face and ears.

Autonomic Dysfunction,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/can-beta-blockers-cause-autonomic-dysfunction--625611,Can Beta Blockers cause Autonomic Dysfunction? ,"I was perfectly fit and well until end of last December when they put me on a small dosage of the Beta Blocker Bisoprolol due to ectopic heart beats that developed into Ventricular Tachycardia. As soon as I started taking them, I described myself as being turned into an old man overnight who could no longer feel my lungs working, like a drunk zombie. When they found me in a state of near collapse at work with a heart beat after oxygen given, of only 42bpm, they declared I was allergic to beta blockers and I have not taken any since March. The symptoms however remain to this day and all the doctors, GPs, cardiologists, they refuse to even consider that beta blockers are to blame and so attribute my illness to anxiety from an abused childhood. I do not feel anxious, I have worked for over 40 years with no symptoms of anxiety until the day they put me on beta blockers which seems to be a bit too much of a co-incidence. Beta blockers however, they block adrenaline receptors in your Autonomic Nervous System, so I have symptoms of disruption to my ANS following taking medicine that not only disrupts your ANS, but that I reacted badly too. This seems rather more a logical reason for my current sickness, but how can I get anybody to even investigate the possibility?, they have all told each other it is anxiety so of course I cannot get past this presupposition. I have found a detailed description of Autonomic Dysfunction on the Dantest site, they make medical machinery for the study of such. they list causes of Autonomic Neuropathy including medications that include "" Drugs that decrease sympathetic activity (sympatholytics): alpha and beta blockers (i.e. metoprolol), barbiturates, anesthetics"", but of course I would simply be told to not believe things I read on the web! In addition, I possibly have a genetic predisposition to this as I have a Maternal cousin with Fibroid-Mialgia and Paternal half-sister with the same symptoms as POTs. My current symptoms are ectopic beats and palpitations that occur mainly later in the day when I get tired, and after eating that can get so that every other heart beat is an ectopic. My heart rate is around 30bpm faster than it used to be in any given situation, it also seems to fluctuate wildly doing the same activity. Horrendous heartburn and the feeling that my esophagus is closed so that if I eat half what I used to, it feels painful, I feel full up with just a few mouthfuls. My sense of hunger and thirst are diminished, a few weeks back I did a little experiment, I didn't eat a single thing for 42 hours and still didn't feel hungry.   Breathlessness and the feeling my lungs do not work automatically. When I talk to people now I sometimes forget to breath and they suddenly see me stop to take a gasp, when I fall asleep I keep waking with a gasp as I forget to breath. My cardiologist did arrange a lung function test, but this only measured the capacity of my lungs, it didn't measure the lungs gaseous diffusion efficiency. I had noticed when in hospital that the machine kept beeping because even awake, my blood oxygen level would fall to 87% So I bought my own Oximeter, sometimes it can be as high as 98%, so there is obviously nothing mechanically wrong with my lungs, but generally it is in the low 90s when relaxing, when I go to sleep however, it spends half the night at 85% I read that the ANS detects a low oxygen level in your blood and automatically adjusts your breathing. An eighth month old cough. They tried me on a different beta blocker, Salotolol, this right away put me into a coughing frenzy so my GP told me to come off which I did, the bad cough went right away, but I have been left with a permanent dry cough that gets worst when I talk of when I have a shower it gets so I am nearly vomiting.  Exhaustion, utter exhaustion, I had to go to work to see O/H and chatted to a few friends, so I was there for about four hours, then I had a meal there, that must have used the last of my energy as I could muster up just enough energy to draw breath, had to sit down for a couple of hours before I could get up again. All my symptoms are worst when tired, so I have to spend the following day in bed after doing anything as strenuous as going out. I don't even have the mental energy to pass my time with computer games, often it is hard to force myself to do anything more than just sit and look at the floor. Brain Fog, when I get exhausted my speech becomes slurred, I cannot walk straight and feel drunk, I have this all the time to a lesser extent. Tingling in my feet, often when lying in my bed this expands to a quivering I feel throughout my whole body. I now find myself waking in the night in order to urinate, as much as four times, full loads not a prostate trouble load. I do not have the POTs symptom, I measured my heart rate as only going up by 20bpm when standing from lying down.       2 likes, 28 replies "

Autonomic Dysfunction,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/diagnosed-with-pots-syndrome-676789,Diagnosed with POTS syndrome,"Recently I’ve been diagnosed with POTS Syndrome. I recall having a few of what I call “spells” in my teen years (I am now in my 20’s). The spells almost seem like low blood glucose: faint feeling, foggy head, pouring cold sweat, dizzy, feeling faint. The low blood glucose, along with other things was ruled out with lab work. Recently it just struck and would not go away. Along with horrid, I am dying right now take me to an ER anxiety. I told my doctor it was like my fight or flight response would not turn off. That’s when I found out about POTS. He started me on metoprolol tart. 25 mg 3 times a day. The first few days I felt like a normal person. No symptoms at all. Now the dizziness and sweating is slowly creeping back with any physical activity. I’ve only been taking the Metoprolol for 4 days, and it has helped a ton. I wonder if I will still continue to see improvements? Or maybe my body has adjusted to this dosage and I need to go higher? Along with the symptoms disappearing in the first few days, I noticed my resting heart rate was actually in the low to mid 70’s! Now it’s back up in the 90’s.

I am a 21 year old girl, never any health problems and nothing of this sort runs in my family. One day at the beginning of June 2018 I woke up with terrible bloating and digestive issues after taking ibuprofen/aleve for a couple of weeks. I thought this was fluke as this has happened before, and I figured after a couple of days I would go back to normal. Nothing went back to normal and weird bowel movements still persisted. I thought I was facing some sort of IBD so I had a colonoscopy (all clear) endoscopy (all clear) - no H-pylori, no celiac disease nothing. Had full blood panel, thyroid tested, screened for auto-immune diseases, lyme, CT scan, all negative all NORMAL. At the beginning of July it escalated to the point of where I now never feel hunger I constantly feel full, it's been almost 4 months of feeding myself food. This is terribly stressful as I am in college and everyone wants to go out and eat and I feel as if that has been stolen from me. On top of all of this my heart rate has also been a major issue. Whatever has been going on has seemed to induce POTs syndrome like symptoms in my body. Laying my HR is at 60-75, standing it shoots up to 120-140, 160 on some mornings. I live in Florida and I used to LOVE the heat, now I can barely stand going outside because of whatever has been going on in my body. I haven't fainted which I am thankful for, but my symptoms appeared out of THIN air and I am so frustrated as to why and or how I have developed these mystery symptoms. I have an appointment with an Electrophysiologist tomorrow and I am demanding more testing and if he needs to send me to further specialists I will gladly go. I feel as if I am at the end of my rope and all of these symptoms are due to some genetic/point mutation in my body as it is unexplained. I'm not sure how to deal with forcing myself food for the rest of my life, or not being able to enjoy the outdoors/beach any more. This is the definition of living hell for a girl who is 21 years old to be going through such a bizarre unexplained illness or set of symptoms. If ANYONE has any sort of information and or tips/help to provide for me please do. I am at a complete loss and seeing all my friends enjoy day to day activities and go out on the weekends absolutely breaks my heart as I used to be the most happy/outgoing girl with everything ahead of me, and now I have the worst anxiety because I feel like a total freak and no one will ever want to be with someone so troubled.

The Second episode was when he was at work, he was out cold until the paramedics arrived. The third episode was when I was giving birth to our second daughter (although I know that’s not uncommon) unfortunately on this occasion he fell so heavily he fractured the back of his skull and was in hospital for a few days. The fourth episode was this morning, he got up to urinate and after going, felt hot so went to splash his face with water. He felt faint and managed to get himself onto the floor before he fell down.  Each time I have seen him immediately after fainting he is sweating profusely, slurring his words and is taking longer to come round each time. His HR this morning went down to 44bpm. After his second episode, we decided to get it investigated. He was seen by a cardiologist and a neurologist. He’s had multiple tests done over the years like ECG’s, Bloods, MRI, CT, EEG, and a Tilt Table Test. All of which came back normal.   Consultants couldn’t come to a conclusion as to why he faints, and said perhaps he’s just a fainter. Surely there is a reason why he faints?

I also remember my breath slowing down. I struggle not to “fall asleep” and try to keep my fluttering eyes open. I can feel my breathing being heavy and slow, I was sort of gasping for air. I manage to come back to normal and ask my husband what he was saying and if anything happened because for those short few seconds/minutes (I honestly have no clue how long this went on for in reality-to me it felt like a while) I couldn’t clearly recall what he had said. During this time, his words sounded very distant and then eventually I couldn’t hear anything. He asked me if I was OK.

I know i have been dealing with anxiety after I lost my ex to  . I became so stressed and anxious about my health which eventually lead to my first panic attack. Fast forward to may of this year the panic attacks became more frequent, I was dealing with tension in my chest and convinced myself I had angina and would have a heart attack if I worked out. One day I worked out and had the most intense panic attack ever, I was certain I was going to die. Since then I've been obsessed with checking my pulse and blood pressure having panic attacks regularly. I had my heart checked by a cardiologist had test ran and all was ok minus bp spikes from anxiety.  Here is where things start to not look like anxiety. Off and on after I'd had a panic attack or a full day of anxiety, my resting heart rate sometimes remain high for days or return to normal, however, when I stand, my hear jumps to 140 - 160 and slows to 120. I start getting really bad tension headache and blurred vision. I am not anxious when it happens or am not thinking about anything upsetting. This reaction last for weeks after I'd a panic attack. As if my sympathetic nervous system is stuck on.  This only started recently after I was diagnosed with panic disorder. I know they aren't panic attacks because my attacks are brought on by an obsession like thinking my bp us high and I check it and its high then I panic. Or feel a twitch in my stomach then I panic.  I checked my bp when standing and my bp doesn't really change much. It might go up if I panic but otherwise it remains pretty steady. But my hear increases way beyond what is normal.  Is this some form of pots? Can panic and anxiety cause dysautonomia? Or is it that due to overstimulation from all the stress, panic and anxiety, my sympathetic nervous system is responding innapropriately? I can't do anything without my heart racing and its really uncomfortable and hard to live like this.  0 likes, 2 replies "

I started to get this feeling of internal vibration when I was mainly lying in bed and then occasionally if I shifted position it might last for 30 seconds or so before disappearing. That was about 8 months ago. Now I feel it every night and during the day as well quite often. The other day after a short walk of a few hundred yards followed by a period of standing still it felt like the ground was vibrating  because it was in my feet. It seems to move around to different areas of the body - sometimes I feel it in my legs, an arm, torso - it's quite random but often felt when I've shifted position in bed. At first I thought it was circulatory but now I think it's probably neurological. I thought I was having   but an ECG showed nothing abnormal. I've also had a full spine & brain MRI as I've been having other strange symptoms of occasional numbness and sensations of burning and cold areas of my arms/hands and legs/feet and a sore tongue which comes and goes and often feels like I've just cleaned my teeth with menthol toothpaste when I haven't. I thought I had all the signs of MS, but it hasn't been diagnosed. I've also had a number of   for immune issues, evoked potentials and nerve conductivity tests. Nothing! The MRI does show a lot of wear to my cervical vertebrae and two anterior spondylolisthesis - one cervical, one lumbar, so I wonder if my spinal issues could be the cause. My neurologist was doubtful. He also couldn't explain the vibration sensation except to say that it can be caused by a  , which I certainly haven't had.  I just don't know where to go with this now.  My GP isn't interested and puts everything down to stress which I AM under it's true to say, but I don't think she's right. I've had to pay for all my neuro investigations as a result because she won't refer me or do any more blood tests etc.  I'm trying homeopathy, osteopathy and acupuncture as I want to find something that will relieve these weird symptoms and prefer to avoid drugs if I can. I'm 58, eat reasonably heathily, no alcohol, only 1 cup of coffee a day and my weight is normal. I broke my wrist badly at the end of August last year which is when my problems all seemed to start. i I also wonder if the metal plate that was used to fix the fracture could be causing some kind of strange reaction.

Autonomic Dysfunction,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/please-read-help--680446,PLEASE READ/HELP!!!,"Hi everyone! I am new to this website and this is my first post. It is going to be a long one, but I am hoping some people will take the time to read it and offer some advice. I'm a 19 year old female currently in my second year of college. For the past 6 months, I have been dealing with debilitating symptoms. I am going to start from the very beginning. Last week of my freshman year, (end of April 2018) I tested positive for Flu B. Ending my freshman year with the flu was the absolute worst timing. I was cramming for finals while also trying to be social. Being the dumbass I am, 3 days after my diagnosis, I decided to go out drinking one night thinking I would be fine. I also consumed no water and very little food before this. I was fine drinking before I went home. I went home and smoked a little weed. (Side note, I smoked weed every single day before all of this started happening.) I went to bed with what felt like heartburn that night but figured it was just because the flu, the weed, or something benign. I went to bed with the thought I was just tired and sick since it was 4 AM and that I would be fine in the morning. Boy was I wrong. The whole thing escalated. It felt like there was an elephant sitting on my chest, heart beating out of control, dizzy, couldn't see straight. I've never felt so god awful in my whole life. I had my roommate drive me to urgent care where they gave me a chest x-ray. They told me I was just dehydrated. (Made sense to me). Fast forward to 2 days later. It was the day I moved back home after the school year ended. I felt pretty much fine at this point compared to the other day. I had plans to hang out with all my friends that night. I smoked weed again thinking I'd be fine since a couple days had passed. I was wrong again. I immediately went to the bathroom and had severe diarrhea for 20 minutes and had the same symptoms I did the other day. I figured I was just dehydrated again but something in my gut was telling me something was wrong. I went to the ER that night where they just gave me an IV and some bloodwork which came back normal. The week after that was okay for the most part but then things started building up. I was dizzy all the time when standing, had horrible brain fog, palpitations, vision changes. I saw a total of 30 doctors over the summer to try and figure out what was wrong. Every single one of them told me it was anxiety. This made absolutely no sense to me because I had never once dealt with it in my life. Things got progressively worse as time went one. My GI tract was becoming affected. I also developed IBS and Gerd which I never dealt with before this all started happening. My sleep became severely impaired, I lost my appetite, and could barely leave the house. I work as a hostess during breaks where I stand for 6-7 hours without a break. I was always fine during this which was weird to me and doesn't make sense. I think I just pushed myself no matter how awful I felt since my job was the only thing I had going for me. I had many tests done including: - 3 CBC's - Lyme - CMV, EBV - Thyroid - Celiac - Several EKG's - Echo - Vitamin deficiency - Brain CT and MRI - Chest X-Rays - Eye exam - Hearing test - Pap Smear - Urinalysis all of these came back NORMAL. I even had a doctor tell me I was, ""picture perfect healthy!"" I felt completely defeated. As time went on my symptoms started adding up and got even worse. My symptoms included: - Dizziness - Vertigo - Sensitivity to loud noises and heat - God awful brain fog - Constipation - Nausea - Headaches - Palps - Chest pain - Extreme fatigue - Blurry vision - Pain sensitivity - Gerd and IBS - High heart rate upon sitting and standing I was eventually prescribed an SSRI and started seeing a therapist because every doctor was sick of seeing me me. Last week before school, I finally had a TTT done after persuading my PCP. Upon my results, it said, ""Meets criteria for pots."" I was so happy to finally have an answer. Except it wasn't that easy. My cardiologist, neurologist, and PCP all told me I definitely didn't have pots. But then why would the test say that? My cardiologist said I had some form of dysautonomia and that I needed to re-condition myself and that I would be back to normal. I have been at school for about a month now. My fatigue and brain fog is absolutely debilitating. I can sleep for 7 hours or I can sleep up to 12 and I will still so tired to even get out of bed. I used to go out and drink 4-5 nights a week and smoke every night and I haven't had a drink or smoked since April. I can't even go to the grocery store without feeling completely defeated. I'm also extremely sensitive to pain now. I stubbed my toe a few weeks ago and fainted! Absolutely terrifying. I have broken bones and gotten tattoos and have had no issues. Now the slightest amount of pain makes me feel like I'm gonna pass out. I have also developed migraines. I would get a headache maybe once a year. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated. I'm wondering if it could be CFS. My doctor's at home wouldn't test for an autoimmune disease because I showed no symptoms. I'm lucky if I leave my dorm most days. I don't think I ever needed an SSRI but now I am scared to stop taking it because I don't know how my body will react. (I take 25mg of Zoloft) I know I am supposed to be doing light exercise but I can't even get out of bed most days. Even showering becomes a huge struggle. My HR gets up to the 150's. I would be very grateful for any advice or ideas of what is going on with me. Thank you!   0 likes, 7 replies "

Autonomic Dysfunction,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/pots-with-high-and-low-blood-pressure--679966,POTS with High and Low Blood Pressure?," I was originally diagnosed with hyper adrenergic POTS, with a tilt table test in which my blood pressure sky rocketed along with my pulse. Now, recently, I have been in a ""flare up"" for 4 months in which my blood pressure drops and my pulse rises. 100/37 and 227 HR from standing still for 5 minutes. I can't seem to control my body temperature, varying from hot to freezing. They have checked my stomach (  and endoscopy due to digestive issues), multiple EKGs, MRI/MRA of my neck and brain-- the only things that have come to their attention would be that I am hyper mobile and have Chiari I. I'm scheduled to see a neurosurgeon next month, but my doctor doesn't know if that's even the cause of my fainting. I am so tired all the time. My body constantly hurts, which they believe is from the hyper mobility. The   is so much worse. Does anyone have any insight? Does Chiari seem like it could be the culprit? I have never read of a POTS patient with high and low readings, so I am startled, to say the least. 0 likes, 3 replies "

Globus Sensation,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/is-this-globus--618252,Is this Globus...?,"Hi There, I have been having throat issues for the last 8 months which my GP led me to believe was acid reflux. Have since tried loads of remedies none really helping. Last week had an upper endoscopy examining esophagus and stomach and it was absolutely clear... the doctor suggested it might be globus but didn't give me any answers on how to fix it.... So here are the some of the issues I have 1. Tight feeling in throat that comes randomly. 2. Not at all related to eating (doesn't happen after eating) if anything eating/drinking soothes it. 3. Gets worse as the day goes on (never a problem first thing) peaks around 6-7pm. 4. When I get it nothing relieves it. It's not painful just annoying. Always better in the morning.  5. Can be fine for days at a time. 6. Often makes me want to swallow more frequently than normal.  7. When at worst feels like holding back from crying.  When I look into my throat in the mirror, if I can get my tongue low enough I am sure I can see some white/greyish patches down my throat towards the left (where it sometimes feels dry and makes me want to swallow) but I guess the endoscopy should have picked up if this was a problem? Or one of the two gp's that looked into my throat before that.  The only thing I have wondered that could be related is sometimes if I drink a lot of alcohol at the weekend I tend to get this feeling more on a Monday or Tuesday - so 24-48 hours AFTER having any alcohol, which makes me wonder if it can still be related? I never get it when drinking alcohol or shortly after.  I can be a worrier but I don't really have anxiety. I have a stress free job and a relaxed lifestyle so I don't see why this would be stress related.  Anyone have similar issues? Thanks,  Dani    0 likes, 14 replies "

First, it started as a discomfort/mild pain when yawning, burping or with hiccups. Then I was getting the same discomfort when swallowing saliva, not so much with food. I went to the ENT twice, who told me not to worry and said he is called convinced it is Eagle’s syndrome. Then I had to go to a dentist because of some frequent gum ulcers, and I mentioned this pain. He told me I have no ulcers behind my left tonsil, where the pain seems to be felt, but he seemed concerned and told me to ask another ENT to scope me (nasal scope) and so I did. The scope came out normal and Doc told me my throat is dry. So he prescribed a throat gargle, artificial saliva gel and steroid nasal spray. Nothing ... symptoms still the same. Then second week of August I was eating a chicken wrap (soft) and hit the spot which bothers me and spent three days in pain to the extent I could not swallow water without pain. I was concerned and went to a private clinic where they ordered some blood tests which came out normal except for one which says I might have a borderline autoimmune disease (to repeat that test). He also performed a CAT scan. All clear. Cannot understand what is happening. I don’t have a lump feeling some people describe with globus, but I have a pinch like/ knife like pain on left side of upper throat when I swallow saliva or yawn, etc. When I asked if acid reflux is possible. both said they don’t think it is the case since my throat does not seem red or irritated, not even the vocal chords. Sry for the lengthy explanation. I felt all details were relevant. I am so concerned and depressed with not knowing what is causing this pain, which I can lately sometimes also feel when I eat.

Globus Sensation,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-story-and-how-i-beat-globus-sensation-401346,My story and how I beat globus sensation,"I made a promise that if I got better I would share my story on this discussion board in the hope that I may help someone. All the posts on here were a great comfort to me when I was experiencing this awful condition. It all happened about 8 weeks ago. I was in the theatre and just sat down to begin the show when I ate a sweet normally, took a sip of water normally and afterwards felt like I was having difficulty swallowing. My mouth went super dry and I felt like a had a lump in my throat and my tongue was enlarged (it wasn't). I thought perhaps I was having a reaction to something so before the interval I had to leave and get out of there. I felt complete terror and danger and thought I was going to die. My husband was worried and took me to A&E. I couldnt breathe properly but was not wheezing. I felt like someone was strangling me, standing on my neck and I was in a complete panic that came out of nowhere. Apparently I had a panic attack or severe anxiety episode. Well, I didnt believe this diagnosis because I had over the years suffered from anxiety on and off and bouts of low mood but even when I have faced the most difficult times in my life, never have I had a panic attack so wondered why on such a happy day I would develop this. Anyway the initial attack was only the start of my problems, I was told the symptoms of my choking sensation would go away within a few hours. It didnt. This made it worse and I was not so easily going to put this down to stress as most things seem to be these days. I went to my GP who said I did seem to have some swelling in my neck and ordered me an ultrasound. As I couldn't wait 3 weeks for the paperwork to come through I saw an ENT consultant privately who put a camera up my nose and down my throat and said everyhing looked perfect and likely to be globus sensation which is common when experiencing panic attacks and anxiety. This only gave me some comfort because I was still feeling these awful symptoms. After the 4th week I had scan and this showed nothing. My thyroid was perfect, which I suspected may be the issue due to my high thyroid antibodies, although I knew I had normal thyroid function. This was also some comfort. I was suffering, and it was really really getting me down. Having to get up every day and go to work was so hard and I was so anxious I was not sleeping or eating well. I thought I would have it forever. After a while I started to think, well this isn't going to kill me as time has proven, its not getting worse or better so I need to start trying things to see if anything helps. I also had a strange crawling sensation in my neck not on top of my skin but underneath - hard to explain. Also when I put chin to chest I felt like the part between my neck and chin was swollen. I tried breathing exercises, hot water bottles, hot baths, drinking red wine, taking NSAI's, drinking loads of water, trying to eat better, sleep better, watching funny films but nothing worked. I then found a couple of websites online suggesting a very simple neck exercise to do many times throughout the day and specifically for globus sufferers. I started to do this and over a week the symptoms started to ease and has got better and better to the point that its only 5% there. The most important part is to make sure your shoulders are always down and pushed back as far as you can. No hunched shoulders or it won't work. Then carefully, with mouth closed, ease your neck back as far as it can go, all the time looking up to the ceiling. You should be able to feel yourself stretching your neck. It may make you cough a little. Then roll your head a little to left and right and centre. It probably won't work the first go. you have to do it many times a day over a week or so.  My GP said that panic attacks can cause a lot of problems in the neck, real tension and muscles, and other structures and a horrid sensation of a lump in your neck. I have to understand now that this is the cause. Apologies for the long post but it's a long story. I hope it helps someone.

I have been smoking for the past few years tho, but stopped since I started experience these weird feelings. About a week ago, after a big meal I started feeling like I had something in my throat. I got really panicked and tried coughing it, my friends tried calming me but nothing worked. I went to bed that night really afraid that I might have something bad, because it also made it hard for me to breath.  After that experience, every time I ate something I got the same feeling of a lump in my throat. It got really hard for me to swallow, I feel like the food isn't going down my throat and it scares me that I might choke, so for a few days I only drank liquids. Then, because I was not eating, I started having a burning sensation starting from the middle of my chest up to my mouth that I believe to be acid reflux because I sometimes do experience heartburn due to it.  I went to the doctor and she told me my throat is a bit red and that I have some mucus built up there, but that she cannot tell me anything more due to my lack of symptoms. I tried treating it with teas, gargles, humidifiers and even mucinex, I feel like the mucus started getting better but I still have the globus sensation after eating. The worst thing is that it makes me really afraid that I might have something really bad, everybody here knows that this sensation could be the symptom of some worse things.. Also I currently moved away for University and am an Ocean away from my family, which does not make it better. But in 3 weeks I finish my semester and am going back for summer so I am looking forward to that. Please, if anybody has some tips to make this better, I will appreciate anything.

I'm scared cause i don't know what it really is i just need answers on it so i can stop panicing about it cause everytime i panic about it i get anxeity attacks and it's really not healty for the body to be in panic all the time. I also was losing sleep cause of it but not that much no more i have gotten a good sleep last night which is a good sign. If anyone can talk me through this it would be great cause i'm young and i get scared quickly when my body doesn't feel right, i just don't want this to affect me no more cause i have been missing alot of school cause of it and it's starting to worry me more and more everyday.

I have pretty much lost the will to live at this point. My illness (UNDIAGNOSED DESPITE YEARS OF DOCTORS VISITS - aka, they're all uncertain.) makes me an absolute disgusting mess. history: I have heartburn and a history of sinus infections, previously had inflammation of my esophagus from my illness. age: 23 sex:male height: 5'7"" weight: 245 lbs race: white duration: 5 years location geographic: Northeast US on body: throat Meds: omeprozole 40mg , adderall 20 mg For the last five years of my life I've had trouble eating without food getting stuck in my throat. If food doesn't get stuck, consumption of liquids gives me awful phlegm which I must dispose of subtly through-out my day. It isn't food itself that gets stuck in my throat, rather it gets stuck in sticky saliva that coats my throat and creates a situation like a clogged drain. When I drink water to fix the issue, my throat gurgles and the water passes narrowly through the obstruction. Nothing helps but to puke. I get the feeling at the very bottom of my throat just above my chest and never in my chest. If I try to hold it down, drink water, take a tums and relax - I merely wind up burping the water and my obstruction out eventually. I drink 8-9 drinks of water through out every day Why does food do this? I can't live a normal life and at this rate if I'm going to spend my entire youth so sick I'd rather die. My doctors haven't been able to get to the bottom of it. I don't think I can stress enough how life altering this is. I have some good days but for the most part, I can't eat or drink without having to spit. My saliva is so sticky that it literally can dangle upside down without falling WITH food inside of it like spiderman's web or something. It's disgusting and I feel like an animal. ' I've had scopes and the barium test that have yielded no results. I swear my body was playing tricks on me the way I didn't get an obstruction during and the scope found my throat to be irritated but not narrow. Please somebody give me some suggestions.

Off to the doctors i went and was diagnosed with Globus, the feelings of there being something causing discomfort when swallowing got worse, I also had night sweats, pains in lower left of jaw and more recently a clicking in throat when swallowing.. Over the past 18 months I have been sent for a chest/throat xray, had 6 nasal endoscopies (the last two without anaesthetic as it made my throat sore for 2 weeks after and numbed it so much at the time I actually couldnt swallow at all), I was also sent for a Gastroscopy (camera all the way down my windpipe whilst awake to assess my esophageus) , I have had at least 6 bloodtests to check for lymphocites, thyroid , liver, kidney issues white and red cell counts and anything else abnormal in the blood All of which came back clear. I also got a coating at the back of my toungue that has been treated several times but still returns.. I have had lots of different doctors/ consultants feeling my lymph glands.. All results fine The feeling of globus is as you know very worrying and often frightening, for me it caused major health anxiety as I had just followed the step by step daily blog of a close friend who ended up dying of oesophageal cancer, so that worry has always lived in the back of my mind. I am on Citalopram and Diazepam when the feeling gets bad and the doctor is now trying out Lorazepam in case GERD is causing my globus. I also started hitting half a bottle of strong wine a night to ease my worried mind as the only time i got any peace from my worries was when i was asleep.. I believe that it is most definately made worse by the vicious cycle of worry that it perpetuates .. My tips for surviving GH are.. 1. Cut out as much worrying as you can 2. Accept the feeling GH brings dont fight it 3. Relax as much as you can 4. Get plenty of sleep as my GH seems to get worse later in the day and a lie in helps 5. I Dont gargle with chemicals / mouthwashes as it makes my throat feel worse the next day. 6. This works for me try it if you like at your own risk..When GH strikes try stretching your neck by tilting your head back and stretching your lips forward as though you were trying to kiss the roof whist at the same time lightly massage your neck muscles around the tightness affected area i do this for around five minutes. 7. I use a distraction technique by diverting my thoughts to listening to some music or doing something i enjoy.. 8. I have had 9 months of CBT which helped me to manage and understand my worries ( ask your doctor for Cognative Behavioural Therapy to help manage your GH worries and anything that may be underlying causing your other worries) 9. Always see your doctor and get checked out if you have any unusual symptoms in your throat, neck, mouth or oeasopageus or any issues with swallowing. I believe that as there is no known cure as such the best and only plan of action is to manage the symptoms when they come on and as you get used to managing them you should worry less because you will be in control.. I wish each and every one of my fellow GH sufferers my sincere best wishes and good luch on getting to grips with this mentally destructive illness..

I been to the emergency room 6 times for it (they didn't do much except refer me to a gastroenterologist. The G.I. doctor did a upper endoscopy, and found nothing, he then referred me to a ENT doctor.  The ENT doctor said it was a muscle spasm, stop thinking about it and it will go away. Well, 3 months later and its still here. I just went back to the ENT and he finally used the term  . He scheduled me for esophageal manometry.  He said depending on the results I may be able to get treatment for it. The doctor said the specialist can use botox or ""cut"" the muscle to treat this. I am scheduled in 2 weeks to get the Esophageal manometry and see the specialist.   Before this happened to me I never heard of such a condition.  I read online it's caused by: 1. stress 2. post nasal drip or something to do with the mucosa in the throat 3. Trauma to the throat or swallowing something huge (What I believe caused mine) 4. Gerd (Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease) Most forums, and blogs all say similar things....stop thinking about it, try a antihistamine or purple pill. There are also exercises for it. But out of all these treatments most people still seem to suffer from this.  I would imagine if it was   induced it would be logical to assume it will go away if one stops thinking about it. If it's caused by post nasal drip, it seems reasonable the antihistamine would work, and obviously if it's caused by GERD it would be reasonable to believe the purple pill (Prylosec, or Zantac...ect) will help. But what about trauma? I seen one person posted on the forums there is a place in NY and  in NC that treat it with Botox. After seeing that post is when i really started to get hope, and now the ENT confirming this makes me feel even better. I live in Philadelphia i was worried what if i have to go to NY or NC to treat it, but they treat it right here in the city. I been looking online to try to find out if anyone had been treated for this with Botox or surgery, but I haven't found any results yet. So i will keep posting my experience with this. I hope one of these treatments can be performed and if so i will post the results here.    To be continued...I will post after March 20th when i get the manometry and speak to the specialist. 3 likes, 31 replies "

I had the tubes put in in June, and it was a very rough recovery for my right ear (my bad ear), and I could not get the ""open"" and ""echo-ey"" feeling out of my ear for a week. Finally, it healed, but then the problem came back in July. I don't really know how to describe it other than my voice was echoing in my head, and I could no longer ""block"" my ears due to the PE tube, but it felt like my right ear was ""open."" I was prescribed ear drops which felt like I had finally gotten the relief I needed, until about a month ago. I returned to my job at a restaurant and   I was at work my right ear would ""open"" and it would all be so echo-ey and I could hardly hear a thing out of it. (Also my blinking and yawning became audible in my right ear.) I went to my Dr. but he said it was brought on likely by the loud noises at work and that there was nothing they could do.  my right ear is constantly ""opening"" and I can hearing my blinks and yawns, and hearing out of it is becoming so frustrating. I am 21 years old and I just sometimes feel like my life has been taken over by my ETD and there will never be a real fix. I guess I am just looking to see if anyone has had trouble with their PE tubes after getting them??? I am not sure how to ""relieve"" this issue because I can't ""block"" my ears anymore by sniffing while holding my nose with the tubes in. I am just feeling really helpless.

I was ""diagnosed"" with ETD by a GP, however I have not been able to see a new ENT to get a proper diagnosis. I live in Australia and the whole process of getting a referral and the wait time to see a specialist is at least a few months, at least where I live. The swelling is in my left cheek, and it's hard and tight to the touch. It's extremely painful and there's a very disturbing pressure feeling behind it. The severity of the pain changes along with the size of the swelling and the hardness, sometimes it's just annoying and other times it's unbearable. The patch of pain/pressure is on the left side of the forehead, just above my ear and in line with my eyes, and the size is a bit smaller than my palm. It also changes in terms of severity, but yesterday it was so painful for over two hours, all I could do was cry and scream, two things which made me feel even worse. I took Panadeine Forte, the strongest prescription painkiller that doctors will (reluctantly) prescribe here, and that didn't do anything at all, the pain actually got worse after I took it. My eyes have been very painful for a while. They look red, on the eyelid and underneath, and it looks a bit like there's a small bruise on both outer corners. It hurts to keep my eyes open, and there are times when I can't even open them, it stings so much. On the inner corner of my left eye, there is an odd hardness that is not present in my right eye, and the more hard and swollen my cheek is, the harder that inner corner is. There are also occasional weird puffs of air coming from the bottom of my left eye. I currently have a sinus infection and am bleeding out the left nostril. I have been doing sinus rinses and small black spots keep coming out. I also might have an ear infection right now, it certainly feels like it - I haven't had my ears checked recently but I  do have ear infections most of the time. The left side of my face feels numb, and it tingles sometimes. I am worried I'm going to end up with facial paralysis. The pain in my cheek and the patch on my forehead started to get worse on Saturday, and it's been worse every day since. It feels like there's a strange combination of both burning and an icy sting in those two areas. I don't known what to do any more... I have tried the following: Nothing helps... I don't know what to do any more. l am so distressed by this. I don't know why this is even happening, if it even really is ETD or something else, or if I'm just losing my mind. If there are any suggestions (besides going to hospital, I have already been and told the ER is for car crashes, heart attacks and the like, even after I fainted I was just given an arm X-ray and sent home.). I haven't seen many examples of this kind of cheek/forehead patch pain in ETD groups, which makes me really think maybe this isn't ETD at all, it's just yet another misdiagnosis.

Eustachian Tube Dysfunction,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/eustachian-tube-dysfunction-cure-336452,Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Cure,"    As far as I know, there is not ETD cure, yet. I am interested in finding one. I am a Caucasian 34 year old man living in Santa Clara, CA. I have a BA in Psychology and work in a Neuroscience Lab. I was diagnosed with ETD a year ago. I have been suffering from it for 17 years. 13 years ago I had a bought of Bulimia that lasted for about a year. I had Anorexia Nervosa as an adolescent. I was given the maximum dose of testosterone to boost me through puberty since Anorexia was preventing it. Soon after I abused alcohol, marijuana, tobacco, and various other drugs until 2005. I believe all these factors have contributed to my ETD. I was diagnosed with OCD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder two years ago and have been taking Effexor (Venlafaxine) to cope. An Ear, Nose, Throat  doctor (currently called Head and Neck surgeon in US) prescribed me Flunisolide (coritcosteroid) to reduce ETD inflammation. It seems to help a little, but it is certainly not a cure, even when used for a significant period of time (i.e. 3 weeks).     My ETD has been recently aggravated by my attempts to remove pimples and skin tags, which may be a symptom of OCD. Has anyone else experienced this situation? Numerous doctors say there is no connection between the skin abrasions and ETD, but they obviously don't have ETD.     Primarily, I am asking for information regarding ETD. I need to know the statistics of ETD so that I can develop a valid research proposal. Health organizations neglect to respond to my questions. It seems that most biological research is involved in diseases such as cancer and heart disease, which is great. But, as I am sure that anyone reading this knows, Eustachian Tube Dysfunction is a debilitating disease that hinders one's ability to live to their fullest potential. As I have recently graduated with a Bachelors degree. I am researching what my next step will be. I am strongly leaning towards statistics and data mining, since that is a much needed position in all research fields.     I am looking for information on the number of people with ETD worldwide and specific to certain regions. A timeline of ETD cases in these regions. Research groups, Academic and Professional, that are researching ETD. Research groups that are investigating ETD from the Neuroscience and/or Ear, Nose, Throat (Head and Neck surgery) perspective. Any other information is helpful as well, especially your own personal accounts of ETD. Please share your history, as much as you care to disclose, so that I can begin to develop an etiology of ETD.     I have read many of the other discussions on ETD and recognize that many of you are suffering and I certainly empathize with you all. I am still trying to decide if my anxiety disorders are the result of ETD, my ETD the result of my anxiety disorders, if they are mutually intertwined, and/or if something else is going on. I very much hope to hear from you so that we may begin to develop a cure for ETD so that we may not be hindered by this ruthless malfunction.     1 like, 209 replies "

I am looking for someone who has had PE (pressure equalizer) tubes put in their ears to ""cure"" their ETD. I had them placed in June, and still have not found that I am healed. My right ear, which is my bad ear, is still in pain and often times ""opens"" as it did before the tube was put in, but now with the tube I cannot block my ear to ""fix"" it. My ear hurts when I yawn, as if there is something trying to be pushed out of it, and maybe if I yawn   hard enough it will. I am   having hearing problems with my right ear occasionally due to this. I went to my ENT (who does not take me seriously as a 21 year old girl) and he said that this was happening because of loud environments and there is nothing he can do to help me. Sometimes ear drops take away the ""open"" effect, but other times they do absolutely nothing. (Not to mention I am pretty weary of ear drops now, after being prescribed some this summer to ""fix"" this issue, and instead I had a very scary allergic reaction.) I just feel like there is no winning and I will never, ever live a normal life again. Has ANYONE as an adult had these tubes put it to relieve their symptoms???? Did something similar happen to you??? I really just need someone who understands what is happening inside my head...because no one really gets it 😦 0 likes, 1 reply "

What i would  like to know is.....will the hearing come back gradually, a little at a time with all the effort of the various exercises i'm doing or will it just 'pop' back to normal in a flash as it usually  does when one gets off an airplane....i keep expecting a great big pop and to instantly feel better but i suspect it doesn't work that way....would love to know others experiences as i'm feeling very disheartened by the whole thing. thank you in advance 0 likes, 1 reply "

So try stay poisitve and remember you aren’t the only one going through this, it is a horrible condition but we could be off much worse (actually having 100% hearing loss).  I’m not one to talk as I too have my reallly pessimistic days such as earlier today when I was trying to study for my exams and I just couldnt focus but at the end of the day I do believe our bodies know that there is something off and they will heal with time even though it might take quite a while. Another important point I wanted to list is: Please don’t compare your life right now to how it was prior to this condition as it will just make the situation a million times worse for you, consider this as a challenge which you will conquer at the end of the day. I am quite sure this is not permanent it does not make sense for it to be and although it might take time for it to heal it definitely will (depending on its cause of course) slight update to I have started taking tea with ginger turmeric honey and lemon, I’m not one to usually believe in this natural remedy stuff as my mind is quite scientific but I thought i might give it a shot as alt of people I know swear by it.   0 likes, 12 replies "

Back to now, I have had a slight blocked nose feeling in my affected ear for years, so suspecting I have a chronic thing going on, I have had a permanent runny nose for what seems years, never without a tissue. A few weeks ago I suspected that my EDT was coming back, bit different symptoms this time, my ear is blocked, at first it only blocked whilst laid on that ear and cleared as soon as I moved, but now it is blocked and full feeling all the time with muffled hearing, I can hear my own voice a bit in my head, a hollow sound on the bones around my ear, when holding my nostrils and breathing out, I can pop the ear after a few times, but the blocked feeling comes back instantly, pulling and prodding the outside of my ear also gives momentary relief. I is driving me mad but also getting used to it. Just hoping it sorts itself out but I'm probably prone to it, I always get pains in my face when I have a cold or headache. For some reason it is far worse with noise, noises are heightened, but at least this time I haven't got thd distorted sounds, anyone else have similar symptoms? 0 likes, 11 replies "

Its like my head is heavy.Its almost constantly there, and i can always feel it in the background, its like a mild wooziness in the frontal part of my head. around the same time i also developed ear blockage that wouldnt seem to go away, ive tried countless medications for that.  Ive always had spring   so i thought it had come early that year, and visited my ENT who started me on corticosteroid sprays and a mucolytic, but the problem just persisted and wouldnt go away. ear pressure(mainly in left ear) +   + a sensitiviy to loud sounds + imbalance when walking(feels strange) although i must mention i never fell down or anything. I would wake up in the morning and sounds would feel just annoying in my ear( doors closing/ knives+forks dropping on plates .. etc).  Fast forward to this day, and i have visited over 6 different ENT specialists and 1 Neurology specialist. I had done a CT, MRI, an EEG and some bloodwork. All came back normal. I have tried countless medications, from   to corticosteroid sprays to Betacerc and finally anti   medication. Ive been on anti anxiety medication for 2 weeks now, still cant tell if my symptoms are getting better ..  To  1 year of dizziness, ear pressure , sensitivity to sound , and feeling of dysequilibrium. final diagnosis is Anxiety.  Could it be ETD ? i have no negative pressure value in my ear upo examination( normal tympanometry result) and no retracted tympanic membare on otoscopy. Does that rule out ETD ? or could the Eustachian tube be blocked without having signs on examination ?  This past year was not easy, this has had a huge impact on my life and its my first time posting here. .

I have been switched a lot in the last 2 years and been off work due to a burn out and anxiety. I was on zoloft from july to end of september but wasnt doing good on it. So my psychiatrist decided to try for first time in last decade to stopped meds and see how I would do.....bad idea! I had a severe withdrawing from just going from 25mg to zero and in 5 weeks I just spiraled into panic attacks and bad depression which left me to go to hospital for 2 weeks. Because I had succes in the past with lexapro, they put me back on it. Also with the clonazepam I take since 2 years at about 0.5 mg per day max.I was started at 10mg lexapro for 5 weeks and now Im at 12,5mg. I will have to go to 15mg. It kinda help a bit from the start, meaning no more panics and a little more calm. By week 4 or 5, I felt better and had 3  days where I felt more energic but it wasnt an all day long energy. now I am on 12,5 since a week and feel soo tired again. My anxiety and depression is definitly way better than it was even if sometimes, I feel a little anxious inside around evening. My psychiatrist told me it can take effect around 4 to 6 weeks but for some it can go to 12 weeks...Depending on the issue or metabolism. My question is,... is it normal to have a start in energy around week 4-5 then this go away after I upped a bit. The fatigue /tiredness is for me a side effect I wish that will lower a bit so I can be more active and motivate. Maybe I am still recuparating from my last 2 years of beeing switched meds continualy or also from the bad spiraling I went through in october???

I'm not sure if this could be related but shortly before this all started I went swimming and got water stuck in my ear for about 5 days which did cause a little bit of pain but then completely disappeared. I've had no pain in my ears since then just this weird head feeling. It's driving me mad because I don't know what to suggest anymore. Should I keep pushing to get referred to a specialist? 0 likes, 3 replies "
Escitalopram,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/lexapro-5mg-for-anxiety-and-depression-698104,Lexapro 5mg for anxiety and depression ,"I am pregnant and getting ready to have a baby in a few short weeks. I have always suffered with   and  . Before getting pregnant, I was on lexapro 20mg. When I got pregnant I stopped taking the medication because I didnt want my baby consuming the medication as well. I did really well up until the past two weeks. I havent had any complications with my pregnancy, but there has been a lot of stress the past few months. I have also suffered from harm ocd in the past. I was on zoloft at the time and seen a therapist and ended up getting past it. I noticed a few weeks ago my ocd was starting again. I know I would never act on those thoughts, and I dont want to. But they do cause so much distress. So I talked to my OB and decided to go ahead and start some medication, since I'm having so much anxiety and already experiencing depression. He started me on Zoloft 25mg. I took it for a week and I just couldn't stand how I felt. I know it gets worse before better, but it just made my negative thoughts 100x worse. And I probably should have waited it out but I didn't. So I switched to lexapro 5mg. My last dose of zoloft was on Tuesday, and Wednesday was my first dose of lexapro. I feel so much more horrible than I did even before starting medication. My mind just wont stop racing. Horrible images always in my head, and it just keeps getting worse and worse. I cant focus or concentrate.  And its just making me so depressed. I just want to feel good again and not have such negative thoughts. I feel like im never going to get there, and my mind will never be mine again. I just need some encouragement. I know I have to give the medication time, because I'm not giving them enough time to work. Its just so hard to keep taking something that makes you feel awful. I need to be on something so my baby has a healthy mommy. But at this point Im just ready to give up. This is suppose to be the happiest time of my life, and because of what im going through mentally, its definitely not. I have a huge support system. And i am very open with my SO and my family about what im going through. And they have all been amazing. I just need someone to tell me that they did finally get relief from lexapro. And that these thoughts and images, and depression all will eventually fade. I've been through this before, but it just wasnt this horrible. And I'm sure with my crazy pregnancy hormones, and anxiety and post partum depression, and switching of medications has really just done a number on me. And the mood swings do not help! I'm also not sure if the zoloft can still be in my system as well and messing with me, and then trying to just adjust to the lexapro too has anything to do with it. Im sorry for the long rant, I just feel so hopeless and discouraged 😦 0 likes, 5 replies "

I took it for 7 days and I couldnt do it anymore. It made me very sick. The first few days I couldnt eat at all. And I became extremely paranoid, my mind was racing to the point I was insane. I felt numb and had no emotion at all. Then I was having suicidal thoughts, and I HAVE NEVER had suicidal thoughts and almost went to psych at the hospital, because I couldnt take how I felt any longer. It felt like my mind was talking out loud, and my family has been having people sit and babysit me for the past 4 days because of it. So they switched me to lexapro 5mg, Tuesday is the last time I took the zoloft. Yesterday I took the lexapro for the first time. Yesterday was absolutely horrible. Im not sure if it was from going off the zoloft or what. But I am so nervous to take the lexapro again. I need to be on something though.

Eustachian Tube Dysfunction,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/recently-dx-w-etd-looking-into-pots-and-lupus-but-unsure-v-distressed-getting-worse-quickly-682041,"Recently dx w/ ETD, looking into POTS and lupus, but unsure... v. distressed, getting worse quickly","I've been dealing with a lot of very distressing symptoms for almost three years now. Mainly, and most severely, a strange and unbearable head pressure (next to my eyes, above the ears, painful to touch) and a disgusting and uncomfortable feeling of my nose, ears, brain and tongue being sucked very harshly back down into my throat. And an intense dizziness that feels like I'm in a small boat during a thunderstorm, or like I'm forever falling down a bottomless pit. I have a lot of pain in my nose (an icy sort of sting), particularly on the left side, which the nostril is slightly smaller than the left, and every day it swells up just to the side and underneath my eye, for at least a few hours. However, I have been diagnosed with a deviated septum, with the bend being in the less painful right side. Recently, a few weeks ago probably less, I was diagnosed with Eustachian Tube Dysfunction, and a sinus infection with bleeding on my right side. Again, this is the LESS painful side. I just don't know if this is the right answer, and I don't know what to do about it. I don't know if my doctor was right, he just looked up my nose with a flashlight and a magnifier and saw the infection and bleeding and came to that conclusion. The antibiotics and cream he gave me haven't helped at all. Nor do any ETD home remedies or things like chewing gum or yawning. I feel worse today than I did before the diagnosis. I don't know what to do, I have offered all sorts of solutions to ETD but doctors say they won't do it, and I have been told that probably isn't even the right diagnosis. I don't know any more, the day I got diagnosed I felt so relieved, now I'm just lost again. I also have redness in my throat, and it hurts like icy dryness to breathe through my mouth, which makes for a very distressing situation when my nose blocks up and I can't breathe through it. The back of my throat also closes up and my tongue feels painfully suctioned to the roof of my mouth at the back. Also, sometimes it hurts to touch my throat and under my chin, but I have been told my glands are okay, just a bit ""palpable"". I have had nosebleeds several times a day for over a month, it started out only occasionally, then once a week, then almost daily. I also spit up blood, but I have had my lungs checked and the conclusion the doctor gave was that the blood is most likely coming DOWN into my mouth, rather than up. I began to lose my hearing a few years ago, which came with tinnitus. Both have gotten progressively worse. It started out with worse hearing in the right ear and worse tinnitus in my left, but now it's pretty much equally bad on both sides, I can only notice slightly louder tinnitus in my left ear. My ears hurt and feel plugged up, as well as an icy pain similar to the nose pain. My eyesight is also getting progressively much worse, as of recently my glasses make an almost unnoticeable difference, I have to check several times to see there is a tiny difference. My last eye check was about two years ago, but surely it's not normal for them to be THIS bad... My eyes are also very painful and watery, and I see white lines and spots, with occasional white ""thunder"" that lasts a second. Sometimes I cannot even keep them open for more than a second because they feel like they're burning! Oh, also I recently found out that I got diagnosed with ""vertical micro saccades"" over a year ago, but I can't figure out what that means, if anything. Most likely not, because my doctor was so unconcerned he didn't even tell me, I read it from an old recommendation letter that I had lost. It is agonising to breathe, and has been getting worse for over two months, and quickly even worse over the past week. It feels like my lungs have shriveled up and filled up with ice. However, my lung x-rays and scans have come back clear. I wheeze a lot, especially recently, except 90% of the time when doctors are listening to my lungs, which is just my luck!!! They make me feel like an absolute fool and even accuse me of making it up but I'm not the only one who hears it at home. I also have a harsh, painful, ""barking"" cough. I get tachycardia, which is almost always accompanied by difficulty breathing through my nose due to blockage. It goes up to 200bpm, and it gets worse if I sit up or stand up. I also have slightly high or slightly low blood pressure, mostly low, especially when standing. I just recently had a scan, the doctor said I was experiencing ""sinus tachycardia"" at the time. I have tried to look that up but I have difficulty processing these days and I still don't understand what it means, but it looks like it's not a sinus issue despite it's name... I don't know, I can't understand anything any more, I used to be intelligent but now I can't think. I experience a very uncomfortable and distressing feeling of my heart ""fluttering"" and like it's flipping over but have been told the only problem with my heart is that it's beating hard and fast and they can't figure out why. I am currently seeing a new cardiologist who believes what I have is most likely Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome... but I can't help but get the feeling my head, heart and lung problems might not be separate illnesses. I don't think it's that simple. I do occasionally pass out or have ""drop attacks"" (without passing out), if I stand up, but rarely immediately - somebody told me that with POTS, the passing out is pretty much immediate, but for me it can take a minute or more. Sometimes I will get up to go to the bathroom and pass out halfway back to my bed. I had a slight stutter as a child, but as recently it's come back, far worse than it was back then. I can barely get a sentence out half of the time, ""t t t t t t t t tal tal tal sp sp spea sp t tal tal talking li li li li li like this"" and I can tell people are getting frustrated with me, they keep trying to finish my sentences and that just throws me off even more and worsens my anxiety. I don't know why this is happening, I didn't even have anywhere near this much trouble as a child. I've been told it's likely an emotional thing due to the anxiety from being so sick, but I worry that something is wrong with my brain. I used to be intelligent, now I can barely think most days, let alone study like I used to. I'm worried I'll just get less and less intelligent and more behind, and my stutter will get so bad I won't be able to say anything. Recent blood tests have shown that I have a low white blood cell count and low iron. The iron is very slowly coming back up with an iron powder drink, but I haven't had any improvement in the way I feel, the opposite in fact, I feel worse/weaker. The white blood cells are not coming back up, but they are apparently not accompanied by any results that hint at any sort of cancer or anything similarly bad. I was told it's most likely because my body has been fighting infections, which I get a lot particularly in the ear. My new neurologist thinks it sounds like I have lupus, but I disagree... I think it's gotta be more complicated than that. But my mum and nan are completely convinced this is what I have... they're far too optimistic that we've finally found the answer but I just don't think it's that simple. But they keep focusing on the symptoms I have that fit with lupus, while ignoring the things that don't. I am also having what feels like fevers, but only occasionally come up with fever temperatures when checked. But it feels like my body is burning, particularly my face, which is red under the eyes and on the cheeks, or red and burning all over my nose. I also get drenched with sweat, but still it rarely is a real fever. Currently I have a red patch on the right side of my head, which is very hot and pressured - this is the first day I have had a patch there, like that, and it is extremely painful. I do not know what to do. I am in agony with the pressure and dizziness. I read that cortisone injections can help, but I asked my doctor and he said he can't put an injection so close to my brain. I have an upcoming nerve test, cardiologist appointment, and neurologist appointment but everything is happening so slowly. Nobody seems to understand that I can't do this any more. I am to the point where I am self harming during anxiety attacks, and every morning when I wake up properly (after difficulty breathing all through the night, I keep waking up gasping for breath), I have an anxiety attack thinking of how much I don't want to go through another day of this. I don't want to be alive any more. I need to find a way out of this but I don't know what to ask for... I can't keep waiting for specialist appointments, I am getting worse too quickly and am extremely depressed, to the point that I have considered ending my life rather than starting the next year like this. I need a hint as to what I can do, at least just for the dizziness and the pressure. Nothing works... I've tried everything, from strong (codeine) painkillers, to marijuana (hurt my lungs too much and made dizziness and anxiety worse), I even tried getting drunk earlier this year, in a desperate attempt to try and see if SOMETHING would work. But obviously that was an extremely idiotic idea and I just ended up feeling sicker, and I felt so ashamed and foolish. I should add here, that I am from Australia, and am several hours from the city. Due to my orthostatic intolerance I cannot even handle a trip to the city, let alone a flight overseas, even if I could afford it... 0 likes, 3 replies "

Just some ideas that have seemed to help. I'm at the year mark. Have had issues with my right ear after a middle ear infection. Also, occasionally have a sensation like something is in my right nostril that needs to come out.  Seen 3 specialists, they don't seem to be concerned or have the time. One said I had a nasal polyp, the other disagreed. I posted back in April, thinking I was cured. I was wrong. You can read some of my previous notes, I don't follow the previous advise anymore. First, think back to before you had ETD. How often did you try to make you ears pop? Myself, I don't think my right ear ever functioned as well as my left, but it wasn't a focus until the infection, and my ear nearly ruptured. After that, it became a habit. My current strategy is to do as little adjusting as possible. Trying to pop my ear only makes things worse. I've found that if i gently apply pressure to my ear, with my middle finger on my tragus, I can hear air or fluid squish out. If i open my mouth all the way and do the same thing, it seems to set something back in place. I do this off and on but try to as little as possible. I do this before sleeping for the evening, so I have 8 hours to leave it alone. If you wake up in the morning feeling better, don't test anything just go about your day. Try to break the habit of focusing on the discomfort. Find things that keep you distracted. Meds- If you've been taking meds and they haven't helped, give them a rest for a couple weeks. If you're using anything like ear drops, or if you clean your ears all the time, stop. Let you ear wax naturalize. I get some relief from the new version of Flonase(oval white bottle, with light blue cap. I occasionaly take it right before bed. I have noticed though with my good ear, that if I use the spray for a long amount of time, it starts acting up. I've also seen results from 12 hour Claritin-D and standard Sudafed, the version that last 4-6 hours. Obviously, do not take them together, one or the other. Good luck. Eat healthy. Let me know if you experience the same issue of being able to press the air or fluid out of your ear... Again, gently try this at your own risk. Cartilage can break.

I want to apologize for the length of this post, but I feel it’s important for you to know my exact history and situation. After Eustachian Tube Balloon Dilation surgery, I have a constant crackle/popping/clicking/suction sound in my ears every time I swallow, yawn, chew, and drink. It’s not just here and there, it’s EVERY time I activate those muscles. I NEVER had this issue before. I was told the symptoms would go away with time, but they haven’t. It’s been over a year and my doctor has tried everything including steroid nasal sprays, tube placements twice in the past year, and a full-blown middle ear exploration surgery to find the source of the crackle. They all have failed. Valsalva maneuvers also don’t work. My doctor told me I might just be stuck with the symptoms. I am a 33 year old healthy male who is slightly overweight. I have scoured the internet over and over again and I cannot seem to find anyone with similar symptoms as me. I see one of the nation’s best doctors and he is struggling to find the answer to my problem. I am sharing my full story with everyone out in the world in hopes that out of the billions of people, there must be at least 1 person who has/had the same exact symptoms as me and found relief. I hope you take time to read my story, and I hope there is someone who reaches out that can help. Let me provide a quick rundown of my ear history. I was born 80% deaf in my right ear. Luckily, my other ear (left ear) has normal hearing, but I had drainage and pressure issues in both ears with lots of ear infections as a kid and I had tubes done 3 times. Since then, I have had constant problems with my right ear (80% deaf ear) that I will briefly describe now. I will reference my right ear as the “bad” ear and the following is all about this ear. In 2012, I had an infection that was spreading to my brain. I was sick with a fever for 3 weeks and hospitalized for several days because of the infection. After an ENT visited me in the hospital, he discovered that I had a cholesteatoma cyst growing inside my middle ear that was causing the infection. I was referred immediately to one of the best surgeons in the area, and we removed the cholesteatoma in surgery and my middle ear was completely gutted and cleaned. A year later after the ear fully healed, I had reconstructive surgery and had a prosthesis ear drum implanted. A year after that, signs that the infection from the cholesteatoma was coming back so we did another surgery to clean up the infection. There were complications from that 3rd surgery and I had a constant buzz in my ear from the prosthesis after wards, so we did a 4th surgery to swap out the old prosthesis for an upgraded titanium prosthesis. Before that 4th surgery I was constantly complaining to my doctor that my left ear (which is my normal ear) was causing me a lot of pain when I travel and fly for work. I had tubes put in that ear on many occasions in the office prior years following, with no resolution. My doctor recommended a new surgery that helps relieve Eustachian Tube Dysfunction, Eustachian Tube Balloon Dilation. He recommended we go ahead and do the tube dilation on both ears during my 4th surgery when he was working on swapping out the prosthesis in my bad ear. This was the worse decision of my life! After the 4 surgeries on my bad ear, I finally had that ear back to normal again, and then for the FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE, problems started in my good ear. Besides pains when flying, I never had an issue with my left ear before! It’s not pain, or discomfort, or complications with my hearing; it’s just a constant crackle/popping/clicking/suction in my left ear every time I swallow, yawn, chew, and drink. My bad ear does it too, but only at night when I am laying down. When I am in bed and my muscles are more relaxed, it is much louder and uncomfortable, and both ears do it. But during the day, it is EVERY time I swallow in my left ear. it’s not here or there, it’s EVERY time. My right ear does come and go during the day also, but my left ear is driving me mad. It’s so loud and noticeable that even over a year later, my brain has not been able to shut it off. I hear it in my sleep, I wake up constantly and pace the halls of my house trying to put my mind at ease, so I can go back to sleep. It’s effecting my work because I constantly have to walk away from my desk to forget about it. I am constantly shaking my head and yelling and trying to blow air through my ears hoping for relief. I have dreams of having dementia and mental disorders that I never had before. I have the thought of constantly wanting to stick something long through my ear. It’s all I think about and it truly is changing and damaging my way of life. My wife is really starting to worry about my well-being. And truthfully, so am I. This isn’t just a crackle, it’s like a suction crackle with a sequence of several clicks and pops. My doctor says that my ear is now doing what it’s supposed to and since I haven’t felt this my whole life, I’m just not used to it. I’m sorry but if this is normal, I don’t know how any of us can manage. I always think about how my ear was before the balloon dilation and all the years the crackle wasn’t there, and I wish so badly I could just go back to how that was. I wish I never did the surgery. I am constantly asking myself, will I be able to manage this for the rest of my life, and the thought of having to put up with this another 30+ years just drives me crazy. My doctor and I tried to fix the crackling since the balloon dilation surgery, but we’ve been unsuccessful. Immediately after the 4th surgery (aka = dilation surgery), I complained to my doctor that I had a constant popping sound in my left ear that I’ve never had before, and he told me it is common after this type of surgery and it should go away in time. The first few months were rough. I got ZERO relief and had trouble sleeping while my brain adjusted to this new sound and uncomfortable sensation. 3 months went by and there wasn’t a single time the crackle wasn’t there when I swallowed. I began to get very worried the crackle is permanent, and at my 3-month post-op checkup, I tell my doctor about it. He prescribed me nasal steroids to see if a fluid is trapped in my eustachian tube to help clean it up. I used them religiously for 3 months and even though I had some sort of relief (that or my brain was slightly adjusting) the crackle in my ear was still constant and I told him this at my 6-month checkup. He put a tube in my crackle ear in my office to see if relieving pressure would work, and it didn’t change a thing. At my 9-month checkup, you could tell my doctor was really starting to worry. He told me he had a meeting coming up in October 2018 with the 4 other surgeons in the USA who do the balloon dilation surgery, and he wanted to present my case to them to see if they have any suggestions. He personally called me after that meeting a month later and explained that they discussed my case and recommend we do a middle ear exploration surgery to see if the issue can be found. I was very skeptical about doing this because my left ear has never been touched before (except the eustachian tubes and tubes in my ear drum) and it was the only good ear I have so I didn’t want to open up a whole new can of worms and possibly damage hearing in that ear. After debating it for a couple months, my wife and I finally decided that since I wasn’t getting any relief from the crackles anyways, we might as well do the surgery. I prayed and prayed that when I woke up from the surgery the crackling would be gone. When I opened my eyes in recovery, I slowly closed them back down, took a deep breath, whispered to myself, “please, please, please,” and then took a deep swallow. The crackling… was still there. My heart sank and I was immediately in mental agony. The doctor came in and said he did find some scar bands and other tissue that could have been rubbing against my ear drum causing the sounds. Unfortunately, while I laid in recovery, it was still the same as before. When I was standing and walking again, and I left the hospital, I did notice some relief that I’ve never felt before! On the mercies of god, during that day the relief got better and better and the crackling was eventually gone! Like completely gone! For the first time since the balloon dilation surgery, the left ear had NO CRACKLING! It was the greatest feeling in the world! The relief, however, was short lived. During the next 4 days, the crackling would come back during random times, especially while laying down. Luckily, it would only last for a little bit and the crackling would go away. I thought, if it’s just for a short period of time each day, I can manage that! But every day, the crackling would come back longer and stronger. 5 days after the surgery, I seen my doctor to have all the packing from the surgery removed. Once the packing was removed, I could instantly hear better, but I noticed the crackling was there, but very faint. Well, since the packing was removed, the crackling has been constant again, just as before! That week was probably the hardest for me mentally. For 4 days I thought the problem was gone (my brain got a taste of what it is like again without constant crackles and pops in my ears) and the fact that the crackle was back and nothing I did got rid of it, really made it hard to cope with. I had several anxiety attacks and couldn’t sleep. I had to retrain my brain to shut this sound off. I performed several Valsalva maneuvers to help, and there were certain times I actually got relief in my left ear where the crackling would go away, but it would immediately come back. The Valsalva maneuver actually never helped with my left ear before, so the fact I was getting at least some temporary relief when I was performing it was a good sign. However, now a month after the surgery, Valsalva maneuver’s don’t work just like they didn’t before, and the crackling is almost identical as before, with one exception; there a couple swallows a day where the crackle isn’t there. I’m talking like maybe 5 in the whole day. Before it was 100% of the time, now it’s 99% of the time. A step in the right direction, but not nearly enough relief for it to be manageable. On another bad note, I am noticing weird feelings in my bad ear (the other ear that had 4 surgeries) that I never felt before, and now I have a very constant, but very faint, ringing in my good ear (but I’m hoping that goes away in time since I just had surgery a month ago). On a positive note, my left ear has no pain when riding the high-rise elevator to my work office everyday like it did before the last surgery, so that’s good at least. I mentioned to my doctor that I would like a 2nd opinion, but he is skeptical that I will find any doctors in the country who is as experienced and knowledgeable as he is. It’s a pompous thing for him to say, but it’s true. I told him my theory. I think my Eustachian tubes have been so used to being closed shut my whole life, that we disrupted them when we did the balloon dilation. The dilation opened them up, but only a little and now I have the crackles because my Eustachian tubes want to stay shut but for the first time in my life they are actually trying to open. I feel like another Eustachian tube dilation surgery would help because it would open them up even more and really get them to where they should be, but he is concerned that if we do that, we will open them up too much which causes other serious problems that he wants to avoid. His theory is over time my tubes will settle and the crackling will disappear or I may just be stuck with the symptoms consequently for opening up the eustachian tubes. I feel like there just has to be someone out there with the same symptoms as me, who possible has found relief or a solution. Thank you for taking your time to read this. 0 likes, 8 replies "
Eustachian Tube Dysfunction,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/eustachian-tube-696530,eustachian tube,"hi,  this is what an old ENT doctor told me 40 years ago and at the time he was nearing retirement. He stated that the Eustachian Tube and inner ear are not well vascularized so taking   by mouth are not going to be 100% effective as a systemic approach.  He gave me antibiotic ear drops with lidocaine..... I think it was called lidosporin which is probably not made anymore. 2 drops in each ear when I felt a cold coming on would effectively shut down that infection & I wouldn't get sick.  This as an off label situation.  I tried to get it refilled and nobody would write the perscription for me, saying  it wasn't used for what I was using it for.....its not going to pass through the ear drum.  But the doctor that gave it to me told me to demand it.   The antibiotic part of the formula they will say won't penetrate the ear drum......but to me ....it does.  He also said the situation had the eustachian closed and to open it up.....take an over the counter allergy pill.  it would open up the tube and the inner ear would drain.   He said the cause was blowing your nose.....the pressure pushes the infected mucose up into the inner ear.....causing the problem........and that doctors just don't understand that it can be treated systemically.....it has to be direct via the ear drops with antibiotic in them. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Eustachian Tube Dysfunction,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/patulous-eustachian-tube-vs-etd-696740,Patulous Eustachian Tube  vs. ETD,"Sorry for this long post but I am desperate. I can't seem to find any mention in this ETD section about anyone diagnosed with Patulous Eustachian Tube (PET). I do have seasonal allergies and have had sinus surgery twice. The 2nd surgery in 2011 solved my sinus issues. My ear fullness, muffled hearing, and head pressure started abrubtly  in Aug 2017. I have never previously had any ear or eustachian problems in my life. My ENT tried many things including  ,  , nasal steroid sprays, saline spray and rinses,  , diuretics, allergy shots,  , and an MRI on my head and neck to rule out the big bad stuff.  He finally gave up and told me he was convinced I had TMJ. Had TMJ surgery that was both ""diagnostic and therapeutic"" at Emory in Atlanta, GA IN Aug 2018. TMJ specialist was honest and said he thought he might have proactively fixed some potential problems i might have had  further on in life with my jaw but didnt feel that i had TMJ which was causing my ear issues.  He was right, no change in any of the ETD symptoms so i move on to another ENT.  More ear examinations and hearing tests showing low frequency hearing loss that was normal for my age. He suggests that putting in tubes may help and schedules procedure. morning of procedure while in his chair he decides its probably not going to help and refers me on to an Otologist instead. Finally get in to see her in Dec 2018 and more hearing tests. However she immediately notes that my medical record showed a substantial weight loss right before my ETD issues started. She looks in my ear and says that she can see my eardrums moving with each breath therefore my Eustachian Tubes are open or Patulous. She tells me to order the PATULEND drops from a Dr in CA and that it may take a couple of months but these drops would close my tubes.  I have religiously done these nasal drops since Dec to no avail.  I called the otologist back this week to report no change and she tells me to call a Dr Poe in Boston because he is a specialist in Patulous Eustachian Tube. I am completely frustrated and at a loss as to what to do for two reasons. 1 - I live in Atlanta and 2 - I cant seem to convince myself that i actually have PET. I do not and have never had any of the hallmark symptoms such as hearing my own voice or hearbeat.  I do internally  hear my the crunching or cracking of my neck or jaw loudly but I dont believe this is autophony.  Bottomline is I'm looking for anyone else out there with my similar situation who has been told they have PET. And if so, does anyone know a good Dr in the southeastern  USA who can help me? I cant travel to Boston and I just cant keep living like this day to day. 0 likes, 4 replies "

As some of you know, I had my surgery ( Balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube ) on Friday 7/7/2017.  I was under general anesthesia ( pleasant experience ) and the procedure took about 20 minutes. Some observations. Procedure was painless post op except for the soreness in my throat which usually occurs when you are intubated as I was. Chewed a lot of ice chips the past few days. Almost back to normal. As my doctor told me post op, I do have a feeling of fullness which should last a week or so as the swelling subsides. I am quite congested as a result of the anesthesia and the fact that my E tubes we stretched to capacity. Coughing up a lot of phlegm and sputum, ( sorry for the gross out )  which is expected and normal for this type of procedure. I still have little crackles and pops in my ear, again to be expected.  Physically I feel great otherwise. Slept a lot when I returned home Friday. Doctor Undavia was pleased with the outcome and expects this will solve my problem long term. ?Will see him in 2 weeks for follow up. A word about the facility. All of the staff at DelCo Memorial Hospital were  warm and accomodating.

November 2015 i felt something go in my upper back/bottom of neck.Wasn't exactly a pain feeling but more like a weird shiver but i knew immediately it was something very very wrong and srious.Neck stiffened up immediately.I'd had a heavy bag on my shoulder.After a few days of just a stiff neck i started getting aching in right arm which then progressed within a day or two to agonising burning sensation all the way down right arm to my fingers.Went to doc who sorted me out with arranging an MRI scan on my cervical.Waited a month for the scan then another 3 weeks for the result.Result said i have a disc bulge between c6 and c7.Doctor referred me to the Referral Support Service and i was told i'd have to wait 2 weeks for a letter which i think will have a choice of spinal surgeons to choose from.Won't get the lettter for another week then i i'm not sure what happens, as i said i think i have to choose a spinal surgeon.No i dea how long i'll have to wait to just see him/her though.Just wondering how long the wait to see a spinal surgeon will be, anyone give me some idea? Then what are the options for me? Will i need an operation or is there another way of fixing it? I was in absolute agony a month or two ago but i can now kill the pain just simply with Ibroprofen - it's like the pain has eased a bit since two months ago -   EXCEPT  when i do anything physical.So i can't work and have been off work for 2 months so far and they'll stop paying me sick pay in a month's time and i'll have to go on SSP.I'm going to have to make a claim on my personal accident & sickness policy but even then it's not guarenteed my claim will be successful.It will pay me an amount each month for 1 year if my claim is accepted. So i'm not in great pain as long as i'm taking it easy and not working or doing physical stuff and the Iboprofen kills any pain i do have.But the disc is obviously still bulged.Today however i noticed slight numbness,pins & needles and aching on left side of my body; my left arm and left leg when i've been sitting a while.All the problems i've had up til now have been in my right shoulder and right arm and hand.Very very worried with this new development.Getting worried the constant impingement on the nerves by the disc is causing damage. How long will i be off work for? Its begining to dawn on me this could go on for months and months, maybe a year, maybe even longer.How long will i have to wait to even just see a spinal surgeon?  I'm going to have to ask my work if they'll keep my job open for me.I could be off for a year or more. At this point i'm , as i said, not in great pain but am worried about the new development with the left side numbness. I'm in my late 40s and i think the disc is damaged from wear and tear and having a heavy bag over my shoulder one day was the final thing that made the disc bulge.The pain wasnt bad the first few days but then i started getting excrutiating burning sensation down my right arm.But a month or two later it's not half as bad and as i said i can manage it now with just ibroprofen. Could the disc actually be healing itself? Like it's slinking back in to place? But then why have i started getting numbness down the left side of my body? How long will i have to wait to see a surgeon? How long for treatment? Endless questions and i'm starting to feel really really down and scared about this whole thing.I may lose my job if i'm off real long term.Will i be able to do any physical work ever again anyway???

Disc Prolapse,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/epidural-steroid-injection-661399,Epidural Steroid Injection,"Just comparing notes to others’ experience with my situation. Would appreciate anyone who could weigh in. I pulled my back lifting a neuro patient 7 months ago. I finally had my MRI two months ago for suspected L5S1 herniation after failed PT and no relief from any med (I used mostly NSAIDS, but I also have oxycodone which I use occasionally for an unrelated condition-when I used it for that condition it had absolutely no effect on my back, butt, or leg pain).  The MRI came back negative other than a small bulge at the L3L4. The workers Comp doctor stated that I was fine, it was just muscle strain and I should do “work-hardening” PT for six weeks, then return to work without restriction. I asked to return to the physiatrist/pain specialist my pcp originally referred me to as I was having worsening symptoms with continued burning in my left lower back radiating to my butt and down my leg with pain in my foot and toes. I’ve also had pins and needles alternating with total numbness in my foot. I had a fall a few weeks ago when my foot rolled sideways. The physiatrist recommended an epidural steroid injection. I had it a week ago today hoping it would be the magic that would fix this. It has gotten progressively worse since the night of the procedure. When I called, they just said it was normal for symptoms to be exacerbated temporarily but, from what I’ve heard, temporary is only supposed to be a couple of days with the injections. They’ve discussed repeating the MRI (which I’ve seriously questioned the results of based on my symptoms), and possibly doing further testing. This is crazy, not to mention excruciating. As of now, my diagnosis, per the physiatrist, is Intervertebral Disc Disorder. Has anyone had a false negative on an MRI? I’m told that unless there’s extrusion of a disc, MRIs are only about 62% accurate. Also, I understand that the injections simply don’t work for some people and I knew that was a risk, but has anyone had progressively worse pain that didn’t resolve even back to their baseline after having one? 0 likes, 13 replies "

I’ve never done anything like this before but I am really struggling to cope at the minute so I apologise if I’m ranting. A little about me... I’m only 23 and have had 3 operations due to slipping the same discs 3 times. I have had 3 microdiscectomys which have always worked but after 2 years the same discs slip again. I have always been over weight but last year lost 5 and a half stone, was very active going to the gym and bike rides etc, got to a healthy weight and was trying my best to get my back strong to prevent it from happening again. Unfortunately for no particular reason my discs slipped again at the beginning of this year, causing agonising pain in my back, hips, thigh etc (I’m sure everyone is aware of how bad the pain can get), I’ve since then lost my job because of not being able to sit for more than 20 minutes without wanting to cry and not being able to drive most days, sleepings hard, walking is hard and everything just seems too much!  I’ve tried a cocktail of medication but I’ve found that everything I’ve tried either makes me severely depressed or doesn’t help at all. So I’m not taking anything. So I saw the neuro surgeons yesterday which said they’re going to speak about spinal fusion but there’s only a 50% chance of it working on my back and they’re not too sure as I’m so young.  I was just wondering if anyone else has tried it or if there’s any tips that maybe I haven’t tried or just any general advice really.

Disc Prolapse,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/l4-l5-decompression-discectomy-success-story-557180,L4 L5 Decompression Discectomy Success Story,"Hi, I am writing this post in response to the hundreds of horror stories that I have read on these many forums. I am a 36 year old mate who had a L4 L5 decompression discectomy 4 weeks to the day.  A bit about me then, as I said I am a 36 year old male, 6 foot 2 and althletic build. I have served in the British Army in both Commando and Airborne sqaurdrons. I am now a Police Officer and have been for ten years now and work on the firearms teams. The reason I had a herniated disc was that I always pushed my body to the limits and just took pain killers when my lower back hurt. I can recall back to 2005 when I was blown up in Iraq to my back problems. I would just push through the pain still squatting and doing dead lifts even though my hamstrings where tight through my running i just wouldn't give in.    That is until last summer 2015, I picked up a sofa at work whilst wearing all my kit (body armour, pistol and magazines strapped to my legs). I should of asked for some help but being a stubborn man who could do anything physical of course I wasn't going to ask for help. As soon as I lifted it I felt a sharp pain in my hamstring in my left leg but I thought nothing of it as I have always suffered with some form of back or leg pain. After approximately 1 week the pain was even worse but I could still walk and complete my day to day tasks. I paid for physio and sport massages which seemed to help and I was back in the gym thinking everything was ok, just carrying on. I had sciatic pain constantly for approximately 4 months at degreeing levels until November 2016. Carried on as normal until a hard day at work and a chest infection, I have always been very guarded on how I cough and sneeze because of my herniated disc, it would hurt like hell if I wasn't careful. Went to bed and fell into a deep sleep, that was until a coughing fit in the middle of the night. As soon as I had finished I knew my back had gone but I thought it would get better, I laid in bed for 4 days on just my right hand side because that was the only position that didn't hurt. I couldn't stand up without having to dive back on the bed in such agony. I had to go to the toilet in a bottle because I just couldn't stand up.   After 4 days of this I had to phone for an ambulance because it was just getting worse and the GP would not come to me because I was not an emergency, yeah I know not been able to stand for 4 days is not an emergency. To get into the ambulance I had to slide off the bed on my right hand side and the same down the stairs and onto the bed at the bottom of the stairs. Got to hospital where I was given Co-codomol, tramadol and diazepam but still had the pain so I was given a bed.    Had a MRI scan after 7 days in hospital where it was found that I had herniated my L4 L5 disc so much that most of the disc was hanging out. I was told by the surgeon that surgery was the only way which I knew myself anyway because of the pain. I welcomed the surgery because physio, pain killers and sport massages would never of fixed my herniation. As you look through these forums you will read that some people think that dancing around a tree and rubbing cream on your back will solve the problem, a bulge can go back with the above help but an herniated disc even if the pain is under control will not go away once it has poured out, it doesn't miraculously go back. You can look through all the websites and there is very little evidence that a herniated disc will go back to normal but a bulge yes.  When I woke up from the operation I had no sciatic pain at all, the only pain I had was from the surgery. The surgeon was unsure if I needed a fusion but said that once I was open he would decide which I was happy with just to not be in pain anymore.  Once I was wheeled back to the ward I just wanted to get going and tried straight away to wee, but this took me around 3 hours to empty my bladder. The next evening I was able to stand up without any pain ( Don't forget that I haven't been able to stand for around 14 days by then). I got walking straight away using crutches which was hard at first because I had lost a lot of mobility from my left leg but I was determined to get going. I had the operation on the Wednesday afternoon and I walked out of the hospital using crutches on the Friday afternoon. I was still a bit sore but no sciatic pain. On the Sunday I was out all day walking around using the crutches which I paid for in the evening, I had done to much so it was pain killers and straight to bed. In the morning I was fine and just took it easy which I have been for 4 weeks now, I had to use both crutches for around 2.5 weeks than one for the rest of the week. I now walk with no crutches and walk fine with no pain. Because I was opened up to have fusion my lower back muscles where prized from my spinal so my recovery took a little longer than the Micro-discectomy.  Want I really want to say is be positive, I needed surgery there was no question of that. The hardest thing for me now is taking it easy because I just want to get back to the gym but I know Rome wasn't built in a day. I have changed my whole attitude to my herniated disc, my days of dead lifting and doing squats are OVER that is for sure. Once that disc comes out there isn't anything put in it place so be careful and listern to your body but be positive. I was told to not do anything for 6 weeks that includes driving, after 3 weeks I felt good to drive so everyone is different (still haven't driven though because of doctors orders). I have seen the physio who gave me some stretchs to do at home which help a lot so don't pay lip service to them do them even if you are out and about find some time, they don't take long. Mine are for tight hamstrings.    I am off the pain medication which I stopped completely which was a mistake because I couldn't sleep, after 3 days I was fine.  Keep moving it does help, stay positive. I do have a long way to go but so far so good and everyday I get a little bit better, I never want to feel sciatic pain again so I am doing want I am told.  I will update in another 2 weeks after I have seen my surgeon. But if you have had a positive experience please can you post it because there is a lot of doom and gloom out there.  4 likes, 43 replies "

After waiting 3 months and being in horrendous amounts of pain (not to mention the psychological effects of having no life!!) we decided to take out a loan and get it done privately. Had the op on November 7th, and it is the best money I have ever spent in my life. The pain in my leg was gone straight away.  I was off pain killers completely within two weeks of surgery. I feel on top of the world. After surgery the main issue you will have is sitting down. You are walking the day after the operation, but sitting takes a little more time.

It's three weeks since the op......I am now walking for 2 hours or more each day, swimming, driving and doing small bits at the gym. Do not be scared about having this operation.

My left glute all the way down to my foot is in pain and goes numb from time to time and tingles. My doctor said it’s either a herniated disc in my L5 to S1 or “an extreme muscle spasm” I’ve done my research online and it seems like the disc is herniated to me. The doctors is giving it a month to “heal on its own” before they send me away for an MRI, and treatment. That’s all the way in Germany though.

I understand that the herniation will never fully heal and I am aiming for keeping my herniation pain free the rest of my life.  I have sciatica but it seems to be getting better. Am I at higher risk for recurrence of pain than the average, non-herniated person? For example, other people can jump from great heights and land on flat surfaces as well as do forward bends (e.g. yoga) with a rounded, lower back without experiencing pain. Can I live such a care-free life again after my pain is gone? Or am I somehow more prone to further back pain and therefore need to limit my lifestyle? If I need to limit my lifestyle, how much is it that I cannot do? Alpine skiing? Yoga? Carrying heavy backpacks? Standing in the kitchen with my neck (but not lower back) bent forward? Do I need to ask for help when moving anything heavier than e.g. 10 kg?

I was on IV Antibiotics for 2 days and now on tablets for 7 days. I was admitted to hospital 12/2 following feeling shivers and cold, slight fever 37.6c, tenderness in left flank and general discomfort throughout stomach particularly when twisting or moving. Bowel movements have also not been great and lot's of ongoing gas. I also has tachycardia on admission. heart rate sitting on about 110bpm while laying down. I stayed for 2 days, EKG and bloods done. All showed OK except for CRP and white bloods slightly elevated. Was discharged. We thought I had kidney issues because I had been exercising a lot to lose weight and possibly I was dehydrated because I was sweating a lot.  I went to Dr on 14/2 and had CT scan with contrast which showed 3 diverticula with abdominal wall thickening coupled with fat stranding consistent with diverticulitis. I got an urgent call from the radiologist to go back to my Dr who suggested going to ER. Right now am at home recovering. I generally feel better but from hour to hour I might feel some slight discomfort in the suspect areas. Left flank pain has gone but about 5cm below below button sometimes I feel a twisted bowel type feeling and upper right below ribs I feel a funny sensation which I'd give a 1/10 for pain. What did I feel leading up to this The ER would like to do a colonoscopy to rule out something bad, I guess they are referring to colon cancer because the surgeon said Diverticulitis can mimic this. I have since read colonoscopy is standard after a first case of acute diverticulitis and I am assuming if I had very bad colon cancer it would have shown on the CT scan with contrast. But I am scared to death.  Surgeon is waiting about 6 weeks to let colon heel Diet Post Hospital I was exercising a lot prior to this issue. 2-3 hours per day and lost about 12 kg. Since hospital I have lost a lot more weight and my wife has commented my stomach looks so much thinner. I am guessing the bloating has gone away and possibly I was bloated for 2 years? I was only on liquids but now I am eating Mash plus probiotics. My calorie intake is insufficient but with the niggly feeling I have which comes and goes in my lower belly button and right  flank under ribs I am petrified to eat. Keen on views if it is possible that my change in normal bowel movements and flatulence for 2 years could have been down to an inflammation which was left untreated and hence progress to an infection vs same symptoms applying to colon cancer. Any other advice? How long before these niggly feelings go away? This is doing the brain in of my wife and I. Diverticuli, Diverticular Disease, Diverticulosis, Diverticulitis.!!!Nothing on the net refers to these symptoms I have been experiencing (for anything other than Diverticulitis) or which I read on this forum from the vast majority of people that references ongoing symptoms like we are experiencing. Maybe my diverticulosis was causing all these issues A guy in the ER told me he had a bad case of diverticulitis and was admitted to hospital but for 15 years he has since had nothing.

As said my first time it had been confirmed was a doctor sending me for a 'CT with contrast' as I had a high   for two days and huge upper pelvic pressure like I was holding in a stool, and it turned out it was day 2 of a septic infection as I assumed it was a flu or cold the first day and tried to sleep it off the first night as I've never even heard of fevers leading to life threatening anything. Fortunately very aggressive IV medicine in the hospital and multiple   at home reversed the septic infection along with the micro-perf, and life went on. I went back in for another less serious micro-perf, I had TERRIBLE pain trying to pee one night an right to the ER, and got the IV treatment and Antibiotics at home and seemed to heal up good. Once I felt out of the woods, I noticed having a terrible time in the bathroom again, and went to the ER to find I now had an   that was not draining after 1-2 weeks in the hospital with IVs and a drain on the abscess. They were unable to do emergency surgery when I first came in, but now that IV meds had sanitized that area, I was begging them for the emergency resection immediately and I got it. Once I had a MAJOR pain attack when trying to poop in the hospital (I mean incredible pain), I was begging the surgeon and Dr for the 'colon resection' as I call it, and they setup an emergency surgery a few hours later. It is your normal surgery that they wheeled me into the operating room, IV and gas me, and I wake up confused several hours later. I was now wearing a colostomy bag (which I knew would happen), an incision / staples from the top to bottom of my chest, and was in incredible pain. The worst surgery pain by far was getting intestinal gases moving for the colostomy bag just by walking at all (I required help and a walker), however in the long term the   of healing has been painful but tolerable since coming home, and the colostomy startup pain was over after a few very painful days and now is non-existent but it starts out so painful you really need to push through it hard as the more you do the faster it gets moving / you heal! At this point I've had my drain tubes removed that I kept attached from the hospital (very painful), gotten my staples cut (no pain), and am learning to move careful as I've heard of stories of tearing open with a straight down the chest incision so FOLLOW RESTRICTIONS AFTER SURGERY!!! Other than that I am still getting used to a colostomy bag (farts from the chest) in public, I usually just laugh it off, however I do have an overall exhaustion as well I push through to heal faster and stronger as its not something you want to drag on and possibly get infections from wounds healing slowly or rip yourself open due to the incision not healing. I get a   again in about 2 months, then in 4-6 months I will have a second procedure to re-attach stuff (no more colostomy bag), and work to get as healthy as possible to help recovery along (I hope). Surgery is nothing to worry about, but I'd advise finding another person to help the first 2 weeks at home and making follow up appts, but otherwise after a few weeks of healing I am starting to feel normal again and NO MORE DIVERTICULITIS TRYING TO KILL ME! 😄 Hope this helps, feel free to ask questions and I'll answer as I can. 1 like, 3 replies "

Felt fine, coped ok, apart from   and low iron. Has successful  reversal in August.

He’s changed his meds yet again and has been on Duloxetine since March, firstly 30mg but felt terrible on them, up to 60mg in May and did feel more lifted on them but over the past 4 weeks has gone backwards. I’m trying to get him to think about councilling, he is negative about everything and very rarely has positive thoughts, but as ever he says they won’t help, nobody can help. He has been seeing a psychiatrist since Jan but kne he doesn’t really connect with her, he feels she has no empathy but he feels that about everyone. It breaks my heart to see him like this, he so wants to get on with his life but at the same time won’t do anything to break this cycle of being on his own. He works for himself but work has dried up as he hasn’t got any motivation to do it, he has no motivation for anything and I don’t know where to go with this anymore.

But it seemed my depression came back slightly. I say slightly because it wasn't a major clinical depression like I've had in the past. A psychiatrist suggested the combination of Cymbalta and Welbutrin (or Zoloft and Welbutrin) to my GP who, in turn, writes the prescription. It's been about 6 months and my depression has eased but I'm experiencing crippling social anxiety. I have a conference right now where I must meet a lot of people and be 'on' for them. But I feel like an imposter and I want to just hide. With the Cipralex I was confident, friendly and enthusiastic. But now, I don't want to attend the meetings but force myself to all the while thinking 'What's the point. I'm just a loser anyway'. Words can't describe how out of place and alone I feel. I wanted to visit a sub-conference within this one for women and they asked me my experience and why I want to go, etc., I emailed back, but they never emailed me back with tickets. So that increased my feelings of being an imposter. It doesn't help that my mother died in February and nobody bothered to tell me. She and I didn't have much contact in the last few years but, still, I feel so ignored like I'm not even worth a phone call. It seems almost like a punishment like 'Look what you did to mom'. I'm not surprised though. I was the scapegoat and got the most beatings and blamed for things that were not my fault - that I had absolutely nothing to do with. I could be 3000 miles away and I would be blamed for something. That actually DID happen once. No wonder I feel isolated and rejected. Anyway, back to the med topic. Has anyone switched from Cymbalta (and Welbutrin) to Zoloft (and Welbutrin) for anxiety? Did your depression worsen? I need to find a balance. You can't take Cymbalta and cipralex at the same time. So I'm hoping Zoloft combined with Welbutrin can help with the depression as well as the anxiety. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Initially I was started on amoxicillin 4x500 - one every 6 hours, claritromicin 2x500 -obe every 12h, omeprasole and metronidazole - one dose every 8h but I could not cope with the huge amount of pills I was supposed to take daily so after one day of it I skipped two doses and went to gastroenterology where after I found out I have gastritis I was put on the current medication combo. I have horrible side effects from claritromicin and can barely function but I have three doses left until I complete the week. My question here is related to whether the first day and the skipped doses affect the performance of current combination and if I should compensate for that by continuing with 2 more doses of the current combination. Also, having taken one amoxicillin every 6 hours then compared to 2 every 12h now, should I worry about anything?

This is my first post / forum on Patient so thank you for taking the time to read. I am a 24 year old male from the North East of England. Two weeks ago (Thursday 20th April 2017) whilst at work I got a sudeen painful stomach, it felt like kind of a trapped wind, awful pain. I managed to wait until after work to go and get some windeze and various other tablets. On the Friday night the pain was still quite bad, sharp and shooting, stabbing like. I thought maybe a bought of IBS so went and bought some Buscopan. They didn't do anything. Saturday I went to A&E and they examined me, four files of blood. Nothing. Sent me home to see how I go. Monday and Tuesday I got sent home from work and Tuesday afternoon I went straight from work to A&E, again. Nothing again and sent home. Went to see my GP and they gave me some Mebeverine? Something for IBS and cramps. Didn't help. My family and I paid privately at the Nuffield for a full abdominal scan and that was all clear, we were worried about Gallstones / Gallbladder. Nothing apparently. I've been back to my GP, sent in two stool samples and they're testing for Helicobacter Pylori? I put those stool samples in Tuesday 2nd May 2017 after the bank holiday, today is Thursday 4th May, still not heard. I went for a check up with a surgeon from an earlier problem and discussed this he has arranged now for a Gastroscopy and Colonscopy and another Ultrasound in 19-20 days. The pain does seem to get worse when I eat? But I've also been waking up 2-3am in pain so not just on a full stomach. I want some answers and results ASAP. I am worried, the form said URGENT. Could this be stomach ulcers? Or something simple? Would it be a course of antibiotics and antacids to clear it up? How quickly would I feel better? The pain in my stomach area and the area around my stomach is quite sensitive to touch!

Lots of Belching after I eat 3. Burning sensation in stomach if I eat something with even light spice 4. Stomach upset keeping me awake at night 5. Bloated stomach after i eat 6. Feeling full even if I eat small portion of food at night 7. Tested positive for H.Pylori 8. Frequent bowel movement My doctor advised me to be on PPI for once in a day after my dinner. I had PPI for 3 months. Initial 2 weeks I had PPI for 2 times in a day. Antacid syrup at night time for 1 month. 3 course tablet for a week to get rid of h pylori. Above tablets are strictly on my doctor advise. Diet during gastritis: Eat only small quantity at a time. If you previously had 3 meals a day, now split the quantity to 4 meals a day. A hungry stomach can worsen the gastritis ulcer, so keep eating whenever you feel hungry. Now What to eat; I had yoghurt or curd with rice for 3 times a day for initial 3 weeks. Had fruits like  less-riped banana, papaya, mango, apple, strawberry, pineapple(a little), pomegranate, melons. Had some vegetable juice like beetroot, carrot. Fruits and vegetable juice are in between meals. Took buttermilk(1 table spoon yoghurt in glass of water stir well) in between meals twice a day with pinch of asafoetida mixed in it. A lot of water in a day is very crucial to the cure. Take diluted fresh lemon juice twice a week. Avoid stomach irritants like chilli, alcohol, smoking, vinegar, aerated drinks, soda, ginger, coffee, for me even tea, citric acid fruits, any other thing you find irritant to stomach. Because irritants vary form person to person. Include boiled egg in your daily diet. I ate well cooked chicken once in 2 weeks. Hard to digest foods may worsen your symptoms like red meat, pulses like soy bean, avoid these foods atleast for a month or so. Oil I used for cooking is sesame oil which I use traditionally. Doctors usually advise to take Olive oil, which is a neutral oil. Do not eat anything hot or cold.  Many websites advise alkaline diet which is basically eating lots of natural foods. Certain alkaline foods are also irritant to stomach avoid those. Otherwise eat a lot of alkaline rich fruits, raisins and nuts(almonds). Raw vegetables(except juice), raw green leaf are hard to digest, I found it little uncomfortable. Eat a balanced diet.  Lifestyle changes: Lifestyle changes are mandatory. Exercise well for atleast 30 minutes a day in morning, but my stomach hurts in the initial 1 month of gastritis if I exercise. Go to sleep after 3 hours of having your meal. Go to bed early like 9pm and try to sleep in a dark room which enables the melatonin secretion which is a crucial enzyme for curing our body, which secretes only during our good early night sleep. Never ever have a heavy meal during gastritis. If you do not get sleep because of the pain or upset, try antacid syrup. Have a refreshing walk after each meal. Avoid stress or heated arguments which will worsen your symptoms. I lost nearly 8 kg in this 3 months diet. Alter your lifestyle such that you here on avoid your stomach irritants until you get fully recovered. Doing the above things I recovered in 3 months time about 80%. Timeline of the betterment varies on the severity. Never worry a lot, you will also get back to normal course. All you need is a thinking that you will recover very soon. Be positive about getting well which is more important of all. 6 likes, 20 replies "

Hi guys, I am look for some insight, thanks for your time. After two years of being sick(joint pain, sleep issues, pain like wound in the back after meals, headaches, itching these were just some of my symptoms and they always came with food), I was recently diagnosed with H pylori and was given a 10 day Triple therapy.  This helped a lot, but the pain in the back after meals is making me believe there might be an ulcer or more than one there.  If I eat an apple, or a grape, I feel pain within in hour in my back, it's like a wound to the touch, so it isn't your traditional back pain where you feel the pain in your bones.   This is the same with every single food, healthy or not. It's more like inflamed tissue.  If I don't eat, the pain is significantly less. I feel better when I am on omperazole, which only reinforces my suspicion of a/an ulcer(s) being present. I have an endoscopy appointment in 10 days, so I'll know for sure then. in my research, I found out that your regular peptic ulcers do not cause referred pan in the back, majority of people seem to complain about pain which is confined to the stomach which isn't my cause.  for me stomach pain is sporadic.  In my research, I found out that this type of pain(pain that you feel in your back after meals) is found among patients who have severe peptic ulcers that penetrate to some organ, mostly the pancreas and this is usually corrected with surgery.  High mortality rates is associate with penetrating ulcers. has anyone here been through this? If so, please share your experience. Apparently this is so rare that it only happens to about 6% of people who have ulcers.   Thanks for your time again. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Duodenal Ulcer,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/perforated-duodenal-ulcer-20211,Perforated Duodenal Ulcer,"I had a duodenal ulcer and didn't know it...not until it ruptured and I experienced the worst pain of my life. And I've had several surgeries and given birth! I had been seeing a doctor for stomach pain who diagnosed acid reflux without doing any tests. I also suffer from terrible headaches and, with my doctor’s knowledge; I was eating Excedrin like crazy. I was in the process of finding another doctor for a second opinion when the ulcer decided to make itself really known. While at work I started having severe pains in my left side that radiated to my back. I was dumb enough to think that if I just went home to lie down I would be fine...and drove myself home with this mind numbing pain. I got home, changed into comfy clothes and lay down. Before I knew what hit me I was drenched in sweat, freezing (it was 112 outside that day) and convulsing so bad I couldn't even dial 911. My daughter came home and found me, she called the ambulance.  I coded in the ambulance. Once I got to the hospital I had to wait for awhile and coded again. I was finally taken for an ultrasound and then a CT scan. The CT scan showed the perforation and I was operated on immediately. I remember very little about the experience before the surgery, my family has filled in some of the blanks. Including the fact that my surgeon thought it would be a good idea to yell at me about taking Excedrin when I had an ulcer, even though I was seeing a doctor and didn't know I had the ulcer. He was none too happy with me when I responded by saying \""Could you save the lecture until after you fix the pain\"". Recovery was brutal. Tube in my nose, catheter somewhere else...and the surgery pain was unbelievable. I was in the hospital for 5 days on a clear liquid diet, and then my idiot surgeon decided I could go home (against the advice of the admitting doctor). I was barely moving around on day five. The hospital wouldn't release me until I'd had solid food...the solid food lunch for that day? Steak and potatoes, I kid you not. I refused to eat the steak, ate a bit of the potato and some jello and was on my merry way home with prescriptions for pain meds and Protonix. My family took me home, stopping at the pharmacy on the way to get the meds. My idiot surgeon had forgotten to write the dosage for the pain medication and was unreachable...until the NEXT MORNING at 11 a.m. Needless to say my first night home was horrendous. I almost went back to the hospital about three times. The pharmacy was wonderful, calling the surgeon every hour until they finally reached him, then calling to let me know the medicine was ready.  My surgeon said I could go back to work in a week...the admitting doctor (who wanted me in the hospital for at least three more days) said two. When I went to get my staples out (nine) 5 days after getting out of the hospital I told the surgeon I had no idea how I was going to go back to work the following Monday. I am an Administrative Assistant at a huge law firm. He had the impression that I just sat at a computer all day (which really didn't matter, because of the location of the incision sitting for any length of time was impossible). I had to explain in detail that I was extremely active at work and that my job was a very demanding one. If the attorneys and staff saw me at work they would think I was 100 percent and expect me to do all that I had before and I was just not ready. He finally agreed to let me off for another week.  At the next check up, the Friday before the Monday that I was again to return to work, I was in unbelievable pain. I had an extreme burning sensation in my abdomen. I explained this to the surgeon, who said it just takes time to heal and let me off work for another week. The next visit, again the Friday before I the Monday I was to return to work, same thing. I was in such unbelievable pain, the burning was so intense. After basically breaking down in the office, telling the doctor that I just thought something was really wrong, I'd had surgeries before and had never experienced this type of pain. Plus I was SO weak and tired. He finally said \""well I guess it's possible that you have a yeast infection. I can give you some antibiotics and see if that helps\"". Three days after beginning the antibiotics I was 75% better. The burning was nothing compared to what it had been and I was finally starting to sleep through the night. I haven't been back to the surgeon since. I am still having issues with diet...what I can eat, what I can't. I lost 27 pounds (and I was pretty thin to start). I can no longer eat tomato based products, anything rich or too sweet, anything that is too spicy (Mexican is my favorite food - no more of that), etc. Red meat is not my friend; it causes stomach pain, as does the tomato based foods like spaghetti or pizza (my favorite food prior to surgery) or rich foods such as fettuccine alfredo. I was also a chocoholic before the surgery - now it makes me sick. Of course there is no sympathy from my overweight boss who said things like \""it must be nice\"" when she saw how much weight I had lost. (Of course she also said \""it must be nice\"" when I was lying in the hospital bitching because I couldn't DO anything). She is constantly trying to get me to eat the cake, cookies and other sweets she is so fond of (and that I loved before the surgery), or the rich lunches she enjoys, and gets upset when I tell her I can't eat them because they make me sick. She then goes to my friends at work and tells them how worried she is about me because I don't eat. I DO eat; I just eat healthier than I ever have. I just eat plain, boring foods. Chicken or fish that is not seasoned too much, yogurt, cottage cheese, baked potatoes, etc. I also drink SlimFast with my meals; it tastes better than Ensure, has 250 calories, and has vitamins & minerals it in.  My advice to anyone who is experiencing stomach pain? Keep hounding your doctor. Find a new doctor if yours won't listen to you, and do it quickly. And the best advice I can give you - avoid NSAID's. Excedrin, Motrin, Aleve, they're all really hard on your stomach. The only thing that is \""safe\"" is Tylenol. It may not work as well as the others, but taking it in place of NSAID's might save your life. I am really hoping to find more appetizing things to eat and any suggestions would be appreciated. 3 likes, 19 replies "

Nearly five months ago, I woke up in the morning feeling 'off'. I assumed I was just getting sick...again....because before that morning, I was suffering from all sorts of health issues. I felt like I was constantly sick (with cold/flu like symptoms), I was dizzy at times, vomited randomly and had some heart burn. I went to the doctor a few times, he ran tests and nothing remarkable came back in the results. So shortly after I got up, I had to go back to sleep. I felt really foggy, dizzy and weak. I slept for most of the day and evening. At around 8pm, I got up to use the washroom. And nearly passed out  just trying to pee. When I stood up, I collapsed and things just got extremely scary from there. I could not get up from the floor, in fact I couldn't even speak, my hearing and sight went, my breathing was out of my control and extremely shallow. I was freezing cold and then I vomited about three units of blood (frank). I had the terrible feeling I wasn't going to survive. My husband wasn't home, I was alone...and there was no way I could have reached the phone to call 911.  Thankfully my husband came home shortly after with our kids, he found me when he opened the washroom door and found me. He called 911. When I got to the ER my hemoglobin was 72, I was given four units of blood. Which brought my hemoglobin up to 86. I was scoped two days later and they found a peptic duodenal ulcer. Which the GI specialist claimed was healing. I was sent home with iron supplements and proton pump blockers. Since then, my health has been a complete MESS. My hemoglobin has not come up over 104, my iron count is 8, my palettes are climbing with every blood test (weekly), so is my RBC, carbon dioxide and other things I can't remember right now. I've lost 70lbs since the bleed.  I struggle to do anything, walking around our apartment leaves me winded, my heart races and I usually have to brace myself or take a break, due to dizziness or fatigue. My mood is awful. My ulcer still hurts ALOT despite the proton pump blockers (which have been changed a few times to see if a change could help). I can sit down for five minutes or five hours, and every time when I stand....I'm dizzy. Sometimes more than others, ranging from feeling like I might faint to having to brace myself for a minute before continuing on. At times my sight goes blurry, for no reason and it doesn't only happen when I am dizzy. My ears/hearing is sometimes muffled. Like I'm wearing earplugs. My arms and my legs, are covered in bruises, which very few are from injuries. Most of them are from pressure, applied to that area. Like if I sit cross legged on the floor, my feet are badly bruised afterwards. I have two young kids, and I can't play with them, I can't even lay on the couch just it be around them...because my sleep pattern is completely reversed.  I do not smoke, drink, or do drugs. I am not on any meds except a Rx sleep aid. I have always tried to avoid meds (even pain meds) if I could. And I was tested for h. Pylori, a breath test, blood and stool. All were negative. I am beyond frustrated and while I love my family Dr and trust him. He doesn't seem to get how much and how negatively this is affecting myself and my entire family. He told me it should take about three months for my body to recover (my hemoglobin). Yet it's not, it has come up to 104. But then dropped back down to 99.  I have an appointment with him this Monday and I am terrified that, because my most recent level came up from 99 to 104. He is going to say, I am getting better. I know I am not. I am hoping someone might have some advice or suggestions.....because I can't keep going on like this. I am missing my kids growing up. And I just cannot understand how feeling this way for so long, is remotely ok or getting better.  I am also curious if anyone has had a second bleed, with an ulcer that previously bled? I'm terrified of having another severe bleed with my hemoglobin being so low.  Thanks for reading this novel!     1 like, 19 replies "

My biggest problem at the moment has been a constant crushing exhaustion, and I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this? All the doctors I've seen so far have said that exhaustion (along with the vertigo I get regularly that I've heard is another symptom of Gilberts) has nothing to do with the disease, but I really don't believe thats true. They've all been less than helpful doctors in other areas, and I don't entirely trust what they have to say. Doctors are monitoring my Thyroid and iron levels at the moment (I have borderline hypothyroidism but not enough to diagnose it, and I'm taking iron suplements). Gilberts is the only thing that would be causing this, since none of the 5 doctors, 3 blood tests, and countless appointments I've had in the last 10 months can give me any answers, except for insisting it's not Gilberts.

It did not fill with liquid nor did it scab over. Since that time which was one month ago I have not had anymore discomfort or recurring spots. I know I should have gone to the doctors to get it swabbed, but I didn't. All that being said, I took a picture of when the spot was visible. Does this look like a form of herpes?

My OCD fear was always HIV but not it has focused on HERPES (genital) to say th least. AS I was inspecting my lady parts.. i see that my right labia at the top by the clit hood looks like it was torn!!? I feel like i would know if it torned. But the more i inspect it the more i notice what looks like to be a bump where it looks torn?!? NO DISCHARGE OR   OR SMELL. I just dont know if i always had this or if this is something new.. I google for hours and hours but nothing on torn labia. DOES THIS LOOKS LIKE THE BEGININNG OF A HERPES BLISTER?!?! I think from pulling on it and inspecting is why its sore now?! NO PAIN WHEN I PEE OR WIPE. IDK I NEED SOMEONES ADVICE. no insurance and i have a doc appointment next week. 0 likes, 5 replies "
Genital Herpes Simplex,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/genital-herpes-constipation--533667,Genital Herpes & Constipation?,"Hi all! I contracted   earlier this year(March). To make a long story short.. during my initial outbreak I not only had a few bumps down there, painful urination, etc. but I also had a very strange pain in my tailbone and lower spinal area. It was almost a jolting sensation going off down there. I had done a little reading afterwards and it seems as though the virus may attack that area in certain individuals. With that said.. here's where it gets strange. About a week and a half or so after my initial outbreak, I started noticing a slight change in my GI system and bowel movements. They slowly started becoming less frequent and I found myself unable to fully ""empty"" my bowels. I was bloated and constipated more frequently. I wasn't sure what was going on and explained the situation to my local doctor. I thought I had eaten some bad food. He had prescribed  , increased water intake, additional fiber, etc. The laxatives were a bandaid solution at best just providing temporary relief. Fast forward a few weeks after that and still no relief. I'm finding myself taking laxatives daily - sometimes double the dosage with barely any relief. At that point, I decided to go to a GI specialist. He ran numerous  , took stool samples, checked for an obstruction, etc. You name it, they did it. Unfortunately, everything came back 'just fine'. At this point.. I'm more or less losing my mind here. I've always been healthy, monitred what I ate(for the most part), drank plenty of water, took fiber, etc. And now I can't remember the last time I had a solid bowel movement. There isn't really any pain - I'm just severly constipated and backed up. The doctors that I've spoken to(very few) have stated that herpes should not affect the GI system. Then I came upon this study(for those of you who haven't seen it): Yale research team believes that herpes virus may kill off colonic nerves causing  . I guess the questions I have are.. who else has experienced this? And can it really be related? Any insight, advice, tips would be amazing! This has been a nightmare for me.

Gilberts Syndrome,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/confusion-am-i-experiencing-gilbert-s-symptoms--623232,Confusion: Am I experiencing Gilbert's symptoms?,"I was diagnosed with Gilbert's maybe around the age of 20 after a blood test which showed (slightly) elevated Bilirubin. I don't think that has really affected my health and I thought nothing of it until recently; I'd always been assured that Gilbert's showed no real symptoms to speak of. I'm a 42 y.o. m, soft but not overweight, I've never smoked but I did drink regularly throughout my late 20s and 30s. Maybe for a number of years, I drank more than I really should have and I started cutting back on drinking last year; in February I pretty much stopped drinking altogether because.... I started generally feeling sickly. Most concerning, I was feeling aching/bruising feelings around my right and left lower rib-cage and morning nausea in addition to uncomfortable bowel movements sometimes (either too hard or too soft) and fatigue in the afternoon. I thought if I stopped drinking, I would feel better. Aaaaand I went through some light/moderate withdrawal symptoms (including some really bad anxiety) which made me think that I had been drinking too often for too long. Soon after, I had blood-work done, general check-ups and an ultrasound of my abdomen and the doctor told me that she wasn't worried about my health and that the withdrawal-related feelings would fade over time. Well, the bruising sensations around my lower-left ribs didn't go away. I had a general checkup in September, including blood-work and swallowing a radioactive barium milkshake to look at my stomach (everything seemed normal). I had an endoscope put down my throat to take pictures of my stomach (everything looked normal). I also had a CT scan to look at my abdomen, especially at my pancreas because I began to think it was early alcohol-pancreatitis. Nothing life-threatening was found on the CT; my doctor says he doesn't think it's my pancreas (though he cannot definitely say no). So basically all of my tests keep coming-back normal. So since all of my tests look fine, I started to wonder: could this have to do with Glibert's? I really don't know. Now: I've been getting some really bad fatigue, some brain fog, some stomach-cramping and nausea (especially when I wake up). When I drink some alcohol, I either get a really uncomfortable stomach (cramping/twisting feelings) for a day or two after or odd bruising sensations mainly on my left side, just around the bottom of my ribs. My stools have been mixed (sometimes hard, sometimes soft).  I'm still concerned about this being early pancreatitis but I just don't know. I haven't had anything to drink for the past 4 weeks and I'm too scared to try drinking anything again. I'm not sure what to think at this point.

Gilberts Syndrome,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/all-my-life-stomach-trouble-611365,All my life .....Stomach trouble,"Hi, I am 45 years old and suffered with so many stomach symptoms over the years that I hope this information might help someone to not feel alone!!   As a child my stomach would make me lie down and rest and often my appetite would be very small. When the bad stomach passed I would be able to eat normally and I would eat everything. I could never identify a specific food causing the problem, but I could have an attack and be sat on the loo, until it passed. Rest was always a big healer and the only way my stomach could sort itself out. I was a nervous child and most people would say I was nervous, but this would happen suddenly sometimes and I knew in myself that my stomach didn't work properly. At the time my gran who was a nurse almost guessed that there was something going on with my Liver, as I looked mildly yellow. As I got older my stomach problems expanded due to the stress of going to work. At 17 years old the episodes of stomach trouble were then diagnosed as IBS. The fatigue and shear exhaustion kicked in, as working made you tired and the rest was not available as it was when you were a young child. So I battled on with these episodes that would occasionally make me have time off work or I would suffer at work, just thinking that I have IBS and this is the way I am. I never really ever felt well. The attacks stopped my career as a qualified Spatial Designer and stopped my confidence to move away from my family to London where the work was, as I knew that I would have days that confined me to lie down and rest. How reliable would I be in a fast paced career like that. So by know I take an office job in my 20's where I knew I will could sit down on those bad days and struggle on with out being noticing I was ill. As the years went on, I had two boys 12 months apart. One birth was very demanding and stressful on my body as he was very large and the other was so large that a C section was performed. After the births, both being difficult, I looked so yellow. The photos of me show how my body and my Liver must of been coping. And off course at the time, I felt ill. This period of time was a blurr. Obviously with the care of 2 babies, the exhaustion of two years of being pregnant, followed by two heavy babies to lift, no sleep, breast feeding and of course my very bad stomach. I felt terrible. So I ended up at the doctors feeling so sick and ill.......I ended up on anti sickness drugs to cope. Then the doctor did a blood test and continued to tell me that I had IBS and was tired. Then the Gilberts Syndrome was found on the results and I was told that this wouldn't be causing me the symptoms. So like you do, you look on the internet and everyone is saying about the symptoms that I had. Goodness, a revelation........but no medication or acknowledgement of these symptoms! I have explained to many doctors that people report symptoms but they almost don't want to hear that. Are they trained to believe only what they have been told. If lots of people have stomach pain, exhaustion etc, why are they not open to this? So at this time I am about 34 years old. As my two boys grew up my pain then progressed and with my pain over the years some other factors have come to light that I am convinced may be related or are linked by the Liver's difficulties. I have several allergies now as I've aged.... Hayfever from age 17 years, Allergy to Mould, Rosin (Sap of Pine Trees), Sodium Metabisulfite (preservative in Food medicines), very sick on aneasthetics. My body and my immune system is under stress and can not process these.  All of these allergies have been confirmed by the hospital and often my stomach will be bad when there allergies flare up. Also I was diagnosed with Endometriosis and after years of so called IBS the Endometriosis was also on my bowel and was causing bowel problems.  Endometriosis is an autoimmune condition and I always think if my immune system is suppressed, surely the vital role of the Liver and the high levels of Bilirubin must be a factor in the ability for my body to cope. I had my Ovaries removed at 41 years old and I was so lucky that I had two children, as the Endometriosis had not stopped me reproducing, like so many women.   So I am now 45 years old and experiencing days of terrible pain in my stomach, odd episodes of needing the loo and lots of tiredness. I have brain fog alot and can not concentrate. Some of this pain in my stomach might be scar tissue from the Endometriosis and I fear bowel problems/function problems. But after having  breath tests,  3x Endoscopies, 2x CT scans, 1x MRI last year to look at my stomach in detail and lots of blood tests over the years, everything single one has come back NORMAL. Everytime the result is normal it is such a relief, but you almost wish they could find something wrong with you, to fix it and then stop the stomach pain. I know get pain under my right rib cage which is new this year, so possibly in the Liver area. My Doctor says it could be Fibremyelgia. Another autoimmune condition!! Is there a link here? I think it is my liver or Gallbladder, but I am so tired of guessing and just have to keep remembering that all my results are NORMAL and I am well!!!!!! Really!! I feel a lot of pressure in my stomach now and I have back pain aswell. I lead a very busy life style and I'm sure that really you have to be completely lazy and rest to control this. When and if I feel a bit better, I will write on here again, to remind you that there are good days. If only there was help. I wish doctors and scientists would get on with helping us. Please can more research go into this condition!! So today I am sat here 14th September in lots of pain in my stomach, this episode started mildly at first in June/July. Whilst on holiday in July, probably after eating lots of lovely food (full of fat and cream) that was there in the restaurant, having some alcohol of which I can't usually tolerate at all and after the stress of getting everything done to go on holiday, I had a terrible night sat on the loo feeling sick and a day in bed exhausted unable to move. The following days I sat by the pool and went onto a basic diet and started the detox, that I forget I should be on permanently to stop the pain. All Summer I have been in pain and find it hard to sleep. When I sleep at night my stomach can actually wake me up with the pain. It almost hurts more when I am lying down. I get pelvic pain a lot and a deep pain in the same area of my stomach all the time. The weird thing is that when the pain lifts, it goes suddenly! And I almost forget how bad it gets. But to be honest it never really leaves me for long. I hope this doesn't make people feel worse, as I have definitely had a journey. I live in fear of something being seriously wrong with my stomach and they are missing it, but this is because the pain for me is so specific to one area in the middle of my stomach. I take Easomepresol tablet for the acid and belching that comes with it for me. And I have Meloxicam for the pain. But I find that I can take them for several days initially to calm down a bad episode then the tablets make me feel ill, probably the Liver not liking the drugs as it has to process them as well as being compromised by Gilberts Syndrome.   0 likes, 2 replies "

Gilberts Syndrome,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/any-advice-please--671675,Any advice Please. ,"Hi all, I’m looking for some advice really regarding Gilbert Syndrome. Dr think I have got Gilbert’s as my Bilirubin fluctuates a lot & other Liver function test all ok. Found out last August time when I had to have blood tests every couple of months due to being on Isotretoin for my  . Well since April this year I’ve suffered from Health Anxiety & had numerous blood tests etc which thank goodness all satisfactory. But My last 2 blood tests show high Bilirubin at 47. My eyes a slightly yellow & have been for over a month now. I’m having bowel issues also.But have had my stools also tested numerous of times. Maybe IBS? I don’t know. Anyway Drs. Haven’t really explained much to me about Gilbert’s apart from it’s nothing to worry about. Well hello health anxiety sufferer here. Of course I’m going to worry. I’ve done a little research & come across things like special diets etc.. I eat pretty healthy, I’ve binged in my time tbh but only once a week twice at a push. Started drinking young. Yes I do smoke which I know is bad. I did pack up for a month But started  again after this health anxiety business, which I know doesn’t makes sense  cuz I do worry about the affects etc... but couldn’t cope with the withdrawal symptoms aswell as the   symptoms. I’ve cut down loads & that is my aim again to pack up once I’ve got this anxiety sorted, as I’m in two minds is it anxiety or is something else!😫 Last time I had a drink was about 3 weeks ago when I went for a meal with my partner (we went to an Indian restaurant)(3x beers & 1x Wkd) took advantage of feeling better. But repaid for it the following morning of mushy stools, which I still have now. It’s really making me paranoid & anxious with the Bilirubin levels high & yellow eyes( slightly tinged at the bottom & in corners). I don’t know enough about this condition & if actually there can be any dangers from it. Or have the Drs. Got mixed up for another condition? Why is it that only since this Health Anxiety that things are going wrong? Surely Anxiety can’t cause Bilirubin levels to rise? Keep thinking it’s something bad?? I’ve had 2 ultrasound on abdomen area also came back normal. But what if I have a blockage somewhere they can’t see?  The pancreas, bile ducts & liver? Please any advice about it would be very much appreciated. I want to trust my Drs but what I’ve researched not a lot of people know much about it, so I really don’t know 🤷🏻???😫.

Gilberts Syndrome,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/gilberts-syndrome-as-an-athlete-589376,Gilberts Syndrome as an Athlete ,"My Struggle with Gilbert's Syndrome In 2016 every one of my fingernails turned a deep shade of purple. Being a generally healthy person, I was naturally concerned. So I visited my doctor and she instructed me to wait it out. A few weeks later my nails were a funny shade of yellow. My doctor ordered a blood test. In a span of 2 months I had 3 blood tests conducted. The result was Gilberts Syndrome. As a competitive runner I was afraid this syndrome would effect my performance. My doctor assured me that Gilberts Syndrome is benign, with no symptoms or problems. She is wrong. After my diagnosis I finished my track season with really solid times. I hardly thought about Gilberts Syndrome. I cut out dairy from my diet and began to eat healthier, this seemed to help me until recently. At the start of this year, I began to struggle with sickness and the general feeling of being unwell. It was almost like I couldn't shake it off. I would feel so exhausted, but I thought it was from my track workouts. I knew something was up when I started to experience bad stomach pains. During one of the busiest weeks of my life (I was juggling school, track meets, dance rehearsals, and my ap tests) I started to feel very anxious and stressed. This came with the yellowing of my nails and really bad stomach aches. It kept me from performing well in track, and it was beginning to get into my head. As someone who hates being sick, the fear of being sick began to consume me. It took me a while to realize that my Gilberts Syndrome was the cause of my mysterious sickness. I did a ton of research online and found forums of people discussing their symptoms, I felt relieved (I wasn't going crazy!) Most doctors believe this syndrome to be passive, so they don't document its symptoms and effects. In reality, I've learned that only 1/3 of people with Gilberts Syndrome don't experience symptoms, the other 2/3 do! This was a surprise to me, after reading more I learned people struggle with the same symptoms as me; stomach pains, exhaustion and feeling unwell. It's relieving to know I'm not the only one going through this, but scary that there's no known treatment. As a high school student it's hard to cut stress from my life, so my Gilbert attacks never really go away. I was expected to run really well in track this year but my times have suffered from me being sick. I'm planning on changing my diet again and really trying to eliminate as much school work as I can. I'm hoping that doctors will soon realize the cost of having Gilberts Disease, because it's tough dealing with something people don't think is real. If you have any stories of your struggle with Gilbert's please share! Especially if you're an athlete. I can't figure out if running helps my syndrome or worsens it. Running is known to flush out your system (waste materials such as lactate) but it also takes a lot out of you, which is why I'm struggling to understand the concept of running with Gilbert's.  0 likes, 12 replies "

Thankful for those of you who have shared your stories. So within the last few months my bilirubin count has been rising. My first test showed the count at 2.4. I went back last week because my eyes had a yellow tinge to them. At that point, my count was at 3.1. The doctor still believes this is Gilbert's, but wants me to see a GI now because I'm experiencing some pain below my right run, and nausea after eating. Needless to say, I'M FREAKING OUT!! I have four kids and I'm thinking they're going to be fatherless by the end of the year. The doctors seem completely clueless to my questions and just seem to write this off as it's no big deal. To me and my health anxiety/panic, it's a huge deal. All of my other liver functions are said to be normal. My blood work is great and all my other functions are good. The only thing is the elevated bilirubin, the jaundice (which has subsided), and the pain with nausea. I'm 38 years old and I'm convinced this is the end. I'm already planning my liver transplant. I've stressed so much, I'm down 30lbs. I know it's kind of funny, but I'm truly losing my head. Anyone experience these things and should I be concerned?  0 likes, 11 replies "

My gallblader was full of it and was removed 5 months ago. At that time I did some blood tests and we noticed that my Bilirubin is rising and falling, usually in the range of 2-5.6mg/dl , at one time before the operation, while I was fasting as a preparation for it, my Bilirubin got even to 9mg/dl and I was yellow as Pikachu   And that's the total bilirubin count, unconjugated is always around 90% of it. For example, I am currently having a cold, and I tested my blood this morning, Unconjugated is around 4.8 mg/dl and conjugated around 0.5 mg/dl. My local docs brushed it of as Gilberts, we didn't do any special tests, just the normal blood work and liver blood tests, and they all came back normal. Can I do some more tests to rule out other possible illnesses because it seems that Gilberts gets diagnosed a lot when there are no other ""explanations"". The only symptoms I have is that I turn yellow and I feel a bit dizzy the day when I notice that I am having a episode of ""Gilberts"". I am worried because it seems that the ""range"" for Gilberts is between 1.2 to 5.3 mg/dl , and that my is slightly above it, and probably never goes down below 2.5. Would appreciate any advice on what I could do to confirm the diagnosis , lower the bilirubin or talk to my doc and point something out., because it's driving me crazy.

Glaucoma,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/eye-drops-made-from-turmeric-could-prevent-blindness-in-glaucoma-patients-670965,Eye Drops Made From Turmeric Could Prevent Blindness in Glaucoma Patients,"A bright orange spice used in Indian curry recipes, turmeric could offer hope for one of the leading causes of blindness. Researchers in London found that turmeric eye drops might be able to slow the progression of vision loss in people with glaucoma. A group of diseases, glaucoma causes damage to the eye’s optic nerve and can lead to blindness. In a paper published on Monday in Scientific Reports, researchers found that the future of treatment could be found inside the root plant, also known as golden saffron. A trial in rats with similar eye conditions found that the drops slowed the progression of disease. If the researchers are able to replicate these results in humans, this could have huge ramifications for the more than 60 million people worldwide who live with deteriorating vision. “We believe our findings could make a major contribution at helping the lives of people affected by these devastating diseases,” the study’s lead author, Francesca Cordeiro, said in a statement. Glaucoma mainly involves the loss of retinal ganglion cells, a type of neuron located near the surface of the retina. Researchers have been trying to figure out how to stop the loss of these cells, which could slow the progression of vision loss. When the team of researchers from UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, Western Eye Hospital and Imperial College London set out to make the turmeric eye drops, they already knew of research that had shown that the chemical curcumin, derived from turmeric, could help with vision loss. In fact, this plant has been used medicinally for centuries in South Asia. Western medicine is just starting to recognize that is might help with treating a range of conditions. Earlier this month, University of California San Diego School of Medicine researchers mapped how this spice could impair the growth of cancer. Another study found that turmeric could be an effective treatment for burns. A study that came out in March found that the plant could help prevent Parkinson’s disease. A problem that continues to surface is that curcumin does not easily get absorbed into the bloodstream. In order to see results, people would have to consume large amounts of the plant, and they might still not see any benefits. The researchers in London thought that an eye drop could solve this issue, providing a more effective and easier way to administer treatment for glaucoma. After twice-daily use of eye drops in the rats for three weeks, the researchers noticed a significant slow in deterioration of the cells in the retina. The treatment was also tolerated well, with no signs of eye irritation or inflammation. This research comes at a time when populations around the globe are living longer, and age-related diseases, like glaucoma, are becoming more common, making it more important than ever for scientists to find a solution, Cordeiro said. 0 likes, 3 replies "

I'm reading a lot on here about dihydrocodeine addiction...it's as bad as heroin addiction. Drug addicts...etc etc. Well, here is the truth, absolute. If you take dihydrocodeine at a high therapeutic dose for say 3-4 weeks daily, then you are physically dependent on them. And you will continue to be physically dependent on them until you stop taking them. BUT YOU ARE NOT ADDICTED! Addiction is a chronic condition, framed in an obsessive compulsion to repeat the bahaviour, in this case drug taking, no matter what detrimental effects the behaviour may be having on your life. Addiction means you lie, steal, rob to take ever higher doses of a substance, progressing through the stages of harm with administration (ie. from snorting or smoking heroin to injecting it). Ultimately you spend ALL of your time looking for money or drugs to the exclusivity of everything else. Addiction is defined by a chronic, unstable lifestyle that is out of control. If you are going searching for more and more scripts, or money to buy DHC AND TAKING EVER GREATER DOSAGES then you are addicted to them. Otherwise, you are physically dependent. Nothing more and nothing less. Please, no more of these comments about how being on a DHC script is as bad as being a heroin addict. I was a heroin addict for 20 years and believe me,  it is FAR worse than being dependent on a DHC script. 6 likes, 146 replies "

I just went to local optometrists to get new glasses/contact lens prescriptions every year, and nothing ever came up. No family history of eye diseases (other than my mother and my younger sister also having nearsightedness, though mine is the worst) and my eyesight has been stable for past 7+ years. I went in for my usual annual check up two weeks ago, and the optometrist told me I may have glaucoma in my left eye. She said she sees cupping in the digital retinal image. She didn't mention IOP, but when I checked the papers later, both eyes were 21 mmHg. I started gathering previous paper works (been to multiple optometrists due to insurance change, living in USA), and for some reason, my IOP wasn't written down last year, and in 2015 they were around 14-17 mmHg. So at this point, I don't know when my IOP changed. I just know my eyesight didn't change. The optometrist I saw didn't explain or tell me anything - just gave me a piece of paper that said ""glaucoma suspect"" and told me to see a specialist. I basically came home and cried, because I was so scared after Googling what that means. I made an appointment with an opthalmologist who has a fellowship in glaucoma last week, but the earliest he is available is 1/8. So I have been stressing out past two weeks, symptom searching (now I feel like I have symptoms that I have never noticed before, can't tell if I have them or I'm making them up). I still have 10 days left until I can see the doctor. I'm just scared. I am an overall healthy person, regularly exercising, relatively eating healthy (though this I could do better). Husband and I just recently decided we would try for our first baby, and now I'm questioning if I will be able to have a baby while protecting my vision and be able to see long enough to raise the child. I always been excited to become a mom, and now I'm just scared and uncertain about having a child, living my life, etc.  Has anyone had successful pregnancy/birth with glaucoma? Did you use meds/get surgery or didn't get treatment until after giving birth? What questions should I ask the doctor during my first appointment? Any tips/advice? 0 likes, 20 replies "

Arthritis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/chronic-joint-and-abdominal-pain-678489,Chronic joint and abdominal pain ,"I have had all over joint pain for nearly ten years. Started in my shoulders but has spread to hips, ankles, wrists, knees, fingers, and even toes. Never really mentioned it to the doctor because the discomfort is managed with OTC meds. Lately it has gotten so bad it keeps me awake. My joints feels like they are burning. OTC medication no longer works  In the last two years I stared having severe abdominal pain. It started out feeling like extreme menstrual cramps but it wasn't cyclic. I had a diagnostic lap to rule out endometriosis and it was negative. Over the last year the pain has progressed in severity and included more than pelvic region. It can be a burning dull pain usually in pelvic region, upper abdomen, or a very sharp stabbing pain in all quadrants but very specific locations. Other Symptoms include hair loss, increased anxiety, severe anxiety caused by pain, Vitamin D deficiency, slightly elevated ALT. Bowels are fairly regular with some occasional constipation and/or diarrhea. I do at least feel bloated sometimes. A lot of painful fullness under the ribs. Usually after sitting for too long. I had an ultrasound 01/2017 that showed a ruptured hemorrhagic cyst, followed up 04/2017 and it was resolving. 02/2018 the pain was worsening so i went back to the doctor who repeated the ultrasound. showed small hypo-echoic area where cyst used to be. 05/2018 pain was so severe went to urgent care then referred to ER, CT and Ultrasound showed 2cm cyst. Referred to GYN for endometriosis consult. Diagnostic Lap performed 07/2018 and was negative but for some pelvic free fluid. No cyst present during ultrasound.  Urinary- no burning, but if my bladder gets to full it worsens my abdominal, so much so that I wake 4-5 throughout the night to use the bathroom. If i do not I am in the bathroom for a good hour in excoriating pain after i finally am able to drain my bladder. For instance, today my pain has been, besides the general burning ache in abdomen, an intermittent stabbing in lower left by hip bone. like a pulsing stabbing pain.

It originally started with my right wrist, and after it faded away my left wrist started to hurt (about a month or two later). It only hurts to bend it, and when I went to a doctor I was given an ace bandage and nothing else (not even advice or a diagnosis).  My wrist will slowly start to hurt, getting worse and worse, until it reaches its peak (which is fairly painful) and then it slowly starts to get better. After that I seem to have a month or two of rest before the other wrist starts to hurt.  I was thinking it had to do with overuse possibly? My theory originally was that I have somewhat weak wrists and doing simple things like push-ups or holding a door open are hard on my wrist and I injure it. After I injure it, I start to do things with the other hand. I guess that would explain why it switches, but I really have no idea. It would be really helpful to have an idea of what could be wrong with it. I have gone to the doctor multiple times, and I haven’t ever seen my doctor concerned about it.  0 likes, 7 replies "

I've been experiencing a number of symptoms since October 2014 and am failing to find a good treatment or diagnosis! I am a 20 year old female in my final year of university and can safely say this final year has been ruined    So, I guess it first started in October with a flu-like illness (my GP hasn't confirmed whether it was flu or not) and since then I have not recovered. This illness lasted for approximately 3 weeks, then I felt better for about two weeks. After this two week period of feeling relatively better, extreme fatigue set in in November and December, along with these symptoms: - muscle aches - menstrual irregularities - brain fog (my short-term memory is now horrific, can't concentrate or follow through with thoughts etc) - dry skin - dry eyes - mild weight gain I went to my GP and she suggested I have an underactive thyroid based on a strong family history, but this came back normal twice. She said to come back after the Christmas holidays if symptoms persisted. In December the joint pain started. I first had shooting and burning pains in my knuckles accompanied with some redness but no warmth. Over December/January my MCP joints started to become very swollen intermittently and painful (still no warmth). My shoulders, elbows, wrists, knees and ankles can be added onto the joint pain list, however I have only experienced slight swelling in wrists and ankles. I also have morning stiffness for at least 2 hours, sometimes stretching into the afternoon. In January I also started to experience pain in my lower back, which is sometimes so bad it makes me cry in agony when standing or sitting. The pain in my joints/around my joints improves with movement and becomes worse with inactivity, however as most people will have experienced... really fatigued so want to rest but makes pain worse ahhhh  In late January I got a referral from my GP to see a rheumatologist but the NHS waiting time was until June so I was fortunately able to go private. I first saw the rheumatologist in February. He did the normal physical examination, ordered blood tests, x-ray of chest and pelvis and a hand ultrasound. Blood work has come back normal, as have x-rays and ultrasound. The rheumatologist says its a soft tissue rheumatism which should go away soon and was triggered by the virus I had last year. He said it could also possibly be the start of fibromyalgia. He gave me a Depo-Medrone injection in the bottom and said this would help to make me feel better... all its done is caused me grief. Over the past week since the injection I have had very bad muscular pain all over and other symptoms such as loss of appetite, increased stiffness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness (nearly embarrassingly fell over on the spot in a shop at the weekend), sore throat and worsened fatigue. Just very washed out at the moment. I am wondering if I should see a GP about these side effects? The pain levels have only increased in my lower back and this pain is starting to move up my spine, with stabbing pain the ribs. My legs and arms sometimes go numb very quickly. Prior to October 2014 I had the occasional hand tremor but I just didn't think much of it - I am wondering now if this is part of the problem. Should I ask for an MRI scan at my next appointment with the rheumy? I am wondering if something like ankylosing spondylitis or multiple sclerosis is the real problem? I really hope it isn't as serious as that but I feel like 'soft tissue rheumatism' doesn't really explain fully the range of symptoms I've been experiencing? Co-codamol and anti-inflammatories such as naproxen are not working for pain relief anymore. I am sorry for the massive essay! I just want my normal life back and I'm sure so many of you can sympathise with this. I've probably forgotten a lot of things here thanks to my lovely memory problems   If anyone could provide any insight I will really appreciate it.  Thanks for reading    4 likes, 21 replies "

Height: 6'6 Weight: 158 pounds Hello, I've for a very long time been experiencing several issues with my body, I suspect that some of these issues may be connected, and I would really appreciate if you could take a look. I have other issues, like bad eyesight, second hand smoker, seborrhoisk dermatitis, which could also be linked. 3 Years ago, I caught the worst cold I ever had, which I belive lasted about 2 weeks? I was experiencing extreme fatigue and wasn't really able to do anything for the entire duration, after the sore throat and coughing was gone. I thought I was perfectly healthy, but I was still experiencing extreme fatigue, this went on for like a month, before I got I went to my local doctor, I was told I probably had Glandular fever, and that I would probably go away within like 3-4 weeks or so, I don't remember exactly. 2-3 Months went by, and I was still experiencing these symptoms. I then decided to go to a specialized doctor, who took some blood tests, and I was told that they had too many white blood cells, and I probably had some sort of infection that you get after having Glandular fever. I also went to the hospital to get my throat x-ray scanned, but I don't remember what they suspected it to be, no results. I was told to wait a month, and then get my blood tested again. My blood tests came back, showing no inbalance. I was still experiencing fatigue, this went on for another year, until the symptoms just dissappeared out of nowhere. 8 months ago, a cherry sized thing on my back appeared, which turned out to be an infection of the sebaceous gland. I was told to take pencilin/antibiotics, 3 times a day for 2 weeks. 2 weeks went by, and the infection seemed to be gone, only to reppear 2 days later way worse than before. I went to the doctor again, and I was told to take pencilin again, for another 3 weeks. After 3 weeks, this time, it didn't even dissappear, the antibiotics just did nothing at all.. I contacted my doctor, and I was told that it wasn't actually dangerous, and the only real reason to get surgery was if the pain was too much. But she wouldn't recommend it. I still have this issue currently, where it appears and dissappears once in a while, but for the most part I don't experience pain. 3 weeks ago, I noticed a non-visible small lump on the back of my head, marked on this picture.   I went on here to ask for help, and was told that it was probably a lymph node, and I should get it checked out. Which I did, I went to the doctor, and he sort just felt it, and said it was just a sebaceous gland. 2 Weeks ago, I started experiencing very uncomfortable pain in both my hands and fingers. I thought that this was probably linked to bad posture, but I got it checked out anyways. I was checked for marfan syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome and hand arthritis, I didn't have any of them. My blood sample did however show that I was D vitamin sufficient and I had too many white blood cells, once again. I didn't have any viral infection going when I got my blood sampled. My doctor concluded that this all could have something to do with too little vitamin d, and told me to take daily supplements, for 3 months. I have started taking these, not really sure if I should be feeling any difference yet, but I am not. This is what I'm the most worried about, since my job is using my computer, and I'm not sure if I cause permanent damage, by still using it. I was 100% that I had carpal tunnel syndrome, since I have been experiencing a sharp tingling sensation very occasionally in my finger tips, starting like a year prior to this maybe a bit less. A week ago, I started getting a weird feeling when I turn my back, it makes this ""grinding noise"", I can hear it pretty clearly, and it feels like I run out of breath or something, when this occurs. Now when I stand up to long, I get this very discomforting pain in the left side of my back until I sit or lay down. I want to get this checked, but I don't know how to explain it to my doctor. That was pretty much everything, I really really hope that someone is able to guide me on how to go about my issue. Sorry for poor explanation but english is not my native language.

Out of no where, every morning, it would hurt just below my right ankle. It would go away after 5 or 10 minutes, but I just couldn't walk. No idea why this was happening. Anyways, this happened for about 4 days. I just ignored it. After that, my ankle swelled up like a baloon. For the first three days, I just applied Voltaren and iced it. After no progress, I went to the doctor. He said it was too early to tell what it was, so he prescribed some oral medication. After I took that, I felt much better and my swelling cut down quite a bit. After a few days however, my left ankle began swelling up a little, then the back of my knees began hurting a lot, then my elbows began to hurt, and then my wrist. I also began coughing quite a bit. My parents thought this was all a side effect of that medication, so they asked to stop it. I did that, but my right ankle swelled up like a balloon again. I still had a lot of tightness and pain in my other ankle, knees, elbows, and wrists. Also still had that horrible  . Like, I had a lot of trouble walking, going to the bathroom, and showering. So I went to the doctor again (a different one), and he prescribed protnozone (however you spell it).  However, I didn't immediately go for it, as I wanted to wait a bit before I went on another medication. The doctor also ordered a blood test and x ray for the right ankle. I did that, and the doctor said everything looked fine. He said they tested me for everything, and everything came out normal. So he said what I might have are symptoms of rheumatoid artharitis, without actually having the disease. He said to take either advil or aleeve, and rest, but suggested I take the pretnezone (again, sorry for the spelling). I was on advil and then aleeve that for about a week, but nothing improved. I was still in a lot of discomfort. So my parents took me to the emergency room. I had two different doctors look at me, and they think I might have triggered some muscle pains somehow. So they told me to go on the pretnezone (?). I was prescribed to be on it for 5 days. So I started that, and I literally felt cured. I hadn't felt so good in 3 weeks. So I used up the prescription, but all my  , tightness, and swelling came back (swelling wasn't as intense, but it still was there). And then my coughing picked up horribly. Like I haven't coughed like this ever.  At first when this started, it was a dry cough. Now I got a lot of phlegm. This morning, I coughed up some bloody phlegm. After that though, there was no blood. Seriously, this coughing is annoying the hell out of me. For a month now, I have been taking Halls, warm honey water, warm honey and ginger water, warm water with clove, and I suck on clove once in a while to give me a break from the cough. Nothing has worked so far. So what the heck is going on? Do I have some kind of virus? I haven't traveled anywhere, I'm a healthy guy, and there is no family history of any kind of disease.

But dr. Told me the problem is -in America everyone wants to do something and I should not believe those studies.  He told me to read studies from Australia or New Zealand.  Anyway it seems like I can’t get referred to orthopaedic surgeon through NHS as this sport medicine doctor thinks there is not another option as to live with what I have got. I have no private insurance  and I don’t know what to do?

Anyways, because of this I am going to have keyhole surgery, otherwise known as an arthoscopy, the doctors are going to remove the cyst and try to amend the tear.

All my tests showed no problem in my hip so my Dr said he was going to do a diagnostic arthroscopy of my hip. He suspected a torn tendon. I was so thankful he didn't quit when he found the torn tendon because I also had a torn labrum and the cartilage was so damaged it was down to the bone. To fix the cartilage issue, he did micro-fracture. He also repaired the tendon and labrum. I fell the first week after surgery but it doesn't seem to have adversly affected the hip.  Because of the micro-fracture, I am still non-weight bearing for the first 3 weeks. I then go to partial weight bearing and start PT. That is all next week.

About a year to two years ago, I was having pain in a very specific area in my right shoulder, along with ALOT of clicking, popping, and grinding. Come to find out, it was my AC joint. Several cortisone shots, physical therapy, and pain relievers later, I decided to have surgery, in hopes that this pain would go away, or get some kind of relief. My surgeon told me he shaved my ac joint, cleaned up  , bursa, and any spurs I had, and also discovered I had a post labrum tear. I believe I got a couple of anchors and sutures, and was in the big sling for about 3 weeks before ditching it and beginning PT. Everything was “fine” and my ROM improved very quickly. Well, here I am, 3 months post opp, and the pain in my ac joint area is unbearable..MUCH like before surgery. Minor clicking which I’m told is normal. And I have noticed the very large bump that was there before, is there, but minimal and still painful. I am going on Monday, to get a second opinion, as my doctor doesn’t understand why I am still in pain. I have been referred to a rheumatologist, as I have bad cases of arthritis related diseases in my family. However, how can I possibly be in so much pain this late in the game? I’ve had a cortisone shot last month, which didn’t help. Has anyone had a similar surgery, that has experienced this, and hopefully got better?!

Gabapentin,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/gabapentin-withdrawal-important-26169,Gabapentin Withdrawal IMPORTANT,"I spent 4 days in intensive care following a spinal operation. This was found to be the result of the sudden complete withdraawal of Gabapentin. For 3 whole days I was, to quote my surgeon, 'on another planet.' The only drug, of the many I was taking for pain, the only one that could not been given in an alternative form was Gabapentin. Fortunately, on the 3rd day there happened to be a charge nurse on duty who had seen a [b]previous case similar to mine, also resulting from withdrawal of Gabapentin. My husband insisted that some way was found of administrating the drug. (I myself was una\\ware of any of this until later). There were objections from the staff since I would need sedating and was unable to consent! My husband over-rode them - thank goodness - and said he would take full responsibility and 'just do it.' Some time after he left they did sedate me and administer the Gabapoentin. Then, as now, I had been taking 900mg 3 times daily for nerve pain, so I had obviously fallen off a cliff in terms of amount taken. The following morning I woke up back to normal and asked for a cup of tea. When my husband arrived I saw him wipe tears from his eyes. If not back from the dead I WAS back from a living nightmare. WHAT CONCERNS ME MOST IS THAT THIS WAS DISMISSED BY THE MANUFACTURERS WHEN ONE OF MY CONSULTANTS MENTIONED IT. YET IT IS A TERRIBLE REACTION, ALBEIT NO DOUBT EXTREMELY RARE.

Gabapentin,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/gabapentin-or-opioids-which-is-the-problem-or-both--692543,Gabapentin or Opioids:  Which is the Problem (or both?),"Fifteen months ago I posted "" Gabapentin Withdrawal Horror"". Gabapentin caused serious fluid retention (I lost 30 pounds in one month after discontinuing the drug), memory problems, lethargy and spontaneous jerking of my legs.  I wondered at times if gabapentin was making my chronic pain worse. Cut to the chase, and the last three months have been hell since discontinuing gabapentin in July 2016. Terrible, miserable nerve pain in my legs and feet.  Horrible burning pain.  To be clear, I have normal blood sugar levels and am not diabetic.  My eyes were painful and constantly irritated and red.  I had a tough time sleeping.  Some nights I would get three hours of sleep if I was lucky.  The sleep was disturbed by waking up due to pain 6-7 times a night. It had gotten to the point where I had constant internal nerve shaking and non-stop nerve firing.  At first it was in my legs, but ended up in my torso and arms.  In other words, the only place that didn't seem to be shaking was my head.  This must be systemic! My only medication was Percocet 5 mg up to two times a day.  Not all that much.  I stopped taking it about a month ago and the burning pain and shaking has decreased. The reason for the update is to encourage other patients to review all their medications with their physician and understand that even small doses of medication could be causing problems.  I did not think this small amount of opioid could cause this much misery. I am now wondering if gabapentin caused a number of issues, but may have been masking the shaking and the burning pain caused by the opiate.  The burning and shaking began the day I took my last dose of gabapentin in July 2016.   I still don't trust gabapentin, but now I don't trust small doses of opiates.  I have enough pain from my injury and the three subsequent surgeries, but I would rather try to go without prescription medications that have caused far more harm than good. Good luck to everyone and hope you are doing alright. 1 like, 11 replies "
Gabapentin,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/withdrawal-hell-hoping-this-isnt-permanent--693757,Withdrawal hell! Hoping this isnt permanent!,"Hi all. Let me preface this by saying I know I'm an idiot and i dont deserve any sympathy. I'll try to keep this as short as possible, please bear with me i desperately need help. I was abusing gabapentin at VERY large doses-8 grams every other day for 5-6 weeks. I realized i had a problem and stopped cold Turkey the day before xmas. the first week was HELL! ive wd from several opiates and benzos and let me say this makes it seem like a walk in the park. I immediately noticed several of the ""normal"" wd symptoms: severe memory loss, insomnia, severe depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, blurred vision, headaches, agitation, and  . about 5 days in, i woke one day with HORRID jaw pain! it felt like no matter what i couldnt hold my jaw in the right place. to this day it still feels like it's out of place, but the pain comes and goes. from what i can gather it seems to be TMJ, but ive never had any jaw issues prior to this. I also noticed that i have vision disturbances. its hard for me to read now, it feels like my eyes dart instead of moving smoothly. I also have blurry vision, and i have a really hard time seeing far away. I started getting numbness in the left side of my face and scalp which I thought I was having a stroke! the numbness in my scalp would come and go, but it was soon replaced by intermittent sharp pains in the top and back of my head. the neurologist thinks it may be from occipital neuralgia, which i also never had prior to this. I used to be able to do mental math on a savant level, now i struggle to do basic math. its hard for me to recall words, spelling, and definitions which is HIGHLY uncharacteristic of myself. I'll often blank in the middle of a sentence and feel like an idiot. ive noticed that ive become extremely sensitive to sound. loud or unexpected noises will send a jolt thru my body. ive also noticed that my arms and hands have become weak, especially the left side. I have trouble moving my fingers, and get intermittent pain in my left arm. I get tinnitus often and I get dizzy all the time. it also seems like my pupils will dilate with no rhyme or reason. Sleeping is the worst. for the first 3 weeks every time i tried to go to sleep i would get these strange nonsensical racing thoughts. its hard for me to describe, my mind would just go on tangents that made absolutely no sense and it would make me feel like I was losing my mind! luckily that symptom has seemed to gotten better the past week. Unfortunately the little sleep I do get is awful. I have the most insanely vivid dreams/nightmares that also make no sense. I will constantly wake up every 1-2 hrs in a dizzy panic and not be able to fall back asleep. ive sought out 3 doctors, a neurologist, and the ER and all of them are clueless. they all tell me Gabapentin doesnt have a wd, and im fine. i got an MRI and EEG done which came back normal, however since they were normal the neurologist said there was nothing to treat. he did however give me an occipital block shot in my neck which has seemed to help a bit with the sharp pains in my scalp. I'm terrified that either I'm having nocturnal seizures that are frying my brain and nerves, or that i caused irreparable damage to my brain. every single day I think about suicide just to end my suffering. ive never been suicidal in my life, and I have a strong will to live but i cant shake this feeling. well, thats my story. I'm now about 5 weeks in and have very little hope. I have been scouring the internet for help/support and have found very little. I'm really hoping someone on here can help or at least relate. I'm at the end of my rope and am considering checking into the local psych ward which is terrifying to me. I dont have a history of mental illness and i fear theyre just going to put me on a bunch of psych meds that i dont need and make things worse. I feel like my IQ dropped 30 points. I just feel plain stupid. thank you for hearing my story, please comment or share! 0 likes, 20 replies "

Well, anything to do with Gabapentin any dose, is too high.   I hope someone can GO FORWARD on a class action suit against docs who prescribe wo warnings of horrendous withdrawal from the drug; the manufacturers who put it on the market and anyone else involved. I am now 79 plus; 1.5 years ago I got off Tramadol which I was on for 15 yrs; small amount when needed.   January 2018 began withdrawing from Gabapentin; first dose down by 50 mg.  Way too much.  Head was like I had a bad brain injury..  I dont recall how I went down dosing from then on.  Because now almost 1 year and 3 months later, March 2019, I had been hospitalized for septic shock due to kidney infection.   I at that time had been on 200 mg Gaba daily.  THIS MAY HELP SOME OF YOU.  I FOUND OUT THAT DOSING 3 X DAY WAS NOT WORKING.  SO I WENT TO 4 X DAILY ; THATS EVERY 6 HOURS. Since June of 2018 I have been on a 6 hour dosing schedule.  Sad to say, I am stuck at 200 mg, 50 mg 4 x daily.  THAT MEANS I MUST GET UP MIDDLE OF NITE TO TAKE A DOSE.  YOU CAN  GET THE LIQUID GABAPENTIN.  AND USE A SYRINGE TO DOSE; YOU CAN GET PROPER DOSING FROM YOUR PHARMACIST.   Its not hard and may work for you better as 100 mg capsule is the lowest you can get Gabapentin/EVIL drug. Since I now have a tube in my kidney and wear a drainage bag, I dont even feel well enough to get any more procedures done like the stent they want me to have. I have a low quality of life that remains; and all because of Gabapentin.   I cannot lower dose or I go into withdrawal.  And it raises my BP, I often have bad diarrhea,   And the fear is awful.

I was taking it for chronic pelvic pain, and it worked well, but it made me very emotional and made higher cognitive functions difficult. After 4 months of semi-regular use, I got off it quickly, but kept it around in case of a severe pain flare up. As of now I have gone through 2 ""100 capsule"" bottles of 100mg pills, so not too much. Never took a higher dosage then 300mg and never took more than 300mg in one day.  I've used it a few times recently (in July, just a few weeks ago) when the pain really flared up, thinking it would only have minimal side effects, but it has resulted in continual severe depression and dark thoughts even though I haven't taken any in two weeks. I took it occassionally because I thought the depression was predominantely from the chronic pain, but now I realize the gabapentin was the root of it. I'm terrified because I know the drug has long since left my system but I can't shake the side effects. Doctors and psychologists won't listen to me. They say I'm just depressed and it isn't the medication, but I'm positive it is. The pain is finally improving, I'm going back to school, and things are looking up. But there is this unshakable auora that is plauging me. No matter how hard I distract myself and push through there's this cloud that impares my ability to emotionally and physical function (feelings of detachment, separation, depression, and some suicidal thoughts). Words come slower, it's harder to focus, memory is very dull. I wasn't concered within the first few days, but it's been a few weeks now and I'm alarmed that it doesn't seem to be improving. Do the side effects ever go away... How long does it take and what can catalyze the healing process? Is it possible to incur permanent damage from a low dosage, or does it take months to heal. Can anyone explain the biomechanics behind how gabapentin can affect patients weeks after usage.  Hopefully there is an answer and the possibility for recovery, but at the moment things are very frightening.  13 likes, 281 replies "

I was on 1800-3600 mg /day for 20 years.  My physician put me on a six day weaning schedule.  The day I took my last dose my pain skyrocketed, but the pain has changed from low back to toes pain, to pain mostly to my anterior legs below my knees.  Unfortunately, it is a very slow process.  The internal nerve shaking that accompanies the pain is beyond annoying. I often read patients on forums stating they have no problem with gabapentin.  I did not think my problems were that terrible before I went off the drug.  They all come with cautions and potential problems.  I wish I had known of how difficult this drug was to discontinue before I had ever taken the first pill.  I wish someone had warned me.

Suffice it to say that it has been hell for 2 and a half years, and it continues. i tried to come off this horrible drug two years ago this past December. i went from 900mg to nothing in just 4 weeks. As soon as i started to drop the dosage, i had immediate withdrawal symptoms. waking every morning with horrible burning and heat on my face and arms. When i got down to 200mg, my skin on my arms and face felt like it was crawling but I just thought eventually my body would get back to normal.  It didn't happen. Everything just intensified, so I thought that if I I gradually went back up on it again, my symptoms would disappear. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN! Someone on this sight said that if you go off too quickly, your symptoms may be permanent. I thought that person must be wrong, but I am living proof. I even went up to 1200mg which was higher than what i was on to see if that would get rid of this daily suffering but it didn't help. I am now back to 900mg and still suffering. I still wake up every morning with horrible heat and burning face which lasts until I can drag myself out of bed at which point it eases somewhat. Then the skin crawling begins and sometimes the burning face and arms comes back as well. Wearing long sleeves just intensifies all that. I still have the pressure and pain in my eyes and temples that I was started on the GABAPENTIN for! I struggle just to get through the day so I can go to bed and sleep and get a break from it all. I try to get out and do the odd thing but it is a struggle. Because I look OK and sound fine, people assume I am exaggerating and that things cant be that bad. Doctors and other people say it can't be the withdrawal since I am back on it but it was the only thing I changed when it all started. I just want my life back.

Gallbladder Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/pain-3-months-after-gallbladder-removal-691452,Pain 3 months after gallbladder removal ,"I've posted on here before and thought I'd send an update. It's now been 5 months after having my gallbladder out and I'm still having issues. I was sick with nausea,  , weight loss for 3 straight months after. Then around the 3 month mark I started to get pain in my upper right side where the gallbladder used to be, it will also go into my side and back  and is there all day long and can get really intense at times. The pain will also go across my abdomen and over to my left rib area. I am still losing weight and have no appetite, just feel sick and have pain all the time. These pains have been going on for about 2 months straight. I've had so many tests,  , ultrasound, mrcp and an EUS, also a lot of bloodwork, all coming back ok.  Has anyone else experienced pain like this that came on months after surgery? 0 likes, 10 replies "

Had the dreaded diarrhea for 8 weeks but has settled. Have the most horrendous nausea I have ever experienced. It's worse in the mornings and I can hardly get out of bed its that bad. Some days it goes by lunchtime and I feel ok and other days it lingers until the evening and then I feel ok. Was back in hospital last week and other than a little   everything is ok. My surgeon said it will go in time. I am just wondering if this happened to anyone else and how long did it take to go. Its starting to depress me now!  5 likes, 522 replies "

Anyone could relate?,"Hi all, I've been puzzled and worried about the symptems and wonder if you have similar experience. 3 years ago i started having mild pain in my right up quadrant. over the time, it's progressively escalated till nowadays if i eat a fatty meal or big portion of beef,  i have quite sharp pain both RUQ and at the back.  and a year ago i also started pain in the left side. this pain in ender tolerence, but it feels never completely faded away.  i dont have other symptems but this everyday pain drives me crazy. During the time i did several  ， many times ultrasound， once CT and MRI for pancrease. Nothing was found.  i feel very frustrated and worried. last sunday after a meal in a chinese restaurant, i had a sharp pain when i was driving. i was kind of expecting the pain to get serious enough so that i can go to ER. unfortunately it went down after a while. mu GP finally got an appointment  for me with a specialist in late April. So I would like to ask if any of you have same gallbladder problem, mild but everyday! 0 likes, 6 replies "
