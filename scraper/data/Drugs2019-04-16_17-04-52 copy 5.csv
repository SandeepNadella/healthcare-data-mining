I found him injecting himself in the arm in the bathroom at our home. I think its methamphetamine by evidence I found. (white powder, distilled water,small syringe.  We are both young ,not yet 30. been together 6 years. we have been trying for 2 years to have a baby but after many tests, he has a problem with his sperm count. I am in shock and so sad that he has been doing this whilst we have been trying to fall pregnant. What if i had fallen pregnant with a child with a disability? I have had this ""perfect marriage"" for 3 years now, so inlove with this man, and to find out he has been injecting himself is just too much for me. Putting the puzzle together, I think he has been doing it for 2-3 years. he says its only been 1 year. we have worked hard to build a life together with dreams. he has an amazing job that pays well but we have been struggling financially for a long time. looking through our bank statements it is clear where all the money is going. 15 thousand dollars in 6 months,gone. He works in the mining industry so he said the drug was Duramine-which is a legalised form of speed-weight loss tablet that people use to stay awake. I dont believe it as he has lied, everything he says is a lie, and i have been so naiive. I asked him yesterday ""why did you do it?"" he said ""I dont know... maybe because I could get away with it."" I have booked him in to see a doctor who will hopefully recomend he see a psychiatrist. Its important that I add this- when I met my husband 6 years ago he was snorting speed recreationally along with smoking pot. He was very thin and when i met him we met in a club. it was love at first sight, moved in 2 months later and he proposed 1 year later. I said to him, I will not accept drugs in my life, so its either me or the drugs. he chose me and left that life behind him. we moved towns, started fresh and i think he didnt do drugs for 2 years after that. he looked healthy, exercised alot and was fit.we were so happy. lately his personality has changed so much. he has put on weight, he looks ""dirty"", has a smelly breath, has alot of wind, eats junk food, stays up all night tweaking and playing tv games. has thrown a few tantrums lately, throwing things, and over reacting to things. he has become abit parranoid with dirt- washed his hands alot, has had hallucinations etc. What do i do from here? he said he will do anything, but when i mentioned rehab he refused. he says he can do it on his own. i think he is in denial... for him to have done it under my nose for all this time, i feel so betrayed. please can someone advise me of what to do? thank you "

Any advice?,"Dear people, I am not asking for any justification if we are getting pregnant or not, but information about it is needed. Also what are your feelings about it? Please take the time to read the details of my situation. Thanks everyone.  Me and my girlfriend had unprotected sex November 1st at about 1 A.M. She has been on birth control for about 2 years now. She is using standard birth control pills given by Planned Parenthood; although, I'm 100 percent sure that it is the same as the ones she's been using from our high school years. Anyways, that night I asked her if she is taking the pill. I do so every time we have sex because I am not with her all the time to actually see if she takes the pill around the same time everyday. We are in a long distance relationship and in a good two years now. She answered a ""yes"" to my question. Just like on this sex, we didn't use a condom because we haven't since we graduated high school--she never got pregnant. I occasionally pull out, which is not a true birth control method but reduces anxiety on my side. Nonetheless, we trust the pill 95 percent. On her next pill packet however, the colors were swapped. The green pills used to be the inactive, and the white the active--now the white are inactive, and the green the active ones. Right after I came home that night, she hasn't noticed that pill-swap mistake thing. That night I didn't ejaculate inside her. The next day however, we did it again, unprotected. I ejaculated in her this time. I still didn't know at that time that she hasn't been taking the active pills at the moment--for a week actually. She just realized after about 8 hours that a boo boo happened. She called me crying and apologizing, and I told her to not worry. I thought to myself that Plan B should be bought. I hurried to Walmart, got Plan B-One Step. And headed back to her house. I saw her take it.  Now as I read through ""success stories"" of Plan B pill, women get their period after a week of taking the pill, a week before regular period dates, or late by a week. Every sign of success of the pill is mixed up. I am extremely stressed for the past days. College is approaching the finals week, and trying to maintaining good marks in my classes is really frustrating when I keep thinking about my fault of not using a condom. I am gravely burdened by this. I am an atheist, but wouldn't turn to abortion. I have my reasons. We have consulted a nurse in Planned Parenthood, and we got the answer ""You should be fine, especially because Plan B was taken."" I find it hard to believe the nurse. Ovulation can occur anytime the pill is missed. But I have to trust the information being fed to us.  To Summarize: 1. Missed 7 active pills of the pack's first week 2. Ejaculated inside of the her 3. Plan B pill taken within less than 24 hours, (should she have an early period?) 4. Went to the nurse, and got a ""you'll be fine"" meaning no preggo answer 5. 2 more days before her regular period (anxiety of hope we see a period) Probably, some people's comment might help. Do you think we can be if not already pregnant? Any tips on how to handle the situation if we find out that she is pregnant. Thank you for your time. Any comments are welcome. Sincerely, Art "

Panic Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/lexapro-20mg-4-years-feel-working-anymore-sadness-834905.html,"Been on lexapro 20mg for 4 years, feel it's not working for me anymore. Sadness, hopelessness!?","So in 2009 I had my first baby. I've had GAD since I was 19, was on Effexor XR for a short time before getting pregnant, was off it during my pregnancy and despite being more worried than average, I had a great pregnancy and delivery. However I had horrible, constant panic attack anxiety directly after having my son. It was over everything and nothing. I also didn't feel bonded to my son.  After about 2 weeks of trying to battle it myself, I went to a psychiatrist and she put me on Paxil. From what I remember, the Paxil helped very much! I think within 2 weeks my anxiety was almost gone, but I sort of remember having side affects I didn't care for and decided to switch to Lexapro since I had been on it before as a teen for a short time and it worked great. So she started me on Lexapro and my anxiety got worse, but something new came up too. I was feeling extremely depressed. I started seeing the world as a horrible place, and how dare I bring a baby into this horrible place. I was having suicidal thoughts against my will! I did not want to die at all, but is have these scary urges like I had to. It was weird and scary, and my psychiatrist told me to just keep taking the 20mg and it will be gone by 8 weeks.  She was right, and by 8 weeks I felt so much better! I became inspired and excited to be a mom. I loved my son and my life. So much as that when he was 1.5 years old I decided to try and wean off it so we could try for another baby. Dr told me to go down to 15mg a day at first. And by the 6th day I was starting to lose motivation, starting to ask what the point in life was. So I went back up to 20mg and dr and I both decided to stay on my medication while pregnant.  I had a great 2nd pregnancy, and GREAT postpartum! No issues, LOVED my daughter! All the way until she was 13 months and it was time to move cause my husband was getting out of the military. We had to move to a new area because he was going to school, and big changes are my anxiety trigger. So the day we moved, my excitement turned to panic, fear, and wishing we never moved despite the greatness it was bringing us in the future.  Fast forward to after we moved, 4 days in our new area and I had anxiety but I was able to manage it and was still happy. Then switched to Celexa generic to save money because a different dr told me it was the same medication but much cheaper, and since we had no insurance that just seemed the way to go. I switched from 20mg lex to 49mg celexa like I was told, and within 2 weeks I was an emotional, depressed, and anxious freak. The celexa made me feel horrible! So at the 2 week mark I decided to pay the money and go back to my Lexapro.  That was 8 weeks ago. I had horrible start ups getting back on it, but like before each new week brought relief and by 6 weeks I was almost my old self again. Until 7 weeks I could sort of sense a decline. And now 8 weeks, along with added stress from things happening with my family, I'm declining bad. I'm back to being so depressed, not wanting to do anything, no joy in any of my usual interests, in fact almost pain from them.  I need to see a psychiatrist, I know. But it's Thanksgiving week so I don't think I'll be able to see anyone for over a week still. Plus no insurance so just going to have to pay the big bucks, but I have no choice.  Does this sound like lexapro just isn't working for me anymore? Also, if I never felt this depression before getting on it 4 years ago, if I tried getting off would there be a good chance I won't feel it off it? Or is my brain too dependent on it now? "

August 28th during intercourse the condom broke without me and my partners knowledge. As soon as we both saw we got dressed and immediately went to get Plan B. So I took it about 20 minutes after, right there in the store parking lot. I've never taken Plan B before but I read everything about it and still have concerns. I didn't bleed or spot at all, I didn't get nauseous but I have had slight cramps, breasts are sore on and off and feel slightly fuller. I also noticed a thick white substance the consistency of lotion or even conditioner in my panties around 4-5 days after taking the pill. Most of it seems like side effects except fuller breasts and maybe the fluid. I'm so scared because as much as i'd love to have a child this is the worst situation. My ""partner"" isn't even my boyfriend. In fact, he already has a family and I would hate to be the reason he loses his wife... supposedly she told him to ""do what he wanted"" as long as it wasn't in her face... well i'm pretty sure this is crossing that line. I don't have a job, car or stability to handle this either. To some, i'm sure this sounds awful but we took precautions and he said whatever happens he respects my decision but i'm literally losing it worrying everyday. I'm terrified to even take a hpt and tomorrow (thursday Sept. 11th) will be two weeks with no period yet. I think it happened during ovulation or I wouldn't be so stressed. Please respond if you think you can help. I could use any advice at this point since I can't even talk to my family or friends and I haven't told anyone until now.

Girlfriend is stressed over exams and her period is 4 days late!?","Okay guys basically a few months ago i posted on here about Emergency Contraceptive Pills as i was worried , but now i have a new situation...  Since then i have become extremely careful when it comes to intercourse.. Checking condoms every 10-20 mins for holes/ breakage or slippage , holding to base when i ejaculate inside and need to remove , and remembering to leave the space at the tip for ejaculation .. checking the expiry date or not ejaculating at all inside! i also thoroughly check the condoms after intercourse for holes by filling with water then blowing air in them and there is nothing! My girlfriend usually has a 28 day cycle so i avoided intercourse between day 9 - day 17 just to be sure! i know ovulation can happen any time of the month but at least i tried to avoid her most fertile time! Last month we had intercourse on day 14 of her cycle which i got panicked about but she got her period 2 days early to my relief. This has put my trust in the way i use the condoms very very carefully but i still get nervous or anxious that her period has not yet come. Basically her period is normally a 28 day cycle which came 2 days early last month on the 12th of march , it lasted around 5 days and it was normal.. we had intercourse as far as im aware of the latest on the 9th day(21st of march) before supposed ovulation date .. we then took a break from intercourse as i would not let her cause i get very anxious and paranoid if we have sex at around the time of supposed ovulation period day 10-16 (roughly).. even though we have never calculated ovulation for her so we arent sure but her cycles are 28 days long so 2 weeks before next period should be ovulation date which would have been day 14...  the next time we had intercourse was day 17 and day 18 or 19(not sure) i ejaculated inside on one of these dates ( not 100 percent sure but i think day 17) i made sure there are no holes or anything in the condom and im extremely careful when it comes to intercourse .. i also still have those 3 condoms just incase i get panicky to put my mind at ease (i have washed them obviously).. but it is no april 12th and still no sign of a period i dont believe she is having any symptoms of any sort yet.. in the past week she has been very worried over language exams ( they contribute to final exams) that are coming up that she really hates .. she has been doing major amounts of study and is extremely stressed over these .. she tells me she constantly has a sick/nervous feeling over them.. sometimes when she is coming to her period she gets very emotional over things like if we cant decide over places to eat when we are studying in a nearby town.. this happened the other day but she is terrible stressed at the moment so i believe its all just overwhelming her a bit.. she is the tests in 3 days time .. her period theoretically should have came last thursday the 9th its now sunday the 12th and her exams are this wednesday the 15th ... should i be worried .. i cannot stress how carefull ive been , ive been so careful.. more careful than other months.! she is refusing to think about it and she is more concentrated on exams as i didnt think there was a possibility until her period was late.. not that i entirely still do .. she doesnt really pay attention to her cycles and i track them more than she does as im a very very paranoid person.. shes been so stressed lately and ive just been telling her its probably the time of month coming again .. then the other night she got worried a small bit after i said i was a bit worried about her period coming this was the day it was due i was a bit worried .. so then i just said its not due for another few days possibly a week just so she wouldnt get more stressed . and mess up exams and potentially delay her period more ! so im just waiting a few more days and ill see then ! maybe it will come after her exam.. thanks for the help guys i really really appreciate it !

But after, I became incredibly paranoid as this was my first time and next day I took emergency contraception (maybe 20 hours or so after).  My period has always been incredibly irregular, and its happened before that it failed to come for months at a time. However, lately it had become slightly more regular, coming nearly every month even if not same time every time. My last period ended somewhere around Jan. 2 or 3, I think. I haven't ever kept track of it. Sex happened on Jan. 31st. It's now 11 days later and I have had no signals of a period coming. I did experience some bloating, nausea, and mood swings after taking the pill, but those are gone now. I haven't bled AT ALL.  I guess I just need some reassurance. I'm so scared and paranoid. I've been making myself super scared reading things on the internet! I have an anxiety disorder and I am very paranoid in general, this is really stressing me out to no end. Can I consider pregnancy risk to be minimal? Do you think the condom did its job even though it slipped a bit (never came off), is that a normal thing to happen?

I took plan B almost two hours after ,( we noticed his pre cum was sort of in the condom we weren't very sure if it was vagina liquid or not but but when the condom was off his penis we noticed he was releasing pre cum at the point ,) I'm 180 pounds and I'm also skeptical of if its going to be effective on me and if I should take something else or take plan b again today (Oct.14) to also lessen the chances of anything happening. My last period started also Sept. 28 and Oct.2 it was my first normal period in awhile since its always irregular when I'm always active.. So I'm also not sure when I'm fertile or not ..

Pregnancy,https://www.drugs.com/answers/time-bring-foreword-worried-pregnancy-1382976.html,It seems to be time to bring this foreword-worried about pregnancy?,"I posted this a few weeks ago, but it seems to be needed again. For All You Girls with Birth Control and Pregnancy Questions 1. Bleeding is NOT a sign of pregnancy. 2. You need penetration to get pregnant. 3. Any penetration with a naked penis can make you pregnant, it doesn't matter how long, how far in, or if he ejaculated. 4. You have to wait 7 days before having unprotected sex with new birth control. 5. Bleeding is NOT a sign of pregnancy. 6. If you are on birth control and taking it correctly you are safe all the time. You have less then a 1% chance of pregnancy.  7. You don't need a condom to prevent pregnancy when you're on hormonal birth control, therefore you do NOT need to take plan B or any of those meds, if one breaks.  8. You can't use Plan B or any emergency contraceptive on a regular basis, it isn't meant for birth control, its for emergencies. It isn't as effective as regular birth control and it will mess up your cycle.  9. Bleeding is NOT a sign of pregnancy. 10. If you are on birth control and the dr puts you on an antibiotic you need to use a condom for the time you're on it and a week after it stops.  11. The apps that predict ovulation are only telling average believe it or not, only about 30% of women are average. We don't even ovulate at the same time every month, so using it for birth control is foolish. 12. When you're on the birth control pill, it controls your period, so the apps that track it are useless, don't let them confuse you.  13. Bleeding is NOT a sign of pregnancy.  14. We can't tell you if you're pregnant. We can tell you if there is a chance of it.  15. Emergency contraceptives don't work for sex after you take it.  16. To avoid false negatives, wait until your period is a week late to do a pregnancy test. Do the test first thing in the morning.  17. Bleeding is NOT a sign of pregnancy. 18. If your question is about a birth control pill we need to know what you're on and what week you're in.  19. When you start birth control pills you start with the color that has the most pills.  20. You need to read the directions before you start birth control pills.  21. You can't take your birth control pills any way you want. They come in order for a reason. They are made to work with your cycle, and if you stop them early to get your period, so you won't have it when it would be due, it won't work, all it will do is leave you open to pregnancy because you aren't on the active pill when you should be.  22. Bleeding is NOT a sign of pregnancy 23. There is no way to tell you if the emergency contraceptive worked or not.  24. Think before you act. It will avoid you being here begging for help after the fact, because you think you're pregnant.  25. Morning after pills or emergency contraceptives are not magic. They do not end a pregnancy in progress. They do not work if you've already ovulated. And they are less effective then regular birth control.  26. Early signs of pregnancy include lack of a period and nausea. They do not include back pain, stomach pain, headaches, bleeding other then your period. They also do not start immediately after sex.  27. Bleeding is NOT a sign of pregnancy. 28. Misoprostal isn't as safe or effective as you think. It only works 40% of the time, and when it doesn't, it can cause infection and bleeding for you and serious damage to the baby, so you should not take it without a dr taking care of you.  29. You DO NOT ovulate when you're on the pill, so get rid of those apps.  30. The correct term is ejaculated, it is not cum, jizz, or anything else you can think of. Please use it.  31. Hormonal birth control lessens the uterine lining and this can mean a skipped period now and then. If its one don't worry continue the pills, if its 2 in a row let your dr know.  32. You have control of your body. If you want your partner to use protection, which you should, you tell him. Its you that will get pregnant and have to raise a baby, not him. "

Pregnancy,https://www.drugs.com/answers/plan-possible-pregnancy-687617.html,Plan B & Possible Pregnancy?,"Hello.  I had 3 unprotected sexual encounters (same man) and he finished inside each time on March 22 & 23... IUD (Copper T) came out morning of March 24. After worrying for an hour about the chances of pregnancy since the IUD fell out I decided to get Plan B (and took the pills) on March 24. On March 25 - I had a small amount of spotting (only noticed while wiping).  The IUD is necessary because my boyfriend is well endowed - condoms just do not work but since the IUD was out I insisted on the ""no glove, no love"" policy until I could have another IUD in place.  On March 25, after spending $50.00 on condoms - and none working out - we ended up having multiple unprotected encounters that night using the pull out routine (I know dumb, dumb, dumb).  On March 26, we again had unprotected sex (pull out method) and I then went and got a second dose of Plan B - took the pills - no spotting this time. Just lightheaded, emotional and slightly nauseated.  On March 28th and 29th (29th is day 11 of my cycle) We engaged in more sexual intercourse - using the pull out method and the last encounter he didn't pull out in time and finished inside. Since my symptoms from the Plan B are getting worse (excluding the bleeding) the second time - I will not take it a 3rd time. I have avoided my boyfriend since the 29th and have refused to continue having sex until an IUD is in place - but I am still worried!!!  I am due for my period on April 14-15 and I am wondering if the 29th encounter is covered, or if the sperm has a chance of surviving the 3-5 day lifetime and fertilizing an egg?  Basically could I be pregnant? Have you or anyone you know experienced plan b failure in such a circumstance? "

I was prescribed it for ovarian cysts and didn't know how long I would continue on them (there is a history of bad depression tied to using the pill in my family), so my boyfriend and I continued our condom use, although were much less careful than usual because of the pill. We had a condom break with prior to ejaculation, as well. The last two months my period came on the second day of taking no active pills. I've not missed any pills and take them at the same time each day, but I was in a different time zone for a week, so my reminder on my phone was an hour off. I was taking them an hour earlier. I also remember taking one pill in the second week about 3 hours late due to a small emergency which distracted me. This week, I'm on the 5th day of no active pills and there is no spotting or anything. I figured it might be something with my cysts, but I've been nauseous all day, feeling period-like cramps and my breasts are growing more and more sore, and look slightly swollen. This is different than the pain/discomfort I normally have due to the cysts. Given that our condom use was not perfect (some contact before penetration, and one that broke with no ejaculate in it), would my messed up timing on the BC be enough to allow for a pregnancy? I've read all sorts of different opinions on this and the paper with my pills is very vague. I've made an appointment with my gyno for next week to take a look at the cysts again, so whatever comes of this I'll address with her too. "

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/tramadol-side-effect-situation-stop-809382.html,Tramadol - Side Effect situation and should I stop?,"So I was prescribed Tramadol (50mg) tablets. Suppose to take 1-2 per day up to 3 times a day as needed for pain. For the first dose I took 2 tablets and have yet to take it again yet.  Story: Within about 45 minutes I got a little drowsy before becoming lightheaded, dizzy, and had a headache. About 5-10 minutes after those effects hit, I got nauseous and puked. After puking, I had about 5 minutes of mobility without side effects before I'd get lightheaded, dizzy, and a headache again. I was sent home and napped on and off to try and wait out the side effects. Roughly 5 hours later, I was still suffering the initial symptoms to the point that I couldn't move about without increasing those effects and feeling nauseous. I was advised to drink water which I could keep down for about 30 seconds to a few minutes before puking that back up. Attempted to hydrate a few times before giving up. At the 7.5 hour mark since the symptoms occurred, I puked soon after getting out of a vehicle that drove me home (had to take last test for mini-mester at the 6 hour mark). Went to sleep after about 8-9 hours since symptoms started, still feeling the initial effects of lightheaded, dizzy, and headache. At 13 hours I woke up, symptoms felt less by about 50%. Slept another 5 hours so now I'm at the 18 hour mark, and I have a headache with a bit of lightheaded and dizziness still. I am currently able to keep down water and tea though. ---  So the question now is, do I drop the dosage to one pill and test it out today, or just go see the doctor and get the prescription changed?

I've been reading as much as I can on the web about the Opana ER and the new Oxycontin OP's. The side effects from both the medications sound almost exactly the same! What the heck is in this crap? Now my husband, who is also disabled like me, and was put on the Opana also when I was, is having some of the same problems I am. Our doctor told us that a 40mg Opana ER was equivilant to a 80mg Oxycontin OC. It sounds like the new Oxycontin OP's are not as strong as the old ones and the poor people that went a head and are taking them are also going through some withdrawal. Their symptoms sound a lot like mine and my husbands. Jeff, my husband, is only on the 20mg Opana ER's and he seems to be doing a lot better than me, even though he is still complaining that he is sick to his stomach. I made the mistake and drank some milk the other night before bed... boy did I regret that! Later I found out that the 40's (which I'm on) can make you lactose intolerant! Something in the dyes I think... I think I'm going to call my doctor on Wednesday, when he's in the slowest office, and talk to him. I can't take another 2 weeks of this or I'll go crazy! My 3 year old granddaughter lives with us, and she doesn't understand why ""Nana"" can't play with her... until I talk to my doctor, should I just try to take my Percocets and get by on just them?, or should I keep taking the Opana ER with the Percocets and try to just deal with the headaches and feeling like I'd rather be dead!! Any suggestions on how to deal with the withdrawal symtoms till then? I appreciate all your help and kindness... right now I feel like I'm so alone...

I was very hesitant about taking ANYTHING while pregnant but my doctor reassured me it was safe & that the only risk was a very minor case of withdrawls once the baby was born, although still wanting to refuse to take he said I needed it for my anxiety so I cooperated but kept it the lowest dosage possible. Once my daughter was born she had to be carried to a better hospital where she cound undergo the proper treatment & tests be done, she had to stay in an incubator & on oxygen, heart monitors, etc the first two months of her life. We've noticed a lot of struggles for her since she was about 4 months old yet we just thought maybe it was due to being a preemie. As the months went on we noticed very little progress & that she was severely cross eyed.

Pregnancy,https://www.drugs.com/answers/switched-nuvaring-patch-concerns-health-pregnant-1359330.html,"Switched from Nuvaring to the Patch, concerns about my health and if I could be pregnant?","I took the Nuvaring for 3 months, and it didn't work out well for me. It caused discomfort for both me and my partner. I felt nauseous all the time and it was hard to eat big meals without feeling this way. I also had some pretty bad mood swings and got constipated irregularly often.  It was hard for me to remember to put it back in when I would take it out to have intercourse. I made one mistake during the 2nd month... I fell asleep after we had sex, so the ring was out of me longer than 3 hours. So I had to take Ella EC. After that, I didn't know that I had to use a back up method like condoms for 14 days, I thought I only had to wait for 7 days like most EC pills are. I ended up having unprotected sex before the 14 days were up, even though he didn't ejaculate inside of me. I called my doctor and I was advised to take a Plan B pill. So I took 2 EC pills in one month and it made me feel worse.  I had taken 3 pregnancy tests while I was on the Nuva ring, because the last 1 and a half (roughly) months were horribly chalked full of side effects that scared me. (All tests said I wasn't pregnant). I was freaking out and crying every day, I never wanted to eat a big meal because I would feel like throwing it up. I never threw up though. My boobs became bigger and still are now. I would get one mild headache almost every day, usually lasting a couple hours. Then I started getting pain in my legs, it wasn't intense but it was noticeable. So finally I decided to switch methods. When I was 2 weeks away from my Ring removal day, I went to my doctor and switched from the Ring to the Patch. The doctor told me to put on the patch a day after the Ring removal. It sounded simple enough, but then I read the directions in the package, and it said to not start the Patch until the end of my Ring cycle (AKA the day I would normally insert my new ring, AKA after my period). So I wasn't sure whether or not I should have put on the Patch right away, or waited until after my menstrual cycle.  I tried calling my doctor to ask about this (along with many other questions in the past), and they were always too busy to take my call. I would be pre occupied with work and other things to have much time to go in there myself. they would put me on hold for 30 minutes and then tell me to give them my number so they could call me later. So I decided to take my doctors advice, not following the Ortho Evra Patch instructions. On the day of my ring removal, I enjoyed my day, went to bed, woke up in the morning, and put on the patch. The nausea went away for the most part, though I still have trouble with digesting food. My leg pains became worse and ive only been on the patch for about a week so far. The pain stretches from my ankles to my calves to my back thighs. My boobs haven't gone back to their normal size and are still tender.  I missed my period the week I was supposed to have it, on what normally would have been my ring free week. Did I skip my period because I took a new contraceptive when I was supposed to bleed? Or could I be pregnant? That's the thing that scares me the most. I have never missed a period once in my life. I feel so stupid I should have been patient and talked to the doctor on the phone. Or I should have trusted the instructions over my doctors mouth, because now I am unsure what all of my side effects mean. And I wonder why my doctor would tell me one thing while the medication they provide for me tells me another. Honestly I am very disappointed in my doctor.

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/pain-watson-lab-853-interpharm-ip-110-600174.html,Pain - Watson Lab 853 VS Interpharm IP 110?,"... I have been taking Watson 853 from Watson Labs (10/325) for quite some time now..at least several months... and feel it is very effective fighting my chronic pain. I know when it is working because I can feel a slight euphoria, and the aches are gone.  When dealing with recurring pain, I count on receiving the same results every time I take the medicine. For my most recent refill (10 days ago) the Costco pharmacy substituted IP 110 from Interpharm Inc. My cost was half what the Watson Labs pills were, and Costco said they switched makers solely for cost savings.  My concern is that I don't feel the same slight euphoria, and aches and pains don't seem to vanish as completely with the IP 110 pill as they did with the Watson product.  On paper, they should produce the same results since the medication is exactly the same (10/325)... and the only apparent differences are the manufacturers, the pill color (white vs yellow), and the identifying marks on the pills.  I've been taking the same dosage (10/325) Hydrocodone long enough to know what it does, how long it takes to do it, and what it feels like when it's working.  I just don't feel the IP 110 pill produces the same level of pain relief as the Watson 853, nor does it seem to provide the slight euphoria the Watson 853 does.  Is there any rational, physical, emotional, or psychological basis for what I'm experiencing?  Is there any documentation available suggesting that others have reported similar experiences? I need the IP 110 pills to provide the results I expect, I like the cost savings, and I don't have any bias against Interpharm.  I have extensive experience with the Watson product, but I have very limited experience with the Interpharm product.  Any suggestions, recommendations, insightful comments, or similar experiences will be appreciated "

I just started the Nuvaring, it's been a week or so being on it so I know it isn't going to protect me from becoming pregnant at this moment... so me and my BF have been using condoms for good measure. I had sex with my BF in the morning on 3/26/17. It wasn't till later that I realized that the Nuvaring had fallen out (which I thought was no biggie since we used a condom) but then my BF tells me he noticed the condom had a tare in it but not until later that night (he should of told me sooner grr). so I unfortunately wasn't able to get Plan B till the next day on my lunch break, making it a day and a half until I was able to take it. I'm also pretty positive that was ovulating the day before and during this happened. Jelly like discharge, tender breast, slight cramps.. and of course high sex drive. My calendar also says so as well. but I know these aren't 100% accurate but still it helps to know when not to have sex..  So my question is, one you've already ovulated or are ovulating will Plan B still help? I keep reading mixed reviews, some say that once you've ovulated Plan B will no longer work in preventing pregnancy. And that the pill has no affect in preventing implantation of a fertilized egg..

Opana has started to work better than before but doesn't match the steady pain releif the other meds gave me. Will the Opana ever work better for me in time? I took three oc 80's a day and 4 roxy 30's a day and that was the best relief, I had more ambition and the oc's made me try and get up and do stuff. When they changed the formula it no longer worked for me, so my Dr. switched my dose to Morphine 100's 3x a day with 30 mg. ir 5x a day. These Meds worked better than the new oc 80's but left me with no ambition the Morphine made me sleepy and I want to walk again. He then put me on the Methadone and it worked great for my back and legs and my Nerve damage. I was still in a lot of pain on the Meth. and am still in pain with the Opana. It does not last the 12 hours for me. If my dose was increased I think that would help.  Can anyone tell me more? "

Pregnancy,https://www.drugs.com/answers/lexapro-side-effects-5-months-3443777.html,Lexapro side effects 5 months later?,"I’ve been on Lexapro for 5 months. I’m a mother of live twins. Pregnant with triplets at first and lost one 13 weeks into my pregnancy. We had to do a reduction due to one of the babies risking the whole pregnancy. It was very traumatic. The rest of my pregnancy was bittersweet. I was very anxious of losing the other two. I stopped running and basically put myself on bed rest for fear of losing the other two. I’m pretty sure I had post partum depression but was in denial for a long time. I held myself up to impossible standards. My twins were developmentally delayed and I blamed myself because I was a stay at home mom. Finally when they turned two I seeked medical advice due to my extreme emotional outbursts. My doctor put me on Lexapro 10 mg. It was amazing for the first 2 months. I had energy and I felt like my old self again. I was happy. Lately, I’ve been feeling so numb. I find it so hard to get out of bed, to get dressed, and especially to my daily routine. I used to be so obsessed about my skin care routine and now it seems like a monumental task. I’m sad all the time and I feel like my medication isn’t working anymore. I hide it very well but all I want to do is lay in bed. I don’t even sleep, just lay in bed. I love my kids but I’m so numb. I’d rather feel anything than feel this way. I’m worried this isn’t the right prescription for me, did anyone have these delayed side effects to Lexapro? "

What do I do to help?,"It happen during aggressive sex but me and my girlfriend have a lot of it. I happen to miss my mark so to say and my penis did not penetrate when I thrusted aggressively. So my penis got tucked down and the base of my shaft hit. I did not feel any pain at the moment and didn't even notice anything wrong and continued with our sexual activity. At this particular time were pressed for time so we had to leave quickly, I did not release (not because I felt like I could not but because we had to go). As I was pulling up my pants I immediately noticed a very large half the size of a golf ball bump on the base of my shaft. It didn't not hurt but you could imagine my panic at the time. The bump was very large, did not have any discoloration, and did not have any pain at the time. I was out of town at the time of the nearest ER was about an hour drive away. My house was about 3 hours away. I started driving home in about an hour into the drive the ball went down tremendously but did not go away. Now it was about the size of marble, a bit smaller, and still no pain yet. I made it home and decided to wait it out. The next morning I went to ER. They told me it was a soft tissue contusion and to ice it and take Tylenol for the pain and wait about a week for any sexual activity. About 4 later I received oral stimulation and upon release it was very unenjoyable. My penis got real tight and felt like he was forcing itself to release. That marble like ball on top of the shaft of my penis just looks like a very sore vein. Now this sore, slightly inflated vein cause me pain when ever I get erect and point my shaft down. (No erectile dysfunction). I when to a urging care days later and they told me the same thing and just gave me a prescription for ibuprofen. It's been about a week now and I haven't seen any improvement. I just want to know how long this thing usually takes to heal or anybody has been through the same thing?

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/skin-problem-when-taking-oxycontin-and-methadone-328561.html,Skin problem when taking Oxycontin and Methadone?,"I am trying to find out if anyone has any skin problem like I have described below from taking Oxycontin or Methadone or both Oxycontin and Methadone or if they get little blisters and sores on there skin or any other skin problem that started after taking these medication.  I started taking Oxycontin and Methadone as part of a pain management program 10 years ago. Shortly after I started taking the methadone I started getting little pimple like sores on my arms. Then Oxycontin was added along with the Methadone. Shortly after starting the Oxycontin I started getting little pimple like blister filled with fluid on the palms of my hand and the soles of my feet. It didn’t take long and I started to get larger patches of skin that fluid would build under and then the skin would get thick and hard and come off leaving the skin under it very tender and it would sting like a when you pop a blister and fluid would drain from the area where the skin came off. As time went on I kept getting more of these patches of skin with fluid under it that would get thick and come off until nearly all of the skin on the palms of my hand, finger, toes and the soles of my feet were losing the skin this way. As time when on the skin on my hand and feet callused and when the skin gets thick and hard from this fluid they become very painful to the tender skin under it. If I wash my hand and feet it dries this thick skin out which only makes it hurt worse. In order to get any relief from the pain when the skin gets thick and hard it to use a finger nail clipper and a razor and try to thin the thick skin with out getting all the way down to the tender skin where the fluid comes from. When I take less Methadone or Oxycontin my hands and feet has less fluid coming from them and the skin doesn’t get thick and hard as fast. When I increase the Methadone or Oxycontin the fluid increases and the skin get thick and hard. "

I do not take them very often so that I don't have to worry so much about potential addiction problems -- it's prescribed .5mg/day for 30 days -- I find myself taking it once a week.  I have been having chronic stomach pains that feel like severe indigestion or what I imagine an ulcer would feel like -- and have been treating those with OTC like Prilosec without much success. I get these if not daily then every other day, every two or three days tops -- in other words, not constantly but still very often.  Today when I experienced these pains, after suffering through them for a few hours, I took a Klonopin and noticed that, within minutes, the pain subsided.  Can anxiety manifest itself in this way, and if so, is this the right way to be treating it? This doesn't seem like a panic attack in the traditional sense to me, so is this what I should be taking to remedy it? Is all the stomach problems really just a sign of being super-anxious?

I had my Administrative Law Judge hearing last September and was denied and now in appeals. I heard that less than 2% are approved or ALJ decision overturned. I have two questions. First has anyone had any success recently with being accepted for these conditions? The judge said that there was no medical tests proving my disability, but my lawyer has five different Dr.s that I have seen over the past 7 years that say that I am disabled. They filled out all the forms and everything. There is no test that proves those conditions but I do have an X-ray showing degenerative back disease.  The judge based his decision off of the fact that there where no medical tests proving my disability plus their Dr. who did not see me said that I was not and a one time visit to one of their Psych Dr.'s said that I was not.

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/what-does-non-compliance-mean-with-discharge-from-48495.html,What does non-compliance mean with discharge from a pain specialist?,"I was recently in the care of a pain specialist/spine doctor. I was given an injection and thought it helped. A couple of weeks later, I had to go to an urgent care place because of a really bad spasm. After an xray and mri I found out I have three herniated discs in my neck. Knowing this I want to go to a different place with more of a reputation for this kind of thing. I never got medications from anyone other than that doctor. They never did an xray or mri. For all I know they made me worse doing the injection. I am upset because I didn't realize the seriousness of the agreement. The new doc I want to go to I went to her about 3 years ago and now want to return to her care. She is a spine doctor not pain specialist. The doc who did the injection thought it was my facet joint. I didn't know I had to break the contract. My regular doctor had a copy of my agreement in my chart so I wouldn't do anything I wasn't supposed to. When I saw him and gave him a copy of the report on my neck he said he would try to get me in sooner than I could on my own with the new dr. This being my first time with a pain specialist and I have only been a patient there for two months I didn't know I had to get out of the agreement. I had no refills, was going to cancel my next appointment, and move on. My reg. doc. wrote me a different pain medication (he knew about the contract) so when I went to fill it there became this mess like I was doing something wrong. He didn't tell me I needed to cancel my agreement with them I just assumed the worse thing they would do if I did try to get meds from somewhere else they wouldn't take me as a patient anymore. I didn't know there was some sort of database. I told the dr. at the urgent care that I had a dr. and had meds. I didn't receive any kind of medication from them. They gave me a shot to help with the spasm, but it was non-narcotic and they told me I could drive right after. I am just really upset because I feel like I did everything I was supposed to do and now I left the pain dr.s care because I wanted to go somewhere else. Also, she was out of network with my insurance. The new place is covered by my insurance. I have to change because I don't know what I am looking at to get myself better. I am so afraid when I go to my new appt. I don't know if the pain specialists notify other drs. in the area or if the ""non-compliance"" will show up. I am just worried because I am in a lot of pain and I don't want it to look like I did something wrong and it affect my care. The new dr. may think I am just looking for meds and I just want to get better. I am mostly upset because I am being accused of doing something I didn't do. I should have asked more questions about the agreement. That is my fault. But, I trusted my regular doctor and I wish he would have told me to get released from them first. "

It was not prescribed, I just lied on an internet site and they gladly provided the evil little pill. I am not blaming the internet site, it was my decision, but everything I had heard said it was not addictive. It worked great, and I felt wonderful after taking it. I began to take more and more just for the euphoria. Then I started noticing that I was losing weight... not always a bad thing, but I had gone from 180 to 135 pounds in just over a year. My family was worried of course and I was not comfortable admitting that I was using a drug I was obtaining without a legitimate prescription. So, I decided to quit. I first tried cold turkey and quickly realized that I was not strong enough to handle the withdrawl symptoms... it really kicked my ass.  At my worst, I was taking 400 mgs a day. I have been tapering the dose for the last four weeks and I am down to just 100 mgs a day, but I am feeling the pain almost as bad as cold turkey. I am taking a week off work to finish my quitting plan and I am really afraid I cant do it. I just feel so alone and weak against this drug. I will stick to my schedule, but honestly a bullet to the head would be an improvement on my health right now. I am going to crawl into a hole and not come out until I have it beat. Its a matter of taking back control of my life and I swear I will never touch this crap again if I get out alive.   Just a word of warning to any recreational drug users, stay away from this poison! It grabs you and refuses to let go. I have tried to quit before, but I have never been this close. Please pray for me and tell your doctors that insist that Tramadol is not habit forming that they can just keep the drug company hush money and their bad advice to themselves. "

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/pain-management-requirements-and-marijuana-206296.html,Pain management requirements and marijuana?,"Years ago I was assaulted at work, and wound up with chronic, intermittent pain. Occasionally some days are fine, many can be done with 800mg ibuprophen throughout the day. Then there are the days where I have to sit very still, even sleep in a chair with a tall back. And this is with using pain meds and muscle relaxers. Without, the pain and muscle spasms increase to the point of uncontrollable vomiting and a trip to the emergency room. There are also days where I can gingerly function with the pain meds, muscle relaxers, and ibuprophen. I take Soma and Tramadol - APAP. 90 of the Tramadol last for about 3 months. The problem is that my family doctor said he can't continue to write prescriptions for pain meds. He said he would have to refer me to a pain management doctor. So I went. They gave me a muscle relaxer which didn't work instead of the Soma (my doctor wrote a new prescription for it). I told them I still had some Tramadol, so they didn't give me anything for the pain. But they did tell me that I would have to take regular drug tests. No problem. But I do like to smoke marijuana, and do so about once a week when I go out. They said it's because it's illegal. In New York state it isn't even a crime! Possession of under 25g gets a civil citation, and a fine of $100. But does this mean they are also entitled to research my life to see if I am doing anything else illegal? Perhaps I'm driving without insurance! Is it for health concerns? I find it hard to believe, because they don't monitor alcohol consumption in any way (aside from asking questions). I don't see why even a trace of marijuana use would get me kicked out of pain management. It's not as if I am all of a sudden pain free. They could give me no other reasons and it seems as if it is just a morality judgement. Is this a hard fast rule for all pain management practices? It seems awfully petty and controlling. "
Pregnancy,https://www.drugs.com/answers/tri-sprintec-cyst-pregnant-789594.html,"Tri-Sprintec, Cyst or Pregnant?","I will start off by saying that I am very good at taking my pills perfectly. I take it every single day, at the exact same time everyday. I usually stop what I am doing so that I can ensure I take it properly. I had unprotected sex (sex without a condom, just tri-sprintec, so technically protected) during my second week of pills last month and again during the third week of pills last month. When it came time for my period, my period came ON TIME and was COMPLETELY normal in heaviness. However, i passed two clots that looked smaller than dimes, but still big for me. They looked like skin almost. The first week back on the pill I felt normal. Now I am on the second week and for the past few days I have been feeling bleh. My boobs are sore and I bloat so easily when I eat. I have pains all throughout my stomach when I eat too, and overall nausea sometimes. I also get occassional sharp pains in my middle left side and sometimes my middle right side. But they usually go away after a few minutes. I posted a question a couple months back and I told you I had food poisoning. My doctors confirmed that I did. I also went to my OB/GYN a couple of days before having sex the first time and she found that I have a cyst on my right ovary. My OB/Gyn is watching the cyst and I will have to go back to make sure it goes away. So could these things be caused from having this cyst? Or could I somehow be pregnant? I strongly feel like becoming pregnant on this pill with the way I have been taking it is highly unlikely, but there is always that chance, right? "

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/dentist-hydrocodone-521632.html,How to ask dentist about hydrocodone?,"Hi everyone I was recently diagnosed with chronic TMJ and i have always had bad canker sore breakouts. The Dr who told me I have TMJ gave me Clonzapem - did nothing to help the pain and made me feel loopy if I took too many Celebrex - They came in packs of three which I (stupidly) thought meant take all three at once. They wrecked my stomach, I was vomiting blood and sick as a dog for a day. I have taken just a few (1 at a time) since then, and they give me stomach discomfort with no jaw pain relief at best. after a few days, I tried Tramadol and Lortab 5/500 which I found leftover in my medicine cabinet. The tramadol did nothing but the lortab actually helped, so I called my doc and asked for a prescription - he told me ""that's suspicious"" and gave me a prescription for Methocarbamol (which does nothing - even if I take 2-3 at once) I then made an appointment with my dentist who I have seen since I was little, he's the one who had written the lortab prescription in the first place (for my wisdom teeth last year).  He gave me a custom mouth guard to keep my jaw from clenching, and a prescription for 16 Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen with 0 refills. The mouth guard seems to be helping. The pills help a lot - it seems like 1.5 is the right amount for me to take because if I take 2 it will start to hurt my stomach a bit, which I think is the acetaminophen. Here's the thing - I have a follow-up appointment tomorrow, and I want to ask my dentist about getting a hydrocodone ONLY prescription so no acetaminophen. Is this too suspicious? What about if I asked for just a refill instead? It seems like people are very wary of prescribing this, but it's the only thing that has helped me. I'm not abusing it, it's just the only thing that actually helps. Being a 20 year old male, I'm sure it can look very suspicious, but what else can I do? Is there a less ""suspicious"" medicine that I can ask for that will help? I'm afraid I'm going to run out soon and with no refill I have to admit I'm nervous. I don't see myself needing this all the time down the line - because the TMJ really comes in flare-ups, but I want to be able to have pain relief for those flare ups.  Basically, I want to know, what is the best way to approach my dentist about getting this. What would reinforce to him that I am not looking to get high, just medicate the pain when I have it. Thanks to anyone who read! "

Fortunately I don't have any pain, but partially paralyzed. After a decade of denial, depression, dealing, and eventually finding an understanding partner, I decided to try Taladonifl (or whatever it's called, but you know what I mean- cialis). It gives me insane heart burn, for about as long as the pill is ""working."" I get heartburn bad enough when I drink coffee or alcohol, so I try to just drink tea, take it easy with the drinking, and avoid pizza, but I've never had it this bad and constant - it's worse than the first time I had heartburn, when I turned 20 and drank 30 shots of espresso. Grandma had a heart-murmur and a lot of bypass, double bypass, and triple bypass surgeries - family legend has it that she was one of the first people to ever have their hearts massaged, the developer of that procedure just having happened to be on hand. And I have a bit of diabetes in my family history, but mostly because they were eating midwestern farmer portions without the farm-work. I don't put butter on my gravy and biscuits; that is, I don't eat myself silly as much as they do (or did), but I'm also very inactive, so I'm at my personal record weight of 195, 5' 9"" and 30 years old. Now I just had a wisdom tooth taken out and it hurts as bad or worse than having staples holding a skingraft in my foot being cut with wire cutters and pulled out of me. So I've been taking oxycodone. But now the weekend is coming up and this is one of the last weeks my new wife and I will have the house to ourselves before my motherinlaw moves in. What I want to know is, on a 1-10 scale, with 1 being no problem, how likely am I to die if I take Oxycodone while on Cialis?  Had a hard time researching this myself, with all the spam pages about Cialis out there. Sorry for being long-winded. Thanks for the help. "

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/why-would-oxycodone-not-show-up-in-a-urine-drug-434147.html,Why would oxycodone not show up in a urine drug test if I have taken it daily for several years?,"I was prescribed Vytorin in late 2006 for cholesterol. 2-3 weeks after beginning a daily regimen, my muscles all over my body began aching and cramping constantly. Extremely painful and debilitating. I went to my doctor immediately, but they were clueless. In January 2008 when the pharmaceutical company finally released their test information that they had finished in 2006 (the delay was because they were making about 5 billion a year on the drug and the drug did not work as advertised; why tell anyone if you can get away with it?), and my pharmacist informed me that he thought he now knew what was causing my pain. I quit taking it immediately and my upper body began almost immediately to resolve, but my lower body never has and I can no longer work as I am in pain 24/7. Eventually I was sent to a pain management physician who has sent me to other specialists and so far they've not been able to do anything to help except prescribe me pain meds to mitigate. I have been taking Norco and oxycodone every day to attempt to mitigate the pain. Sometimes it's effective, other times it's not so effective. However, the Florida governor recently has been after ""pill mills"" and has been scaring the pain management physicians and threatening them with loss of license. I have what my primary care physician calls a high metabolism for certain drugs especially pain killers. To describe, I had a colonoscopy go bad and had to be taken to an ER whereupon they gave me a shot of dilaudid. The nurse returned, left and came back with a physician telling him he had given me enough dilaudid to knock over a horse and I was just sitting up having a conversation with the person who took me to the hospital. They told me I should been almost unconscious. Another time, for a kidney stone, I was given dilaudid again. The doctor noted it wasn't effective and gave me another. It helped some, but I was still able to sit up and have an intelligent, lucid conversation with him. On another note, in lieu of another prescription, I have to drink up to 100 ounces of water and gatorade a day to keep from getting orthostatic hypotension where my blood pressure drops. Anyway, I was recently asked to give a urine sample at my pain management physician's office and last Friday, June 22, 2011, they informed me the test showed up negative for oxycodone, inferring that I was breaking our agreement and putting me in a situation where they may not prescribe it for me anymore. It's like they were almost accusing me of being a criminal. I haven't slept except for a couple of hours the past 3 days. Since the pain management physician was not present, another physician gave me just enough for 14 days at which time I will have to go back to see my regular physician, pay extra and perhaps the full amount that she charges as the insurance company may not pay for two visits in a month, and also pay for additional pills (basically doubling my normal monthly payment which I can't really afford as I am not independently wealthy like most of us), that is if I get any at all. Why would the oxycodone (15mg a night cut in two for two 7.5mg doses as my body burns through 15mg as quickly as 7.5mg; I also take Norco 4 times a day, so in all I have to take meds every 4 hours to realize some sort of continuous pain relief; they've tried Oxycontin, a time released pain killer, but it was like taking a sugar pill, it did nothing for my pain) not show up in a urine drug test if I have been taking it every night for almost five years???

I don't take them, nor do my parents who are 77 and 83. However, I realize that many reading this are in a transition phase or simply unwilling to get off of them at this time. The information in this article can save you enormous amounts of money if you are throwing away your medications because you are following the inaccurately listed expirations dates on the prescription bottle. Prescription drugs typically have an expiration date of one to five years, and if you're like most people, you would probably think twice before taking a medication past its expiration date. Medication turnover based on stated expiration dates also costs the medical industry, such as hospitals, pharmacies, and the US military, billions of dollars. According to a new study,1 prescription drugs can actually remain sufficiently potent well past their expiration date, as long as it's unopened. (It's important to remember that drugs need to be stored properly, as humidity, temperature and exposure to light can affect the drug's shelf life.) Prescription Drugs Still Viable Up to 40 Years Past Their Expiration Date, Study Finds The researchers analyzed eight prescription drugs that expired between 28 and 40 years ago, and found that most were just as potent as when they were made. The drugs included 14 active ingredients, including aspirin, codeine and hydrocodone, and in 86 percent of the cases, there was still at least 90 percent of the active ingredient left in the drug, which is within the limits allowed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Any given batch of a drug may contain anywhere between 90-110 percent of the amount of the active ingredient stated on the label. As reported by CNN Health:2 ""It's impossible to say from the study results alone whether the eight drugs would be effective if used today, but 'there's no reason to think that they're not,' says Lee Cantrell, the lead author of the study... Two of the tested ingredients, aspirin and amphetamine, consistently fell below the 90 percent threshold, as did one sample of the painkiller phenacetin...  'All [the expiration date] means from the manufacturers' standpoint is that they're willing to guarantee the potency and efficacy for the drug for that long,' he says. 'It has nothing to do with the actual shelf life.' The fact that expiration dates appear to be somewhat arbitrary may mean that consumers and pharmacies alike are throwing away perfectly good medicine. And this has important implications for drug shortages and especially health care costs, the researchers say. 'We're spending billions and billions on medications and medication turnover,' Cantrell says. 'If a drug has expired, you've got to throw it away, it goes into a landfill, and you have to get a new prescription. This could potentially have a significant impact on cost.' Although consistently taking depleted prescription drugs could certainly cause complications, expired drugs are generally safe. In the medical literature there is only one example of an expired drug that became toxic, and that was an isolated incident, says Cantrell, the director of the San Diego division of the California Poison Control System."" This supports previous findings by the US military, which found that 90 percent of the drugs tested were potent far past their original expiration date, at least one drug was still good after 15 years. There are exceptions of course. Nitroglycerin, insulin and liquid antibiotics are three drugs that do NOT tend to keep well past their expiration date. According to a report by The Wall Street Journal from 2000: ""... Francis Flaherty says he has concluded that expiration dates put on by manufacturers typically have no bearing on whether a drug is usable for longer. Mr. Flaherty notes that a drug maker is required to prove only that a drug is still good on whatever expiration date the company chooses to set. The expiration date doesn't mean, or even suggest, that the drug will stop being effective after that, nor that it will become harmful. 'Manufacturers put expiration dates on for marketing, rather than scientific, reasons,' says Mr. Flaherty, a pharmacist at the FDA until his retirement last year. 'It's not profitable for them to have products on a shelf for 10 years. They want turnover.'"" Cantrell again suggests expiration dating of drugs might need to be reevaluated, and it sounds like a good idea to me. The pharmaceutical industry can easily bilk extra money out of the medical system by stating a drug will expire after one year, when in fact it can safely last several years – perhaps several decades! Overall, it's a massive waste of money, but what's worse, unnecessary medication turnover also contributes to water contamination, which is becoming an increasingly troublesome concern. You're Probably Drinking Someone Else's Drugs...  The federal government advises throwing most unused or expired medications into the trash rather than flushing them down the toilet, but water testing across the US shows that no matter how the drugs are disposed, they have a tendency to end up in water. For example, a 2008 Associated Press investigation found that the drinking water of at least 51 million Americans contained minute concentrations of a multitude of drugs:3 Philadelphia tested positive for 56 pharmaceuticals or byproducts in treated drinking water, including medicines for pain, infection, high cholesterol, asthma, epilepsy, mental illness and heart problems. The city's watersheds tested positive for 63 different medications or byproducts Southern California drinking water had detectable levels of anti-epileptic and anti-anxiety medications A metabolized angina medicine and the mood-stabilizing carbamazepine was found in drinking water in Northern New Jersey, and San Francisco's drinking water was found to be laced with a sex hormone Flushing expired medications down the toilet is not the only way these drugs enter the water supplies. When you take a drug, you also eliminate a fraction of it and/or its byproducts through your urine. Drugs have also been detected in the water at landfills, confirming suspicions that pharmaceuticals thrown into household trash still end up in our water supplies. Water that drains through landfills, known as leach rate, eventually ends up in rivers. And although not all states source drinking water from rivers, many do. In addition to the chlorine, fluoride and disinfection byproducts (DBPs) this is yet another powerful reason to avoid drinking tap water unless it is filtered. The federal government does not require water treatment plants to test for drugs, and there are no safety limits for drugs in water. Making matters worse, standard water treatment does NOT filter out drugs. It's also important to realize that bottled water is oftentimes nothing more than tap water, which may or may not have received additional treatment, and bottlers typically do not screen for pharmaceuticals in the water either. Many home filtration systems are similarly untested in terms of their ability to filter out drugs. According to a comprehensive survey of U.S. drinking water,4 10 of the most frequently detected toxic pharmaceuticals overall were: Atenolol, a beta-blocker used to treat cardiovascular disease Meprobamate, a tranquilizer used in psychiatric treatment Atrazine, an organic herbicide banned in the European Union which has been implicated in the decline of fish stocks and in changes in animal behavior Naproxen, a painkiller and anti-inflammatory linked to increases in asthma incidence Carbamazepine, a mood-stabilizing drug used to treat bipolar disorder Phenytoin, an anticonvulsant used to treat epilepsy Estrone, an estrogen hormone secreted by the ovaries and blamed for causing gender changes in fish Sulfamethoxazole, an antibiotic Gemfibrozil, an anti-cholesterol drug TCEP, a reducing agent used in molecular biology Water Quality Matters! Contamination surveys such as those by the US Geological Survey (USGS)5, 6 can help us realize just how intimately connected we are with our environment, and how everything we do (and don't do) impacts that environment and boomerangs right back at us... We literally live in a sea of chemicals these days, and it is certainly not doing your health any good. Trace amounts of more than 150 different human and veterinary medicines have been detected in environments. According to the USGS, 80 percent of the streams in the US, along with nearly 25 percent of the nation's groundwater is contaminated with a variety of pharmaceuticals. The drug industry, while admitting that pharmaceuticals are clearly contaminating water supplies, maintains that the levels are too low to cause any harm. Yet, it's known that drugs in waterways can harm fish and other aquatic species, and laboratory studies show human cells do not grow normally when exposed to even trace amounts of certain drugs. Other potential concerns include: Some people are now exposed to traces of multiple drugs at one time, in addition to other harmful metals and chemicals in their water. Subsequently, people may be exposed to combinations of drugs that should not be combined Many drugs in the water supply are known to have dangerous side effects when taken in normal prescription doses Drugs that were only intended for external application will now be ingested and vice versa Some individuals are allergic to drugs found in the water supply Pregnant women are also being exposed to drugs that could potentially harm an unborn child Besides the health risk to humans, drug-tainted water also has an ecological impact, contributing to mass bird die-offs and promoting antibiotic-resistant pathogens. A previous article in Environment3607 describes just how devastating pharmaceutical contamination of the environment can be: ""The popular anti-inflammatory and arthritis drug, diclofenac... is used in both human and veterinary medicine. In India, farmers started dosing their cows and oxen with the drug in the early 1990s to relieve inflammation that could impair the animals' ability to provide milk or pull plows. Soon, about 10 percent of India's livestock harbored some 300 micrograms of diclofenac in their livers. When they died, their carcasses were sent to special dumps and picked clean by flocks of vultures. It was an efficient system, for unlike feral dogs and plague-infested rats, South Asia's abundant vulture population – estimated at more than 60 million in the early 1990s – carried no human pathogens and was resistant to livestock diseases such as anthrax. But vultures who fed on the treated carcasses accrued a dose of diclofenac of around 100 micrograms per kilogram. A person with arthritis would need 10 times that amount to feel an effect, but it was enough to devastate the vultures. Between 2000 and 2007, the South Asian vulture population declined by 40 percent every year; today [2010], 95 percent of India's Gyps vultures and 90 percent of Pakistan's are dead, due primarily to the diclofenac that scientists have found lurking in their tissues. South Asian and British scientists who experimentally exposed captive vultures to diclofenac-dosed buffalo found that the birds went into renal failure – scientists still don't know why – and died within days of exposure. As the vulture population has declined, the feral dog population has boomed, and the Indian government's attempt to control the rabies they carry has started to flounder."" Safer Ways to Dispose of Unused Drugs In response to what has become an obvious problem, some states have introduced ""take-back"" programs, which are, not surprisingly, being opposed by the drug industries. You can learn more about local efforts on takebacknetwork.com.8 To give you an idea of just how many drugs are discarded, the fourth DEA-led National Prescription Drug Take-Back initiative9, 10 held this past summer collected a staggering 276 tons of unwanted or expired medications! The four annual events have, in total, collected over 774 tons of drugs, which might otherwise have been flushed down the toilet or discarded into landfills, or been otherwise misused. The FDA released new guidelines last year for ""safely"" disposing of drugs:11 Follow any specific disposal instructions on the drug label or patient information that accompanies the medication. Do not flush prescription drugs down the toilet unless this information specifically instructs you to do so. [I would recommend never flushing ANY drug down the toilet, to protect your community's water quality] Take advantage of community drug take-back programs that allow the public to bring unused drugs to a central location for proper disposal. Call your city or county government's household trash and recycling service (see blue pages in phone book) to see if a take-back program is available in your community. The Drug Enforcement Administration, working with state and local law enforcement agencies, is sponsoring National Prescription Drug Take Back Days throughout the United States. If no instructions are given on the drug label and no take-back program is available in your area, throw the drugs in the household trash, but first: Take them out of their original containers and mix them with an undesirable substance, such as used coffee grounds or kitty litter. The medication will be less appealing to children and pets, and unrecognizable to peo­ple who may intentionally go through your trash. Put them in a sealable bag, empty can, or other container to prevent the medication from leaking or breaking out of a garbage bag. Remove and destroy any prescription labels before throwing away the containers. In some states, pharmacies can take back medications. When in doubt, you should ask your pharmacist for advice. Most are very well trained and educated professionals who will be glad to assist you in this area Of course, some of these suggestions merely move the environmental peril from one place to another – such as diluting medicines in water and mixing them in garbage that eventually ends up in a landfill near you anyway. The best way to reduce environmental drug pollution is also the simplest and most obvious – Take Control of Your Health by cutting down the number of drugs you take in the first place. Of course, to curb the pollution problem drug use will also have to be greatly reduced among livestock and other animals in our food supply, so do your part by supporting organic agriculture, in which animals are not permitted to be treated with antibiotics and other drugs. Also remember when you are drinking tap water you are consuming drugs that your community has been using in addition to chlorine and fluoride and disinfection by products. This is a very powerful reason to avoid drinking tap water unless it is filtered. "

What to do in the meantime?","It started on Thursday, when I took a nap and woke up with a mild, general tooth pain in a lateral incisor, and had slightly affected my central incisor. I thought I had been grinding my teeth in my sleep, as I often do, so I swished around warm salt water, took a Tylenol, and called it a day.  Friday, it was more prominent but not painful or obstructive. I did notice a numbness in my upper lip, and it was a tad swollen.I went out and bought Sensodyne for my tooth pain, thinking that it was just sensitive from grinding it in my sleep the previous day. It didn't start to get my attention until 6 in the evening, after my dentist's hours had closed. I took more Tylenol, applied some Orajel, and called it a day.  Saturday morning, I wake up early (5:30am) and my entire left cheek is swollen. I did some search on the internet, and I'm pretty sure it's an infection due to an abscessed tooth. I called my dentist, and with no surprise, they are closed, as it's Labor Day weekend. I found out I can't get an appointment until TUESDAY.  In the meantime, I am placing warm salt water in the area of my incisors every hour, switching between two ice packs every 15 minutes, eating soft foods, and taking amoxicillin. I had just taken my second dose of it today, and plan to take my last one for the day in about 8 hours. I am hoping that the amoxicillin and warm salt water will help with keeping the infection under control. I hope I am doing enough until Tuesday.  With that said, I need your help. Is there anything else I can do in the meantime? I'm thinking more, over-the-counter things, as I feel already feel like a liability, being a dependent on my parents, so urgent care isn't a priority to me unless it's absolutely necessary.

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/butrans-isnt-working-401738.html,Butrans isn't working ... ?,"I was put on Butrans for 3 different chronic pain conditions. I had some struggles with other narcotic pain medications, mostly because I need around the clock treatment. I tried Suboxone from a friend. Suboxone is a mixture of buprenorphine and naloxone, (buprenorphine being the narcotic in the Butrans patch), and was amazed at the relief and energy I had. (I have fibromyalgia and am tired ALL the time). So I went to my doctor and told him the truth, that I had tried the Suboxone and he prescribed me the patch, even though he really didn't even have the license for it. (Great doctor! although at this point, not much more he can do) So anyway, my question is... I've tried the 5's, felt nothing. He moved me up to the 10's, and still no results. After adding another 5mcg patch to the 10mcg patch (to make 15mcg per hour) with still no results, I have now had the 20 mcg patch on for 1 week and I have still not felt an ounce of pain relief. Has anyone ever heard of this or experienced it? I mean, is there something wrong with me or does this patch just not work on some people? I love my PCP and am SO thankful that he put his job on the line for me (if that's the case), but I am terrified to go to any more pain management specialists. I always feel like I have no say in my treatments, and like they are pushing things on me! Especially epidural injections for my spine, but I just can't handle them because of my fibro. I'm losing hope, because Suboxone is for addiction, and I think it's very rare if anyone at all subscribes it for pain. But it WORKS for me. There's also Subutex, without the Naloxone (which is what basically makes Suboxone for addiction and/or withdrawal), but I would obviously have to see a special doctor who can prescribe that. (And I have tried the Subutex as well, which works just as good as Suboxone). So, my question just turned into a large story, but as you all know who are in pain, it's a terrible struggle from day to day. And of course the people you love just want to help, but they also really don't want to hear about it anymore and that I can understand! I just wish I could find a great pain management doctor who treated me like my PCP does, but I honestly don't even feel like trying anymore since it seems it'll be an imminent letdown... well anyway, thanks to any readers... if you have an answer to my question, please let me know about the patch and if it's common for it to not work at all. Because even with the Suboxone, I could cut that into 3 pieces and eat 1 piece for a whole 24 hours which would completely eliminate my pain, so that was about 2.5 mg a day, and this patch I am wearing right now is supposed to be dispensing almost 3 mg a day. Whaaat the heck? :) "

The combination of the two pills makes him where he's falling asleep randomly through out the day. Everytime he tries to stop or take less of the pain pills he is in excruciating pain. If he doesn't take the Xanax he has panic attacks & thinks he's dying!! Its like a never ending thing. He is about to undergo a back surgery, so I am scared he's gonna take even more of them from the pain of surgery. I am terrified I'm gonna lose my husband. I barely sleep at night, I'm constantly feeling his heart to make sure its still beating or feeling for his breath. He isn't the typical addict. He wants to stop taking the pain meds, but he doesn't know how to stop without his body being in excruciating pain. I'm so worried and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm scared it's just a matter of time before he overdoses, or worse... Any professionals that could give me some advise would be greatly appreciated!! "

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/severe-leg-pains-legs-right-hip-back-shoulder-521315.html,"Severe leg pains in both legs, right hip, back and shoulder. could it all be related?","april will make 2 years that i've been suffering and just miserable. this has basically ruined my life. after my 3rd child was born i had my tubes tied just hours after delivery. i had a normal vaginal delivery with epidural. everything went as planned just like my first 2 children. about 2 weeks after being home i started to have unusual pains in both legs. about 5 to 6 years ago i was diagnosed with deg. disc disease, some pinch nerves, arthritis and bulging disc but it was never bad enough where i was back and forth to the doctors. i went to my obgyn 2 weeks after delivery and she tested for blood clots. everything was fine, no clots. i waited another 2 or 3 weeks and the pain didn't ease up so i went to my PCP and began testing. over the past 2 years i've had 3 MRI's,(1 on my neck 2 on my back) done 3 nerve test(the ones where they shock you) had 3 of the needle test where they stick you then shock the muscle, a scan on my head which showed i had 2 small strokes in the past, several x-rays and i cant remember all the other test. after the 3rd MRI about 1 year later a tear near L4 and L5 was found. either im pushed off to another doctor, they give me a ton of prescriptions to try and send me on my way or they blame it on the crap that was discovered years ago. i had one doctor that said i needed surgery. she was going to fuse the disc, brace the front and back of my spine and put an artifical bone in the tear. well i started to do a little research on her before i let her cut me open and was not happy with what i found so i went for a 2nd opinion. i was told it would help my back pain but i would come out still with the leg pains so i decided not do it. why put myself through that if it wasn;t gonna help the most painful parts. as the time passes im getting worse and worse. the pain started in both legs, then my lower back, then to my right hip. both legs have the exact same pain, its a deep dull, aching pain that is from hips to toes. around my thighs, front and back of my knees, my calves feel sore and all around my ankles and they feel like their always cold. they turn spotty blue and purple, my feet swell just a little from time to time but my right hip has been swollen since day one. every month that passes the pain is getting worse and worse and its traveling. about 3 to 4 months ago the pain started going up my back and into my right shoulder blade. nothing relieves the pain and theres nothing i can do or change that even helps it a little. i can lay in the bed all day or walk for hours straight and it still feels the same. but sitting all day or having my legs bent even for 10 minutes at a time is the worst. im having a hard time sitting at my desk for 8 hours a day now. i've been trying to do my own research now because im not getting anywhere with any doctors around here and sometimes when i do find something new i ask them to test for or even just inquire about, they just blow me off or tell me they dont think thats it without even testing for it. thats how i found out about the 2 strokes i had. i had them check me for MS, i was willing to test for everything and anything just to find the root of this pain so we could figure out how to stop it. im having other small issues going on and think it's caused from your basic common illnesses but on the other hand i cant help but to think maybe its related. like waking up in the middle of the night at least once a week because one of my hands went numb, but i push it off as carpel tunnel. or my eyes will bother me and i push it off as looking at the computer all day. just small things like that and none of the 15 doctors i've been to think anything of it is related. im so tired of living in pain. my life has been almost ruined by this and i can't do anything i use to enjoy doing. sometimes the pain is so bad it messes with me mentally. i can't even tolerate the sound of someones voice. i feel the doctors are not taking me serious or by time they figure out whats wrong, it will be too late and i'll be fully disabled my then. my last visit to a speicalist said i needed to see a rheumatologist. i called in november to make an appointment and the soonest they had was march 21st so im just stuck waiting it out. i have spent thousands of dollars on specailists and test and medicines that dont work because our health ins. now sucks and we have a very large deductiable. i miss work because some days are unbareable and my husband has to take off too because i can't take care of my kids on those bad days. im to the point now i only see my PCP for my pain meds and i only take one thing now. why put all those meds in my body that cause other problems or the side affects are just as bad as the pain. im sorry for the novel of a post but im sick and tired of hurting and dealing with doctors that only want your money. im only 31 years old and i feel like i've been though more than what some of my grandparents have. if anyone out here has experienced what im going through or knows someone who has and can shed some light for me, even if anyone has a suggestion of something i can ask to be tested for.

Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, my stomach has resumed making the noises it has before, at different timings. So my question is, is that still the sperm in my stomach? And since I haven't really gotten any side effects is that bad aswell? My period is usually at the end of the month, so around the starting dates of 27, 28 and 29. "

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/veteran-chronic-pain-cut-propaganda-537368.html,"As a veteran with chronic pain, will I be cut off because of propaganda?","Hi everyone. Today is my first day on this site. I am scared to death because I was injured in an... airborne accident in 2007 and have been through 3 cortizone shots and 3 nerve blocks before my pain doctor released me. I went to my regular doctor and she put me on Vicodan for a few months. It helped a little but I was still waking up at night with pain and exhausted. She switched me to 10/325 oxycodone/acetaminaphen as well as zanaflex and I have been doing very well ever since. Last week I went in to get my meds refilled and she said she had read a magazine article that said vets with PTSD are at high risk for addiction. The WHO has now classified dependence, tolerance and addiction as all the same thing. I just got to where I am living life well. The Oxycodone does not make me drowsy or nauseous like the Vicodin did. My doc has referred me to a pain specialist. My appointment is tomorrow and I'm scared to death they won't help me. My boyfriend is a medical student and both his parents are doctors and they said I won't get my medicine because it's a schedule II narcotic and the DEA is arresting doctors for drug trafficking! PLUS there is a new study that came out this month about vets being given too many opioids. I have MRIs and legitimate issues but I just moved in with my parents in a new state/town because my dad is dying from cancer. They own a dog breeding business I am now responsible for. It is a lot of physical work and I am TERRIFIED. I hope I can hold it together for the first impression. Anyone have any suggestions on how to behave so they will continue my therapy as is without accusing me of being a ""drug-addled, homeless baby-killer""? "

I told my Oncologist, with no answer in site so turning to people in this position as I am. Maybe not Cancer but Chronic Pain and not a Cure for my Cancer, so Chemo and pain relief all I have. Chemo is working to hold Cancer from spreading, but OxyContin not working like it use to. I am Blessed to have already have 2yrs and was dealing with this, but with this constant pain, is this the way I will have to live? I am very Religious and have prayed a lot along with the tears and stress, what else is there for me? Thank you in advance for any and all concern and any suggestions to talk with my Oncologist? "

I was honest with the Doctor when she came in, she said that the DEA would put it in they're database (computer). I got a call today 2 weeks later --- to come in to to talk about my results. Im so afraid that she will drop me as a patient! I am a very sick person and dont know what I would do. Does anyone know if they just drop you or give you a chance to stop. Thanks... "

Around 8 months ago I started having occasional back pain and told my doctor about it. I asked if it was from the Suboxone and he told me it wasn't (although it is a side effect). 4 months ago I started having constant and severe back pain. They told me I was having muscle spasms and prescribed me muscle relaxers and told me to start physical therapy. A few weeks after my back pain started, I started having widespread pain into my legs, neck, shoulders, head, etc. I did physical therapy and chiropractic for two months with no impact on my back pain. They then did an MRI on my back and the results came back normal. They have also tested me for hep C, thyroid problems, a vitamin D deficiency and whatever else they can test for in the urine and blood and all the results were normal. I have seen several doctors and a couple have told me my symptoms are in agreement with the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. I also had a spine specialist tell me to get off the Suboxone because that could be causing the pain. I have greatly decreased my dose from 32mg on my worst days to 8 mg and am not feeling better yet, although I'm sure I am feeling a little withdrawal too. To me, it seems that if Suboxone were causing this pain, then the pain would have started when I started the Suboxone instead of 5 months into my treatment. So I ask you, could Suboxone be causing my pain? HELP PLEASE- I have lost my job and all semblance of a normal life because of the pain and I am only 24 yrs old... "

Im a mom 0f 3 awesome boys. We are very active. I have always been an athlete. Discovered 6 years ago, I had fibromyalgia. My doc gave me on 10mg lortab for pain. I have been on them since. Of course, like many of you, I was addicted and needed more. The cost ws crazy, but we do anything to keep going. I had a 20 per day habit, plus if lortabs were not available i would take percs. Got divorced after 15 years of marriage and its been a nightmare. We have been divorced 1 1/2 years and he wants to lower support, so he is going to court and requesting a drug screen. Before I knew about the drug screen, a friend said I should try subs to get off lortab. I would take my lortabs, then take subs til next refill. Did that 4-5 times, but decided on 8/17 this had to be the last, because he requested the screen and I have no script. At this point, i had took 120 10mg lortab in 6 days, then been on subs 8mg or 4mg foor 3weeks. I had no choice but to stop. It is 8/29 and the withdrawals are terrible. How long will they continue. I cant handle much more, but I want to do this for me and my boys. Enough is enough. I want the meds out of my life, but its hard. Im scared because if my drug test comes back positive, he gets 60/40 custody or 50/50, depends how bad. I cant let that happen. My boys and I are tight. They are under all 3 under 12, and they are what makes me happy. I have to pass this drug test for suboxone and hydrocodone or my boys go with an idiot who want to pay less money, but really dont want to see the kids. He dont see them on days he could now. This is torture. I never knew withdrawals could be so bad or last so long. So, does anyone no how much longer withdrawals will last if last dose was 8mg on 8/17, and how long before it will show negative on a urine sub drug screen. I have heard about the half-life, but could someone be more accurate, so I will have an idea when to go take the test. My boys need me, and they need me clean. Im a fighter. I will suffer this pain for us, but I dont know how strong I will be if the test is positive, and he gets my boys. Someone, please help me get the most accurate information. Im 5'1 and 115lbs. Dont know body fat %. My metabolism is average. Last dose of sub 8mg was 8/17 after taking it for 3-4 weeks. So, how long would that amount stay in you and when would you advise I go get the screen done, so it will be negative. I will suffer this, just to pass that test, and be clean once again. Please-anyone-Im desparate. This cant be a guess, it needs to be pretty close. My family depends on it, and I cant find the information on that anywhere. Only how long it stays in the system. I have to know how long til its out to pass the drug screen. Thanks for listening, and I pray someone has the answer. God Bless You All. Its a long hard road. Thanks Help!!! "

I also suffer from MRSA and have been going to the same urgent care clinics and emergency rooms for that as well, also leaving with pain scripts. One urgent care doctor told me that he wasn't going to give me any pain meds for my shoulder because he thought I was searching for drugs and not really in pain. He pulled some list and told me that I've gotten a lot of pain scripts over the past few months, which I have for real reasons. He referred me to an orthopedic doctor and I have been seeing him for several months. I haven't been to the urgent clinics or emergency rooms for the past several months for my back, shoulder, or MRSA but I have been there for flu, bronchitis, etc...

I am eating when I take the Savella so I don't risk the chance of getting nauseated, but am worried about the weight gain. Have been so tired and lazy feeling for years that it's been impossible to stick to any diet or exercise program. Does anyone have comments on the weight issues as well? If day 5 is any indication of the future, I can definitely see myself getting back into being more active and having a better quality of life! "

Two pain specialists I’ve been too so far have not been accepting, let’s just say that. First one, right off the bat when he walked in the room said “I will not be prescribing any pain medications to you, none, I will not take on any of your medications.” And this was a Pain Specialist at Rush Pain Center.  So the next doctor I saw basically said “she might” take over my hydrocodone, she put me on 6 tramadol's a day, but WOULD NOT prescribe me Soma and Nucynta. She said these words, “No, that’s a deal-breaker, I will not prescribe those two, that’s it we’re done talking about those two.” Basically, her only kind of treatment she was offering was soft tissue injections, which for me, have literally no effect; I’ve had them done many many times all throughout my back and neck with no relief whatsoever.  Nobody wants to be on any medication, but when you’ve tried all the alternatives to no prevail, what’s the answer? I want to have a life, I want to get my life back... yet no doctor seems to understand that and is unwilling to prescribe me my medications that actually help me function.  By the way,  I am 25 years old, I’ve been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Chronic Active Epstein Barr Virus.

I've been through just about every opiate including, but not limited to; morphine,methadone,percocet,lortab,hydrocodone,oxycodone,etc. When my pain spikes I end up in the ER on a regular basis, (an aggitating subject in itself since NO ONE knows what this disease is.) They end up giving me iv injections of valium and dilaudid. I take the vicodin on a regular basis through my dr. but have never received a script for dilaudid for pain. It IS the only med that provides break-through pain relief. I've talked to both my dr. and pain mgmt dr. about this but so far no scripts for the dilaudid. My pain mgmt dr prefers all scripts come from my RSD doc for the benefit of not crossing scripts. I am currently a med student and have no problem injecting myself if need be, although I do see dilaudid also comes in oral doses. Is any other RSD/CRPS patient taking this drug and if so how'd you get your dr. to prescribe? Does the dilaudid work for you? I'm really tired of being a guinea pig on higher doses of alternative meds that DO NOT work and having to live w/alot of side effects from something I'm not receiving a benefit from.

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/oxycodone-withdrawal-what-to-expect-and-does-314006.html,Oxycodone Withdrawal - What to Expect and Does Ativan Help?,"I broke my leg 7 years ago and I have been on and off low doses (5mg) for most of those years. I would take a few months off here and there with no withdrawal what so ever. However, 5 months ago, my orthopedic recommended me to Pain Management because I am only 25 years old and suffer from chronic knee pain due to the injuries I sustained. He told me this new doctor could prescribe me the oxycodone long term without the tylenol. I have been on (15mg) Doses since I switched to this new doctor 5 months ago. They are 15mg Roxicodone Pills that I take 6 times a day (90Mg a day spread out). Approximately 2 months ago, I found myself needing more and more and I increased my dose to 30Mg 3xDay then 30Mg 4xDay... for a total of 120Mg a day. I ran out early that month and I let my doctor know. He told me it was normal for my body to need more of the medicine to relieve my pain but that he would not prescribe any more than what he already is for my condition.  This left me in a terrible position and I felt like I needed more so I would have 3 weeks of relief and 1 week of withdrawal every month. I have been running out a week early every month for the past 3 months. However, I have supplemented other medication I have left over when the symptoms got too bad. Everytime I suffer what I would consider mild to severe withdrawal symptoms for a day or two I would take my left over medication (5mg) oxycodone doses to try to relieve these symptoms.  The problem I have right now is that I am on my last 15mg dose right now. My next appointment is not for 10 days. I do not have any left over medication to help supplement a smooth symptom free withdrawal. My question is this : How long and severe do you think the withdrawal symptoms will last? I have been on them for 5 Months straight taking a week off here and there. My DR. told me I shouldnt withdrawl because 15 mg is a low dose however it is not 15mg it is 120mg/day. How long and how severe do you think the withdrawal will be? I have read it can be anywhere from 2 Days to a Week. I have one other question. I am on Ativan for anxiety... I have read on several sites that Ativan is actually a great medication for the reduction of withdrawal symptoms. Is this true?  Well everyone wish me luck I am hoping that this is a blessing in disguise and that in 10-Days my tolerance will be reduced and I can start taking the medication at a much lower dose. Let me know what everyone thinks. I am nervous about the withdrawal and whether or not I am going to be able to get thru this without professional help. I mean at the same time it is only 10-Days.  Thanks for the help everyone :) "

Primarily near my left ovary. I figured it was a cyst and didnt plan to go to the doctor.( Im on the depo shot and have been experiencing some heavy bleeding and periods that were lasting around 2 weeks.)  Three months later the pain has worsened and i decided to go see my OBGYN.. who wasnt very interested in my cyst & as always blamed the bleeding on the depo shot. She told me if its still hurting after a month or two to come back for an ultra sound. Two months later my pain has continued to get worse along with the painful bleeding. So I went for the Ultra Sound and some sort of vaginal camera thing.  Today i get a phone call from my doctor telling me i have Pelvic Inflammatory Disease. I spent hours researching it & it is just NOT possible for an STD at this time. I still have a golf ball sized pain feeling like its right on top of my ovary area that has been continuous since the beginning. Which my dr did not even mention seeing a cyst in the ultra sound. I have so many questions and am so confused. I noticed some cases of PID the infection was caused by bacteria. I am wondering if the cyst burst and caused bacteria .. ending up causing PID.? If not then where did the cyst go? The pain i continue to feel is primarily on my left ovary.  Just hoping to find a second opinion about this or some advice from some one! :) thank you 
Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/can-someone-to-be-marked-as-a-pill-seeker-on-309329.html,"Can someone be marked as a pill seeker on their medical records? If so, how can it be removed?","My wife was recently diagnosed with TMJ after 6 months of trial and error by several doctors and dentists. Her main dentist has been prescribing her pain medicine for most of the 6 months. After he did everything he could for her teeth including 3 root canals, an extraction and a bone graft, he referred her to an oral surgeon who removed 4 impacted wisdom teeth.  We got medicine from this Doc in a small shady cash pharmacy since we were 3 hours away from home. She was still having pain and now her dentist thinks she is after pills and was lying about pain since he can't seem to fix her. We found a GOOD physician who was an ENT and recognized her symptoms to be TMJ just by cracking her jaw with his hand. So we are on the 3 doctor and he gives her a script which we filled at a 24 hour pharmacy because our regular was closed and tells her to see a dentist again... After all these doctors including the handful of trips to the ER afterhours because of pain and scripts at different pharmacies I am worried she has been labeled or marked as a pill seeker. She is in no way a drug abuser and always takes the medicine as directed. We are talking about someone who went through 3 child births with no epiderals, spinals and took 600mg motrin after she was sliced from hip to hip...  It seems like the more she went to different doctors and pharmacies ""which was out of our control"" the more doctors have been avoiding giving her narcotics. They used to give it out like candy and now they give everything but... If she has been flagged, is there anyway to remove it? It's making things much harder for our personal lives and our business. She had to go through the withdrawl symptoms once already and detoxed on her own, it was a nightmare and took weeks after her first dentist just cut her off cold turkey after she had been taking 7.5 hydrocodone everyday for the last 6 months. She wouldn't be taking this stuff if she wasn't in so much pain, she is always worried about taking more than the maximum daily dose and has never taken more than directed. How do I get rid of this history or flags and make these doctors realize she is not pill seeker? She is just looking for a solution that apparently 8 years of med school isn't enough to solve in this day in age.. "

I take oxycontin and oxyIR for pain management with real hope of being free from intolerable back pain, and I take as little as possible but can hardly walk as drugs wear off or I've been sitting a while.I've tried lots of drugs but have been able to stay on this regime without increasing the dose while tolerating the pain, so I maybe should just shut up and be happy I'm somewhat ambulatory. I feel like an old cripple most of the time, an embarrassment to my family, and dream of the days when I could remember things, stay awake through a movie, not be constipated, be able to run and sit on the floor like a normal person, etc. Does this suboxone alleviate pain also?  On a side note... I hear talk about highs and lows from meds, but I don't feel any of that, just pain relief, although I.m sure if little green men appeared in my bedroom and cured my back, I would have to wean off the pills since I must be physically addicted after years of taking meds. I asked my dr why so many people want the meds for getting high and I don't feel high, and he said it has to do with a reduction of pain reducing chemicals the body produces naturally but can't keep up when you are in pain continuously. So is this suboxone something I would want? I guess what I really want to say is does it take care of pain and also let ;you feel like your old self ? I'm sorry I'm so dense. I do appreciate answers.

The hydrocodone ratio is the same altho the tylenol is a bit higher but isn't a problem because the dentist said I can take a tylenol with the script and it equates right (so I wont be over doing the tylenol). My question is due to my employer doing a good bit of randoms at that moment I don't want to be messed up by taking something that won't metabolize the same way. I have always been told that hydrocodone is hydrocodone and all the fancy names (lortab, vicodin, norco, etc) are the brand names but it is all the same with different tylenol amounts.

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/tramadol-ruining-life-541815.html,Tramadol is ruining my life!?,"I have been on Tramadol for about a year now. I was originally prescribed this evil drug for chronic pelvic pain. Since I was addicted to Vicodin for several years, this seemed like the perfect drug! Non Narcotic (so they say), non addictive (pshhh!), until I realized that if I took a few extra I could get high from it, and it wasnt like Vicodin, it was an ALL day high. But as an addict, my mind got the best of me and I convinced myself that since it was non-narcotic, I couldnt get addicted. Boy was I wrong!! I am a full blown addict now, Ive had 3 seizures, and take about 10 a day (50mg), this is good because I was at about 20/day. I detoxed myself once and it was the WORST possible thing I have ever possibly went through.  6 weeks ago I was involved in a major car accident causing about 6 of my vertebra to squish together, so as any addict would, I used this as an excuse to take more and get back on the Vicodin.  I AM DONE!!! I want out! My desire to be sober is stronger than my desire to use. I cannot rememeber a time when I had ""natural energy"". I am a mother, a business owner, college educated with a beautiful home... and I accomplished that all high. I suppose Im afraid that I wont know how to function sober. I have devised a plan this week and next to taper off and then just let myself detox so I can say goodbye to this Devil for good.  My plan is to only take as little as possible this week for me to not be incredibly uncomfortable, but I work as a bartender on the weekends, so this weekend I will take the last of my Vicodins to get through my shift. I have 6 days to slowly detox, then 2 days of work, then after the weekend I am going to strait detox. By next weekend I should be well enough to work without any meds. I think I should re-fill my anti-anxiety meds and take them if the detox gets too aweful (you know! the no sleep, restlessness, ect.) I started taking St. Johns Wart as I heard it will help.  Any advice will help. Im kind of desperate here :( "

I've been having unprotected sex with my boyfriend for the past 4 months, and every time he's came inside. I would take this pill called Postinor Unidosis after we had unprotected sex. Ok so here's the confusing part... After I took the pill, me and my bf would continue to have unprotected sex and he would always cum inside. I would not take more pills. I only took one pill and had unprotected sex until the pill ""flushed"" everything out.. I guess it had been working bc I haven't gotten pregnant. BUT NOW here's my concern! Me and my bf had sex the day I got off my period which was Jan 6. I didn't take the pill until 4-5 days later. Keep in mind it's not Plan B and I've heard you have to take this pill within the 72hrs. Anyways, I thought the pill would still work, like every other time, so we did our thing and had sex while I was ovulating. I didn't know I was ovulating. Then again on Sunday, Jan. 18th was the last time we had sex. Of course he came in me. I know it's not healthy at all and these pills are not suppose to be taken every other week. Exactly why I would just take one and be good until I got my next period. But my thing is I think I might be pregnant now. I still haven't missed my period but I'm going to check in a couple of days. I don't understand how this method had been working bc I know the pill doesn't stay in your system for long, but apparently everytime I did it it worked. But like I said I think I might be pregnant bc after I took the pill I had sex like 5 days later on my ovulation day and he came inside and I didn't take the pill after that or after this past time on Sunday which he also came inside.

I don't know if they still prescribe for chronic pain though. I did have a shot of it while in labor, 48 hour labor!!! I remember it relaxing me between contractions but still feeling some pain. "

Does anyone else get these?","And if anyone does, what do you do for them? Let me try and explain. It feels like the bones in my feet are being twisted and contorted out of position. And when it's really bad I can see my toes trying to arch upwards, rather than downwards. I guess it's coming from muscle spasms in the feet and legs. The pain is immense. Sometimes the pain goes upward into my calf leg muscles. If I don't wake up and jump out of bed fast enough I can't move because the pain is so strong. Last night it's a good thing I didn't have the covers over my body because I would have never got out of bed fast enough. I've told 3 docs about this and they don't have a name for it. I took 10 mg Flexeril for a few years but it didn't always work. Last Winter a new doc had me try Baclofen for a while and it did work for a while. But then I was taking 30 mg of Baclofen before bed and I was sleep walking and falling in my sleep. Now I'm back on Flexeril. Last night I jumped out of bed after 2 hours screaming. I walked it off and took another 15 mg of Flexeril. I'm only supposed to take 10 mg at a time. But 3 hours later I got the pains in my left foot again and I got up. Kinda way too early, but I fear sleeping due to these pains.  I was thinking of asking the doc for Zanaflex, but I was just reading Lara's question from yesterday and some of you think Zanaflex is weaker than Flexeril? That's not what I was hoping to hear. Anyone have any ideas?  One more thing. I think too much of 1 of my meds caused a seizure last week. I think I took too much Flexeril 1 night because in the morning the bottle was opened and pills were scattered about. Can too much Flexeril cause a seizure?  Sorry this is so many questions in one thread. "

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/drug-testing-for-pain-management-495832.html,Drug Testing For Pain Management?,"If anyone has an answer or any insight into this very perplexing problem, it would be appreciated. I am a 63 year old man that has been diagnosed with degenerative spinal disease. My Neurologist and Pain Management physicians as well as my General Practitioner all agree that there is no procedure that will help me. In short, it is what it is and I have to live with it. The only solution is pain medication that will help dull the pain to the point that I can have a semblance of normalcy in daily life. I have been on the following regiment for the past four years, Fentanyl Transdermal Patch, 25 mcg, once every 72 hours and Percocet 10/325 every six hours. During that period of time I have had many urine tests at my General Practitioners and Pain Management physician’s office and there was never a problem. This changed with my last visit to my Pain Management doctor. My urine test did not indicate the present of Percocet which naturally set off a red flag. The urine sample was then sent to an outside laboratory which came back and did not indicate Percocet and it also did not indicate the presents of Fentanyl. Naturally my Pain Management doctor was quite concerned due to the abuse that is rampant with prescription pain medication. I have never had a problem with drugs or alcohol and I am very careful with the pain medication that I take. My pain medication is kept in a locked safe and no one has access to the medication but me. I have never given my medication to anyone and I have never sold my medication, nor has the thought ever crossed my mind. My medication was tested and it tested positive for Oxycodone, so it was apparent that I was taking the drug Oxycodone. I have always been very consistent with applying the Fentanyl Patch every 72 hours, while there are times when I will go over a couple of hours in taking the Percocet, however never more than three hours. I use both prescriptions completely each month and have from the start of the regiment.  Thankfully, my Pain Management physician knows me well enough to know that the chance of me not taking my complete prescriptions each month and or selling my prescriptions is not in my nature. He also knows that I am intelligent enough to know that I am going to have a drug test when I come to his office. The only rational logic is that for both the test and the retest, both of which were negative, the time from the ingestion of the drug until the time of the test was between 7-8 hours. I did another control test where I was tested two hours after ingestion and the test was positive. This however, does not explain the fact that the outside lab test showed negative for Fentanyl. Any Ideas, ANYONE? "

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/norco-10-325-sudden-weak-started-11-3-2014-iv-3-2313161.html,Why are norco 10/325 all of the sudden so weak? This started on 11/3/2014 iv tried 3 different pills,"First I would like to apologize for my bad spelling and grammar I'm sorry if it bothers you I didn't have the best schooling growing up and on top didn't know at the time how important it was to actually pay attention,  Ok so I have been taking hydrocodon-acetaminophen 10/325 for close to a year now and have had no complaints about it. Iv gone to 7.5/325 for a month or two and then to 5/325 for a month or two before going back to 10/325 because the pain was increasing, iv been back on the 10/325 for around 4 months now and everything has been ok, but as of 11/03/2014 I went to my normal pharmacy and got my normal prescription and got my normal pills that I take at the exact same time every day since my accident and procedure, this time they were a lot less helpful, I weigh around 240lbs so to start with they take a little longer to start working, but because I hadn't taken anything that day and the day before I was in a lot of pain and wanted the pain to go away as fast as possible and go away as much as possible so I took 2 pills both were cut in half like I normally do so they work a little faster, normally they start working in about 20-40 mins and my pain almost goes completely away in about an hour and some change when taking 1 pill split in half, this time I doubled my dose and split them in half, when an hour had gone by and the pain was still there pretty strong I took another thinking that maybe I had eaten to much that day and my food was absorbing the pills and not allowing my body to take the Medicean like normal, my pain finely started to go away enough for me to be slightly comfortable but nothing like normal, when I started taking the pills about a year ago I would get a little high and feel light on my feet when I was on my feet that is, but I no longer get that feeling as expected when taking them as long as I have, I'm not taking them to get high like most people do or like most doctors think, I have a lot of pain and problems that people my age (20) should not have, I had a discectomy because of multiple motorcycle an bmx bike crashes and all the other things that kids do when there my age and younger, I had my disc rupture and push on my nurves, to the point that my legs tingled 24-7 like they had fallen asleep and my knees were so week that some times I would fall not knowing that I was falling until I hit the ground, after having the discectomy everything was about 90% back to normal and things were looking up, about 3-4 months after surgery things started to go down hill an got worse over the course of 4 months, I have recently come to find out that I now have 2 hurnoated discs that are both pushing on my nurves again and causing the same problumes as before, so now that you understand my pain and my reasons for my pain il get back to what happen, I took the 3pills and finely got a little relief, but nothing like my normal pills and I have no idea why! When I took these pills it was like I was taking the lowest dosage that they can prescribe which I believe is 5/325 and they suck! I might as well be taking straight tylonal, The only thing that makes any since to me is that the FDA has done something to change something along the way, I do know that as of November 1st 2014 the FDA has moved almost all narcotics up a class in there drug schedule classes, now understanding this and how hard it makes it for me and anyone to got our regular prescriptions with out being questioned by the pharmacist until allowing us to get our stuff, this was only saposed to make the pills be a higher class, not make them weaker so why does it seem this way, what is going on? What do I do? I'm in pain all of the time now! I have a hard time sleeping because the pain is so strong and my legs do nothing but buzz all night, I have told my doc but they said there isn't much thay can do, I don't want to ask for anything stronger because I like how these use to work and I also don't want it to look bad when I say I need something stronger! But at this point I don't think I have a choice, or do I? Any help would be greatly appreciated, how do I bring this up with my doc with out looking stupid or crazy? And what is the reason for this?  Thanks! Ps Steven  Just for the record I'm taking gabapantin as well every day to help with the buzzing in my legs, could this have anything to do with why the norco seams weaker? I have been taking it with the norco for around two months and have had no issues like this while taking them both,  Again thank you for your help "

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/pain-shoulder-arm-feel-hit-funny-bone-3049782.html,I have pain in my shoulder/ arm that feel like I hit my funny bone?,"Hi! I need help. I have had extremely bad pain in my shoulder/arm for about 7 months now. It is aggravated by exercise, but it doesn't actually hurt during the exercise. I have just noticed that the day after exercise (which involves simple stuff like running for as little as 15 minutes and doing some ab exercises) the pain starts to flare up. The pain always starts in my left shoulder. It seems to be coming from the supraspinatus area (just guessing based of of diagram of the body I've looked up). It then continuously gets worse and travels down my left arm into my elbow (which hurts very badly) and my pinky and ring and middle finger. The pain switches off between throbbing and a tingly aching (similar to hitting my funny bone but it's in my shoulder too). So far, I've seen a neurologist, a neurosurgeon, and a physical therapist. I had MRI's done on my brain and neck. My brain was clean and I had a slight bulging disk in my neck in the C4-C5 region (somewhere around there)? The neurosurgeon thought my disk wasn't bulging enough to cause much pain and it also only made sense that it would cause pain in my shoulder and not arm. He prescribed physical therapy for 6 weeks which seemed to help but once that finished and I started exercising again, the pain flared back up to how it had been at the beginning. Once the pain comes, it stays for 1-2 weeks. Ice seems to help numb it, but only temporarily. I've spent so much money on medical costs for them to tell me they don't know what's wrong. Before I see anyone else, I want to know if anyone's had this problem/ know's what it is or who I should see. I can't afford to keep going to doctors for them to tell me they don't know. The pain interferes greatly with my sleep and my school work. It's obviously stopped me from doing physical activity for the most part. No pain reliever reduces the pain (naproxen sodium, ibuprofen, etc). I also got an epidural injection in my neck in the area where the disk was bulging which didn't seem to help at all. Just some background information that might be useful: I used to cheer in middle and high school during which I was very active and had no problems. I have a history of migraines. The pain also seems to be correlated with stress. I am 20 years old, soon to be 21. Also, I'm left handed. "

She didn't say anything further, but now I am being put in with the nurse practitioner and she will not reschedule me for my next medication appt. until I see their addiction specialist, who does not take insurance and costs $135. Anyway, I am supposed to go see him tomorrow and I forgot all about it and went to a wine tasting on Friday night. I know these alcohol metabolite tests can go back 80 hours so about 4 days. I have been taking Milk Thistle & Niacin, but don't know if that is enough. Should I try to reschedule my appointment to later in the week. I do not over drink or drink right after taking my pain meds, so I am very responsible about it. I wait 4-6 hours after last dose to drink. I would welcome any advice please? I don't want to get kicked out of this pain group. They have been really good to me until this. Thanks! "

Sometimes I would have bad bouts of severe constipation. My abdominal pain is always present, sometimes worse than others. I was hospitalized a year ago for a week. Couldn't keep any food down and was severely constipated with lots of pain. I haven't felt good since then. The GI doctor put me on an elimination diet which I did for 8 weeks. I also had breath tests done. After, those, the doctor put me on a no gluten, fructose and lactose diet (which sucks). I maybe felt a little better (I have been on that for a month now). I also was diagnosed with SIBO and just finished a 10 day treatment of Rifaximin. I felt really good while taking the antibiotic. And continued to feel good for about a week and now I am very constipated and my stomach hurts. Is this constipation normal after taking the Rifaximin. I am taking probiotics twice daily so, do I need to be patient and give my digestive tract time to get back to normal. I have had many major abdominal surgeries, one was after a car accident. I had to have my spleen removed and I have lots of adhesions. I have a narrowing due to adhesions where the stomach empties into the intestines. The doctors don't want to do anything with it at this time. I am looking for answers. Any input on the current constipation and diet would be a huge help! I also take quite a large dose of Prilosec.

I'd like to start off first I'm 21 years old father with a gorgeous year old daughter and weigh roughly 145 and have been about that for the past few years. I've always done labor work for work, construction, roofing, etc. I started having chronic lower back pain about 2 years ago, went to my primary doctor (whose no longer mine) about it and he told me it was stress related and prescribed me 120 .5 xanax 4 times a day. They did help with my anxiety but did nothing for the back pain. we then tried every non norco pain killer, tramdols too which did nothing. About a month ago I went to the Orthopedic doctor myself and told him about the pain and we did an x-ray, I had read that x-rays don't show much about the spine unless you have some type of bone spur or fracture, he told me my spine looked decent, slight scoliosis. I then asked him to do an MRI he said it would be a waste being so young, but he agreed to do it. Two days later I received a call saying that they found 3 herniated discs which one is pushing into my thecal sac(was told that was my spinal column?), diagnosed me with degenerative disc decease. Theres more, but I can't find my mri results right now, something about narrowing where the nerves break off down into the legs? stenosis? My Pain management doctor I finally was able to see would like to try cortisone shots and I'm completely up for them, but he wont seem to prescribe me any type of norco which i can understand being so young, but I am in constant pain and I'm just not the type of person who likes giving into it, i have a high pain tolerance and i just keep moving. the past three months though have been the worst. horrible flares at times, my daughter just starting walking so i think it has much to do with that, oh by the way i was told not to lift more then 20 pounds, Lucy, my goober weighs 25, and there is no way I'm not holding my baby, anyways sorry to get off topic but pretty much I'm writing this because i just don't know what to do. when the flare comes I go to the er and they'll prescribe me a few days worth of either hydrocodone or oxycodone they work, but I feel like in only just a few days i fell dependent on them already because they actually take the pain away and i can function. I would just like any ones feed back really, please keep it positive. thank you, Goober92010 aka John "

I have been okay for about four years on that issue, but have intermittent issues with my neck vertibre when under a lot of stress and long hours.

Long story short, I am taking no medication for this except Aleve. I was told they might be able to give me a steroid shot or possibly a short term perscription for Flexiril (sp?) which has worked in the past to stop the spiral of muscle spasms caused by the irratated pinched nerves.

PLEASE HELP???,"After taking this medicine for the 10 days like my doctor prescribed me to take, which has almost been a year ago. I wasn't experiencing anymore pain in my right ear so I figured the medicine has cured what problems I was experiencing at that time until just yesterday after waking up I had the most sharpest, stabbing severe pain in my ear again, where I couldn't even bare to lift my head from my pillow cause it felt like the pain was shooting even deeper into the inside of my ear which I had been laying on my right side which was probably putting alot of pressure on my ear but the inside of my right ear hurt so severely that I almost cried, its a very intense sharp, stabbing, throbbing pain deep inside, probably close to the inside of my earlobe. My question is why am I having ear pain like this? I take very good care of myself. And atleast three times a week I clean my ears out with a quitip, sometimes adding rubbing alcohol to the qui -tip. And I know not to shove the qui-tip deep inside the ear, and I don't. I basically clean around the inside which i don't go too deep into and around the entire ear. I work in a very dusty environment with carbon, though I work in the office I don't get all the black stuff (Carbon) in my ears like the laborers, but daily I am always getting something out of my ears, even sometimes you can't see anything in them after cleaning them up. I have never experienced this much pain, not even a year ago when my dr prescribed this medication to me. I have had a few little minor pain issues in the same ear which I didnt pay too much attention to as I thought the pain was possibly a pimple, and I could feel it or something like a pimple in the inside of my ear, and the only thing I would end up doing was pushing the pimple towards myself with one of my fingers applying a little pressure, hoping it would eventually pop after applying a little pressure to the pimple daily until it was ready to leave my ear. lol. Sorry this is so long, but my husband and I just moved back to the OK area, and I haven't found a doctor just yet, which when I do find this doctor this time, I am going to ask for a referal to a specialist cause I never want to experience those pains again. lol. Heck I also have degenerative disc disease with two erupted disc, which one sits right on my spinal cord, as next week I am already going to a specialist in the city so in the meantime while waiting to get into the doctor I figured I would ask some other viewers, if they have ever experienced the pain I am experiencing, I really need some good advice on what I can possibly do, to help it, or to temporary ease the pain naturally until I can be seen by my doctor. I would greatly appreciate anyone's help in trying to help me. Thanks for your patience in reading this letter. I hope to find some good answers, I look forward to it. :) "

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/dear-all-has-the-fentanyl-duragesic-patch-caused-176955.html,Has the Fentanyl Duragesic Patch caused you concerning side effects?,"I currently take the 50 mcg Fentanyl Duragesic Patch. Honestly, I cannot stand this medication, but it does bring relief to my spine, which includes (please excuse spelling) spondiolythesis, severe degenerative disk disease, facet stenosis, mild scoliosis, bulging disks down the entire spine, and arthritis. I have had nerve burning procedures , but they only relieved 30% of the pain. Beyond the back pain, I naturally suffer from performance anxiety disorder(fear of public speaking), which is my only diagnosed mental condition before taking the drug. Since taking fentanyl, I have noticed an increase in generalized anxiety. I am not sure if it is because I cannot sleep as the medication peaks. But after the ""peak"" level, I find I am exhausted, agitated, and lately experience breakthrough pain. I am too frightened to go up in dose for fear of what it involves to adjust to the medication because all the side effects are doubled when moving up a dose at least for me. For instance, I will experience vomiting for around a month when I first take a higher dosage. I did take the 25 mcg for a year although I had breakthrough pain the entire time as well as the other side effects. But when I began having panic attacks for no reason at all, I did confide in my doctor. The answer was the breakthrough pain was causing the panic attacks. I then moved up to 50 mcg. And yes, it did/does control my pain like no other pain medication, but after several months the panic attacks returned as well as generalized anxiety that make me appear manic because I do feel like I am on some type of ""speed"" during what I will call the first phase of the medication as it peaks. One other issue that I have read on this site that happened to me as well as others was waking up during an endoscopy and colonoscopy(sp). I have read others have woken up during surgery.  I am only 40 years old, and I do not think I can live the rest of my life on this medication. I just do not feel like myself. My pain management doctor stated that it was either Fentanyl or a morphine pump since my back pain is inoperable. I do have issues with morphine because after two surgeries before fentanyl, I felt so horrible on morphine that I remember just waiting for medical personnel to take me off the morphine.  Also, I do not necessarily think I am opiate intolerant because I have had demerol for medical procedures and did not experience major side effects such as I have with morphine and fentanyl. Does anyone else share this experience? I also have taken vicoprofen and oxycodone. Unfortunately, oxycodone does not seem to help my pain. Vicoprofen does, and again I did experience a jittery feeling at first, but after using that medication after a month or two, the side effects disappeared although I experienced too much breakthrough pain, and I needed take it with another pain medication. At the time, I was living in a city when I finally found a fantastic pain management doctor. He too had a bad back and was determined to discover how my back got in its current state. We discovered I almost had spina bofida (sp) because I have a small opening(hole) at L5, which caused all the other problems. I apologize for rambling, but after reading the message boards on this site, you have helped me understand that I am not alone. This is the first time that I am posting because my husband and his family cannot make the connection for my need to make up for sleep after the second phase--the after peak effect, which is the fatigue I experience. On top of that, we recently moved closer to my husband's family, my sister-in-law and mother-in-law, both nurses, think I suffer from depression because of the fatigue. They both work in hospitals and think fentanyl is a wonderful medication. They both also suffer from depression. I try to communicate with them about what I am experiencing, but they tend to ignore me. My husband has recently observed how his sister treats me like I am a ""crazy"" person. She and her husband both ignore me when I communicate with them so I usually just try to keep conversation on a shallow level since I just found out some things that I will mention later. However, my friends and family that have known me my entire life know that I do not suffer from depression but performance anxiety, and they are shocked at this perception. Moreover, I am an advocate for therapy, and not once, have therapists recognized me as one suffering from depression but performance anxiety. My family history does not include depression but anxiety. Before taking fentanyl, I did visit a psychiatrist to pinpoint the PMA disorder, and I went through extensive cognitive behavioral theory that was a success. So the problem is that my husband's family thinks I am ""mental"" although my friends and family that now live far away are aware of the PMA and could attest that the side effects of fentanyl are causing this fatigue after peaking on fentanyl. Regardless, they too are upset that they cannot step in and help support me with this very vocal family. This vocal family likes to gossip, and since we now live in a small town, they are gossiping about me to others like my son's teacher or members of my church. They are not gossiping about my fentanyl use, but that they think I am ""mental."" Is anyone in a similar boat as myself in this regards? I am to the point that I would rather have my mind back and deal with severe back pain because there is one more important factor. I am two chapters away from completing my dissertation, but since beginning the fentanyl, I just do not have the stamina to complete it. I really want to complete my dissertation because I do think it is my calling to teach in higher ed, which I currently do. I especially like teaching online because the flexibility works around my medication dilemma although when teaching onsite, I do have a knowledge base that does not interfere with my interaction with students; however, I am concerned if I remain on fentanyl, I will not have the stamina to become a full-blown professor. So I wanted to share with you another factor in trying to decide to quit taking fentanyl, and if anyone seems to have a similar biochemical makeup that might suggest a medication that could work for me? I know I cannot make the trek to the closest city and state, ""I heard that my biochemical makeup might react better with 'X' medication"" because of all the drug seekers out there. But it would help me to know that there may be a medication that fits me biochemically. In addition, perhaps any of you can advise me how to communicate to a doctor that will listen to me. Are pain management doctors the best option? Again any insights would be appreciated. However, my pain management doctor in the city I recently moved told me that I had only two options to control my pain: the fentanyl patch or a morphine pump. I have more to share so I know some of you in the city might know that there are indeed other options. I would prefer a medication that does not affect me like fentanyl or morphine. And yes, I have decided to visit a psychiatrist to help me make this decision to quit the medication although I know the withdrawal from fentanyl is horrible. When I first moved to this small town, I consulted a fantastic general practitioner and explained how the fentanyl was affecting me. He gave me a prescription for the new oxycodone that is a time release. However, bless him, he did not realize that the fentanyl withdrawal is too powerful. For you women, I felt like I was in transition labor as I took the new medication and tried to withdraw from fentanyl. But the dilemma is that my pain is severe enough that without medication I cannot do daily tasks that most people take for granted, and I also in the past have become bed-ridden, when say on the 25 mcg patch or just vicoprofen alone. I do have four children, but my relationship with my husband that works 80 hours a week has become strained. He also steals 2/3 of my monthly vicoprofen, which I use as back-up for breakthrough pain. And he is to the point that he cannot handle any stage of the side effects from the fentanyl nor can he handle that I my overall health has deteriorated from this condition. So here are some more questions: Are there people in this group that have experienced the side effects I have? Has a psychiatrist helped you find medications to counter the side effects to fentanyl? Has anyone noticed a decrease in cognition or just a general feeling that your brain is not working at full capacity?  And I should add that I visited some of the best orthopedic surgeons that reviewed my case. There are so many issues with my back that any surgery will not alleviate pain. If anything, it will create more problems. Basically I was told I need to prevent osteoporosis, or my spine will collapse, which is a positive heads up at this stage of the game. And I just know that some of you are located in cities or towns that have doctors that are familiar with this medication. I am not so lucky now that we have relocated. But I know there must be an alternative solution to my problem. And probably like most of you, I too have done physical therapy, swim, etc., but I really need physical therapy five days a week--unfortunately insurance will not pay. So while I think it is a good move to visit the psychiatrist although she is new in her field, I do need advice in how to communicate to her. Am I correct to assume most psychiatrists might understand how this medication might affect the brain and exacerbate anxiety. Do you think that there is hope? I really need advice in how to communicate to both my general practitioner as well as the psychiatrist in what is happening with the fentanyl. However, I am just concerned with the potential options. At the least, the psychiatrist hopefully if she has any knowledge about fentanyl can help me explain to these new family members as well as my husband what is going on with this medication. What concerns me is if there is a miscommunication then what if I am diagnosed for a mental condition that I do not have? Or what if the suggested medications create a neurological change in my brain that will actually cause irreparable damage to my brain?  And the last bit of information, my sister who lives thousands of miles from me is afraid that my sister-in-law may actually suffer from some disease because both of her parents: the mother depression and the father some type of undiagnosed psychopathic tendencies believes that she is mirroring her on condition onto me. And furthermore, my husband does suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from his own childhood. Unfortunately, I don't feel the situation as it is--fentanyl side effects. I reach out to you because I think due to the communities like this, you may can look at my situation objectively and really offer some helpful advice because I am one of those people that have until several years ago was active in my community, church, and career as well as the most important factor in my life--my family. I need the hope that this old back will not deter me from becoming involve in my new town. Anyway, I have tried to share as many details as possible regarding my situation. It is my hope that some of you have been down a similar paths as myself, and you can offer me some advice in how to handle any aspect of this situation. At the least, I hope some of you can offer the support and understanding that I need at this stage. I do understand human nature, and if people do not experience your medical conditions; it is difficult for them to empathize.  Thank you so much in advance for reading my post and giving me some ideas or thoughts. I truly appreciate it because I just think it is unfair to burden my family that is far away, I truly feel alone and a bit misunderstood as well as hurt as the situation has unraveled in this new town with my husband's family that do not really know me.

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/law-changing-fentanyl-patch-dosage-3032587.html,Are law(s) changing on Fentanyl patch dosage?,"Six months or so ago my prescription for the fentanyl patch was reduced by my pain management doc from 100mcg to 75mcg. I have been on this dosage for 7-8 years or so and overall I've used them for about ten years.I really couldn't get a clear understanding as to the reason for the change but it seemed to be related to my emotional state. At that time I was having a great deal of mental/emotional difficulty adjusting to the sudden and unexpected loss of my only sister. (I also have other trauma and grief issues but they are, for the most part, manageable.) I ultimately ended up in the hospital for the first time in my life for mental health treatment. I have been on the patch for chronic pain from multiple auto accidents, the first one being when I was hit by a car when I was five years old. I have multiple herniated and bulging discs, degenerative disc disease and basically my spine is just an overall mess from top to bottome. I have some other physical issues as well and was thrilled when I discovered the patch as opposed to narcotic pills.  For me, I consider the ability of using the patch as a QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUE since I find the constant release of pain medication is much preferable to the ""roller coaster"" effect of taking narcotics in pill form. With pills I wasn't actually getting pain relief, I was just ""stupid"" and ""out of it"" for a few hours, the medicine would wear off, the pain began to ramp up again and I was watching the clock for when I could take the next pill. Not to mention that the dosage kept having to be adjusted higher and higher as my body adjusted to the amount I was taking. I haven't been doing as well with the lower dosage and after getting my emotional house in order I was ready to be more active but found I was pushing the outer boundaries of what the 75mcg patch could handle. I've recently asked to be taken back up to what was my ""normal"" dosage of the 100mcg but now I'm being told by the nurse practitioner that my current dosage of 75mcg is soon to be FURTHER reduced and that 50mcg is the highest dose that will soon be available to non-cancer patients!  When I questioned her if she thought (as I do) that it was in some part related to the overdoses by people using the fentanyl illegally she indicated she agreed with me and sympathized with my situation. I appreciated her honesty and understanding but unfortunately sympathy doesn't do much to address chronic pain. I also got the impression that even if my doc sympathizes and/or agrees with me it will be out of his hands. I live in Florida so I'm not sure it has to do with state law, federal law, the FDA, the manufacturer, lawsuits, etc. but I'm wondering if anyone else has been hearing rumblings of this sort. I got the impression from the nurse practitioner that the reduction could happen as early as my next appointment (April 2016). Just as an FYI: My breakthrough medicines are Tramadol and Baclofen and I RARELY take the full dosage I'm given. I have gone 2-3 months without even needing to refill them because I make an effort to take the least amount necessary for the maximum benefit.  I guess the bottom line is that I feel as though I'm being punished for the illegal actions of others and that no matter that I'm cautious with taking my medication as prescribed and honest with my health care team I will end up on the losing end on this one. I've faced what I believe to be a lot of misunderstanding among other healthcare practitioners as well and it just seems that instead of efforts to better educate the medical community and others involved in the situation it's easier to just ignore the needs of non-cancer chronic pain patients. It truly IS a quality of life situation for me. If my dosage is further reduced or if I'm put back on pills again it will be a painful and pointless step backwards and as best I can see it that will happen through no fault of my own. I'm truly open to any advice, information, etc. I'm not just looking for sympathy or someone to agree with me. I just want to understand why my very real pain is of lesser importance than the misguided yet truly tragic outcomes by the people who misuse this medication. "

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/any-schedule-iii-drugs-for-chronic-pain-184865.html,Any schedule III drugs for chronic pain?,"I welcome any comments/advice. I'm posting in this forum because I am seeking advice of those who are knowledgable in pharmacology. I need to know my options before discussing a med change with my doctor in 2 days. I am certain that I will be seeking opiate type medication to manage my pain at this time--that is not in debate. 1) Are there any other schedule III narcotic type medications (besides tramadol) that can be used long-term that do not have tylenol/NSAID's in them? and 2) What are some of the NSAID/opiate drugs that could be used for chronic pain, & are they available in extended release form and appropriate for long-term (1-2 yrs) use? *I most likely will need to go on schedule II drug in the near future, but would like to postpone it if at all possible--most of all, I want to be able to travel internationally for more than 30 days at a time., so for that reason I would like to avoid schedule II drugs if possible FOR NOW.  *see below for quick background* Lack of $, job and insurance is a big factor in mine & my doctors decision making. For that reason I've been taking methadone for the past 3 weeks now . . . no side effects, but no pain relief either (due to extra low dose no doubt). He started me on 5 mg/24 hr, then last 10 days 5 mg/2 x day. I understand the caution and slow titration. I'm also taking voltaren 150-200mg /day, which used to help, although not sure anymore my doctor wants me to continue with it for now. I've since read up more on methadone and while I feel it may help and be an excellent choice for me long term, I don't want the ball & chain that comes with it right now (having to have hard copy script every 30 days, mostly) because I want to travel during the next few years, before my mobility becomes more of an issue. I just hope I'm not asking for terrible physical withdrawl even though its only been 3 weeks of a low dose. Does anyone know if I'd have trouble making a switch? Maybe dropping the voltaren and taking something like vicoprofen (extended release if there is one?) I'm not trying to obtain huge pain relief, only enough to be semi-productive, which is hard to do without any meds. Quick background: chronic pain for many years (spinal injury/lots of degeneration/bone spurs/stenosis,ect... now dealing with thoracic outlet syndrome as well). Only in the last year have I decided to try managing pain with daily meds to help improve my (and in turn, my husband's) quality of life. Pain can get quite bad at times, but it's the losing battle of not being able to perform ADL's & get around that is most devestating. When I'm in a bad flare, it's a real challange to even get out of bed, much less shower and do basic chores without medication. I would also like to return to work--I'm currently trying to find something that won't cause more flares. **In reality, I've been in complete denial of my physical condition for years now and somehow thought through PT and other therapies that I may be able to reabilitate myself (even though my doc said otherwise)**For this reason, I'm only now considering daily opoids for chronic pain management. Of course, my first choice of tx would be PT, massage & accupunture instead of drugs, but I cannot afford it, am unemployed & don't have insurance. I know accupuncture helps me because I did it while I could afford to. I used to be totally opposed to taking medication . . . Fast forward-Sept 2009-I ask my pcp about pain management. We try voltaren (which I had success with in the past) and tramadol. (I'm aware that some say tramadol is no better than aspirin, but it does work wonders for some--we are all different. It did for me, it just didn't last). After 2 weeks of taking this I was actually receiving enough pain relief to greatly improve my life (got up to 2, 50mg tabs 2x day--problem was, if I took tramadol after 3pm or so, I had trouble sleeping--like I drank too much coffee), so I was able to be more productive during the day & took it easy in the afternoon/eve. Of course, after Christmas I wasn't getting the same pain relief or maybe my pain just worsened. . . I returned to my doctor 3 weeks ago telling him I was having increasing pain. He thinks with my issues (based on my films, ect... ) that I most likely will need long-term opiod therapy. Said he'd like to try me on oxycontin, but because of the cost he wanted me to try methadone instead (I have taken opioids in the past off & on, there's really no issue of abuse or addiction concerns & they have been effective--more so, I'm concerned with side effects and pain relief). It's also a community/low-cost clinic, so there's probably more red tape/limitations on what & how he can prescribe as well.  Thanks to all for reading this. Our health care system is in a real sad state, when people who need strong opiods are forced to go without due to abusers, while others are forced to rely on strong opiods instead of possibly taking something milder & receiving additional pain relief through natural therapies like accupunture, massage & physical therapy because of lack of insurance &/or $.

I am also having a lot of sinus problems with this, and last week I started using a nasal spray to help me to keep my sinuses open. Suddenly, a few days ago, my nose started plugging up more often, causing me to use the spray more often. Since getting up this morning I found I had to use it every couple of hours to keep my nose clear enough to use my oxygen. It's worsened as the day progressed and then by 4:00 this afternoon I was down to about an hour. Since around 7:00 tonight I'm plugging up completely every 5-7 minutes, and this is now a real problem. When my nose plugs completely like it is, I don't get the air I need, and of course with my nose completely plugged, I can't get enough air in.

My doctor's reasonings for the switch is that ""their are new studies showing that Oxycontin is not quite as safe as once believed and Tramadol is less habit forming"".  I have tried several other pain meds in the past with either not so great pain relief results or extreme GI issues.  I'd like to ask if anyone has had any similar experiences and what your opinions are. Thank you "

I weigh about 105 punds and my doctor had me on 6/ 30 mg perks a day (rococettes..cant spell) anyways ..long boring story short..wheni realized i was addicted and that i was taking them more for pleasure than pain..i made plans to go to a rehab in my area called SIlver Hill..very expesive... celeberties go there..top of the line (my poor parents), it was nicer than most hotels i have stayed at. Anyways... i continued taking my pills for 3 weeks till i had vacation time coming from work..and instead of going on vacation i went to rehab... fun fun fun!!! I went in there high as hell because of course i wanted to take as many pills as possible before i went since it would be my last time taking them..but scared as to what hell i had ahead of me. I had heard horror stories about opiate detox. When i got in there they gave me a choice of methadone or soboxone..at this time suboxone was very new..i know this becuase they doctor who asked me explained if i chose methadone i would have to do methadone maintence after i left, but if i chose suboxone, they could detox in my 5 day stay there and i would have to take no meds apon leaving. But they also told me that suboxone was a brand new drug and it was soo new that it had jst been approved for use and honestly i dont remember the details of the conversation which was about 7 years ago give or take..i just remmeber being nervous about taking it because of how new it was but i had decided anything was better than having to take methadone and have to do the maintence program. i was very nieve at this point because since then i have relapased enough times that i did methadone maintence for a year..and now back on suboxone. But my question is this: after chosing suboxone i was pleasently surprised that in my five day stay there i felt absulutley no withdrawal symptoms... maybe just tired ( which could have been the subs now that i thinik about it) and i left after 5 days feeling fine..and went home with no withdrwals symptoms at all..like i siad i was nieve back then so i could have possibly felt small withdrawals that i didnt know was withdrawals at the time..but i just rmemeber ing thinking this is it..this is what i have been so scared of ..it was apiece of cake even my mother was like you look great..so i dont understand now that i am on suboxone..how when i stop i will have to taper and there will be all these withdrawals..when at rehab they did a 5 day taper and i felt no discomfort at all during or after it. Now my question is because my boyfriend has a pill problem..and i know he wont do suboxone long term..( me i dont mind do it as a long term thing) but i have searched hours on line and havent heard or saw anyting about suboxone quick detox..everything is long term so to speak. But i know first hand that it is possible because 7 yrs ago..when i did it there wasnt even a option to take it home... it was only something u could do while inpatient. has anyone else heard anything abuut using suboxone to detox from perks or opiates..as a quick 5 day detox..is it possible to do it like that still..or was i maybe on a different form of suboxone back then because it was so new? i just know 100% i felt no withdrawals from my 5 day suboxone taper..that is proabably why going back was so easy a few years later because getting off for me for my first time was painless "

When I found myself running out before my refills were due, and either withdrawing or buying off the street, I decided it was time to quit. I got 5 Suboxone SLs from a friend and over two weeks weaned down. Started at one a day and ended with a little tiny piece (less then a quarter). To be honest I don't think it made a difference then if I would have just stopped the killers. It only delayed my detox for a day. Anyway I am on day 21. The physical withdrawals seemed to have stopped, but I still feel mentally something’s not right. Don't really know how to explain it I am very edgy and a little paranoid. It reminds me of a bad Acid trip I had once (but only a fraction of the intensity obviously). I was given Ativan 1MG by my doc and instructed to take 2 to help me sleep, and a half if needed during the day. But even the half makes me very drowsy. This would be great if I could sleep all day, but I take care of my 18mo old son. It seems like the only time I feel normal is when I drink (after my wife comes home of course). Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Reading all of your questions and posts really helped me through this point, especially in the first ""WEEK of HELL"". But I don't see to much information on the later stages of quitting Opiates. I can however offer some advise and or tips on how to get through the physical withdrawals to anyone in need.

One that is not afraid or unwilling to perscribe pain medication. It is really upsetting to see what the pain management practice has become in my area. Either doctors are too afraid to prescribe pain medication due to the overwhelming amount of abuse in the area or they are so in bed with the local pharmeceutical reps that they give you 10 brand new unproven, untested perscriptions that work for everything from high blood pressure to deppression. I cannot find a single doctor in my area that will perscribe me the medication that I need (oxycodone 15mg). They alll tell me when I get in their office that they don't perscribe perscription narcotics but they have new modern medications and procedures that will help just as much. I have done the injections, the nerve tests, the physical therapy, and all of the new modern medications that are ""proven to work"". The fact is, I have not found any of these modern ""pharmeceutical breakthroughs"" to provide anything but an endless list of side effects. The injections did help a little bit but nowhere near taking away all of my pain. I have had two surgeries in the past year and the last one did not go as planned. I am just looking for a decent, good hearted doctor who understands pain! I am sure I will find one eventually but I'm tired of just going down the list one by one in the phone book with little to no results. I have all of my xray's, mri's, surgeon's notes and my full chart from my last doctor who I saw for over two and a half years. My insurance changed and I had to stop seeing him.

I cannot?,"... afford the lap (surgery) and since long term use of narcotics is a bad idea my doctor started me on tramadol. Since there is no cure for endo., I'm looking at pain relief regularly (once a month for approx. a week) and I found that the tramadol does help. As problems have advanced, I started taking the tramadol more often and only allow myself two pills (50 MG each) every six hours and I try to keep the use at no more than six pills per day. The first few times I ran out of pills I thought I was getting ill because I didn't realize that I could actually be going through any sort of withdraw but I have seen this pattern after dealing with this drug for a few years now. Even with short term use, when I stop taking the tramadol I break out into cold sweats, I become depressed, I feel achey as if I'm getting the flu, I feel restless, and all I can think about is getting at least one pill to alleviate the problems I'm having. After researching tramadol withdraws I see that some of my problems match symptoms people have talked about and I'm a loss of what to do. The medication does help alleviate pain, but I obviously have to keep taking it otherwise problems set in. It seems apparent that I need to stop taking this drug permanently with these issues that arise when I stop taking it. Does anyone have any recommendations of any good pain relief that is not as problematic as tramadol and that also isn't a narcotic? My doctor has tried me on a series of NSAID's with little success and I myself would prefer to avoid hydrocodone/oxycodone, not to mention my doctor won't prescribe them for me. I admit, I am afraid to stop the tramadol but I obviously need to and I'm hoping I can find something that will help me that obviously won't cause as much problems as the tramadol does.

I had heard over the years that you could break an ER pill and it will fast act. I tried it and it was so helpful. For the first year after I started that I took half at 10am and half at 5 pm. The next year I started no longer feeling the affects so I started taking both halves at once at the same times each day. Once I got to 400mg I quickly wanted more. By the end of that upcoming year I was buying pills online as well as my regular script from my doctor. It started out at 180 pills of 50mg a month. Now after 5 years of use, I am buying 3-4 (180) 100mg pills a month online plus my regular script. I now start my day at 7am with 400mg and usually by 10am I do another 400mg then 2pm 6pm and 9pm. Sometimes I bump up to 500mg a dose. I did quit cold for a month simply because I couldn't afford it. I am up to $500 a month just on Tramadol. As I age my blood disorder increasingly deteriorates my body. I have become basically disabled due to my seizure disorder (was diagnosed as a result of my blood issues NOT the Tramadol). I now have money issues that I never used to have. I suffered terrible when I quit, it took 2 weeks to get past the withdraw, but the depression stayed with me... So I started again. I honestly feel much better using... I hate admitting that, but it is true. My honest issue is I simply hate the money involved and I hate the addiction. I know it is there, I can finally admit that. I don't like the anxiety of always needing it. Plus I worry about eventually ODing. It has yet to happen, but I know that as my tolerance increases the risk is there. Any suggestions???

The only way to fix it is to cut into the inside of my hip and sew the labrum back together (film wrapped around my hip socket)  Does anyone have any recommendations? I was wanting to ask my Dr. if there are any kinds of tests they can do on my body to see why my tollerance is so high with pain meds & to figure out what will help.  Thank you and many Blessings for your advise / experience regarding this matter. ~Shawna "

It's been a long haul with it... resetting,plates, pins, pins popping out and then had all the hardware removed. The doctor was looking at fusing my wrist because of my tiny bones and we had run out of options to fix it. Just prior to my seventh surgery (my last) I had an x-ray on the wrist and shocked everyone when my bone disappeared!!! So biopsies and scans. No explanation can be found... no virus or organism detected.  So for surgery the doc took pieces of me from everywhere inside my wrist and nothing was detected or found.  So about an inch or so of bone is missing on the outer bone in my wrist. The knuckle that is before your hand ( the bump on the outer edge) is gone... I'm so worried that more bone may dissolve and if so... how to stop it? I'm terrified!!  Add in severe chronic pain that I haven't got control over yet and some docs thinking Tylenol should cover it.  I'm on hydromorphone long acting, cymbalta, and prescription pain cream to rub in, couldn't take the pain pill that is in the cream due to bad side effects, so we are trying cream. I get tired easy, hard time focusing, my arm swells up and has now started a click sound that causes pain, this click is new.  Does anybody have advice or can relate t my circumstances?

I'm still in a lot of pain and have not received the results of the biopsy yet, to see whether it was caused by H. pylori. However I have a couple of questions regarding it! (I'm 19, and male and until all this appeared over the last ten weeks I was healthy. Should add I'm on omeprazole, citalopram and movicol for an impacted bowel)  Firstly, after I have had things to eat/in the evening it makes me feel very breathless and have a tight chest? Is this normal as I wasn't told about this, I understand that it will still hurt a lot but I'm worried it could be due to my heart because I've had some pains in my left arm as well. I'm hospital the only abnormal thing about my heart that was mentioned was the fact that my blood pressure was very up and down, even getting up to 148/92 at one point.  Secondly if my ulcer has been caused by H. pylori would it be unusual to get muscle aches all over my body, if it has been undiagnosed for a long time. I get constantly aching muscles and joints and these were all searched for through thorough blood tests at hospital returning nothing from tests like mono, Lyme disease, lupus etc, so I'm wondering if pylori can cause these, or could it be that my stomach just won't digest as well at the moment. I should also last I've lost a stone of weight reasonably quickly (over 6 weeks)  Any help on these couple of questions would be much appreciated! "

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/male-age-33-shoulder-pain-finger-twitching-3257838.html,"Male, age 33, shoulder pain and finger twitching?","For the past two years, I've had intermittent shoulder pain (always my left shoulder) that leads to twitching in my ring finger and some twitching in my middle finger. About six months ago, I realized that a potential cause of this was the walks I have with my dog. I walk him twice a day, everyday, always using my left arm - he's a stubborn dog and pulls a lot so I have to constantly pull back - I think this repetitive 'pulling back' motion eventually caused some shoulder damage. About six months ago I switched to a leash that gives me easier control over him. I also visited a neurologist at that time, and he ran me thru some general diagnostic tests (he tested reflexes, tested finger coordination, searched for numbness on other parts of my body, etc... ) and told me that he didn't see any signs of anything serious. However, yesterday I did a crossfit workout involving alot of upper body weight lifting and I noticed the shoulder pain came back shortly after the workout. Then the finger twitching began. Today most of the shoulder pain is gone but the finger twitching remains. The twitching is always localized to my ring and middle fingers on my left hand, never anywhere else. My concern right now is that the finger twitching is much more pronounced than usual - my middle finger has been visibly twitching all morning.  Do I have a pinched nerve causing this? Or something else that is causing the shoulder pain and finger twitching? Every time this happens it worries me quite a bit. "

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/ear-infection-3301595.html,Do I really have an ear infection?,So the past few days I've been in pain because of my ear. The first day I just noticed that my ear was sore when it started hurting and didn't think much of it. I thought maybe I slept on it wrong. And then the next day my ear gradually started hurting more and was swelling and the opening to my ear was almost swollen shut and by the end of the day I was in a lot of pain and was up most of the night because of it. So I decided to go to the doctor and he took a look in my ear and agreed that is was swollen and he said he couldn't see my eardrum because there was puss in front of it. He diagnosed me with Otis externa (swimmer's ear) and prescribed me some ear drops (neomycin-polymyxin) and I've been taking them as prescribed for a little less than 24 hrs but I haven't noticed my ear feeling any better. I was up most of the night again last night because the pain was so bad. And this morning when I woke up my ear was like completely swollen shut and the outside of my ear looked like it had some dried yellow puss on it? I don't know if I really have an ear infection because I wouldn't think I would be in this much pain. I called the doctor I saw yesterday to see if he could refer me to an ear doctor so I could see what his diagnosis would be. If anyone has any opinions that would be really helpful thank you.

He stopped cold turkey. He went through all the withdrawal symptoms and it took about a week for him to start feeling better. He went several more days without it, and some days I could tell he was hurting really bad again. (he hurt his back by twisting wrong, lifting something heavy in a masonry class) So, he started getting pills from her again. He had stopped in late april.

Weaned off Savella and now desperate for relief!?,"I was taking Savella for my fibromyalgia and it worked wonderfully for the pain. However, the side effects kept getting more extreme instead of better. I am a newlywed since July, and the extreme PMS symptoms were not helping my marriage. Things became unbearable! I was having terrible hot flashes with drops of sweat falling from my face and people at work asking if I was crying. My hair would be soaked and I would be nauseated! I was so irritable that I started to not even like myself! And I would start my period about every 4 days, really bad, for a day, then it would stop, even though I was on birth control pills. And i didnt want my poor husband to touch me! I constantly ate, ate, ate, and have gained at least 10 or more lbs! I am now completely weaned off the Savella and had forgotten how badly the fibro can hurt. Until the last few days... ugh! I have a doc appointment in 2 days but have to work tomorrow. It is my 2nd job that really don't want to mess up since I am hoping to be hired fulltime. However, I may not be able to work tomorrow because I have started hurting pretty badly early this afternoon and just not too much better. Any short term or long term suggestions?

Then After taking Exemestane 25mg for MBC (metastatic breast cancer) I started having pain in my Hips, Pain and weakness in my Arm that would not go away. One day I would wake up no pain and the next the pain was back… I found out I have Bone and Liver Mets. I began radiation on my Arm and will begin additional treatment for Liver soon. My Liver Mets is suspected to be Breast cancer too. Since then we have been trying to manage the pain. I started by taking 7.5MG Oxycodone / 500 Acetaminophen - I thru up and was miserable for the entire day with a raging headache… regained my composure and tried again with food. Was still quite sick… My Radiation Oncology Nurse dropped me down to 5-325. Still sick and reduced to 1/2 a pill to work myself up again and still sick, brain felt like it was melting. Switched to Tramadol 50MG that got me through a few days then started to make me sick. Talked to my Radiation Oncology Nurse for something else, and she gave me Hydrocodone / Acetaminphen 5-325. Which was ok. I asked to get the Acetaminophen out of the equation because of my recent Liver situation. Now I am told that because I take Bupropion XL 300 I can't have the straight Hydrocodone. But which I find funny I can have it with Acetaminphen, and I can have Ocycodone alone but it makes me sick. I always thought it was the Acetaminphen that makes you sick but it is the opiod that makes you more sick. ***Question*** now I got all these pills -- I have taken the straight Oxycodone 5MG for two days and only 3 times. If I try to take more it makes me sick. Do you think I can switch to Tramadol ? without harm or add it… ? I had a biopsy yesterday and I got Fentinal prior to the procedure… that was the best I felt in days… ? "

I have had unprotected sex approximately 6 times this month since my last period. about 2 days ago I noticed spotting but my red pills dont start for another week so I wasnt sure what that meant. (Since the termination I've had three months of normal periods that were right on time with no spotting) I figured my period was just going to start early but I still have only been spotting throughout the day very little off and on. I have 4 more pills before my period starts and I'm just wondering what is going on. I don't think I'm pregnant and I know early spotting isn't exactly a sign of pregnancy although some sights say it can be implantation. But I also know because I regularly forget my pills and have to take them the next night while regularly having unprotected sex it is possible, although I don't see why it would happen now. I'm curious as to what would cause me to spot lightly for two days, a week before my period. Keep in mind this has never happened to me before so I don't think missing my pill the other night and taking it the next day caused this because I've done that for years and never had spotting a week before my period. I've never had spotting for any reason. "

My girlfriend of 25 has crohn's disease, she has had it for who knows how long, but has been trying to find out for this past year. upon having it and being diagnosed. She has been prescribed medicine to treat for the ulcers, and also Tramadol and Prozac to deal with the pain and stress. Lately for unknown reasons still, she had been taking more than normal of the tramadol, and still taking prozac. she then had taken a xanax during this time. and when I believe to make her not fully coherent on the reality of things, and she is very forgetful and just not herself, when I found out and noticed these symptoms. I had her taken to the ER and then had her treated which led me to find out that this is what happened. she was there yesterday and today she was sent to a place to be evaluated to make sure she was not dangerous to anyone or herself.. and earlier this morning when she was still at the hospital, she seemed pretty coherent and alert than she was, but later tonight upon visiting her after she was transported, she was back to being incoherent... I should also add on the subject during this period when she was taking them more than normal and when this happened was wednesday 11/13/13 to now 11/16/13 she had only had maybe 4 hours of sleep total before she was made to sleep this morning. I guess my question is what anyone might think is happening, I have heard that even though it isn't in her blood or urine that it is still in her system and it will take a while to get it out. but I'm worried if this is permanent, or if her being at home with family and friends and me would be better for her.. and what I should expect when she is released?
