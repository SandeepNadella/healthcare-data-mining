I have read so many different things online lately & thank god for that or I would probably be telling you right now how I'm on 1000mg of suboxone(exaggeration) because I wanted a 'pain free, no withdrawl miracle drug'. Please realize that I am not discrediting suboxone-I know how helpful it has been to so many people. I do admit to being somewhat of a cynic though due to my own experiences which include kicking hydrocodone, oxy, morphine, heroin and worst of all methadone(cold turkey after being on it for 2yrs straight- did wean down to 20mg before jumping off). I know I am NOT a dr by any means. I have worked in the medical field off & on for the last 14yrs(my whole adult life~I'm a 32yr old female). I just need a little something besides clonidine and seroquel(for sleep/agitation-both previously prescribed to me) to help ease the worst of the withdrawls & was curious to know if anyone had used or heard of someone using suboxone just as a buffer(per say) in just the first few days of kicking? I have quite a few norco too but I DON'T want to touch them anymore. I have to take 20+/day just to not want to jump off a bridge- no joke! They don't even make me 'feel good'~ Not to mention how much acetaminophen that all adds up to.  So if anyone has any experience OR opinion with what I'm asking/referring to~ please feel free to answer/comment/whatever. Thanks! "

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/weird-headache-sensation-possible-sertraline-side-2509171.html,Weird headache/sensation: possible sertraline side effect?,"I started taking 50mg sertraline almost a week ago for anxiety induced headaches and OCD. I started to get chronic headaches around mid October and after being referred to a neurologist, he diagnosed me with anxiety and prescribed me xanax to help deal with the headaches. He also scheduled an MRI just to be safe which turned out to be normal. The xanax helped a bit, but I decided I didn't want to become dependant and decided to seek a more long term solution to my anxiety. Went back to the neurologist and he prescribed me Zoloft. I was still having headaches and slight vision problems but after being on 50 mg for a couple days, I began having my usual chronic headaches accompanied by a strange sensation in my head when I breathed in. It's hard to describe. It's kind of like a rush of dull pain that intensifies as I breathe in. It's dizzying and unrelenting and seems to creep up on me as the day goes by, becoming the worst at night. The painful headaches have subsided slightly the past day or so, but this dizzying and unpleasant sensation has lingered and is becoming slightly worse. My head also feels full and seems to feel ""fuller"" when I breathe in. Has anyone else experienced this sensation and could it just be a side effect of the zoloft? Or could it be part of my pre-existing headaches, unrelated to the zoloft? "

I read some sexual side effects from this drug and am concerned to exactly what people experience. I know everyone is different. By sharing experiences I will have a pretty good idea what to expect and maybe what to do to deal with it. All my sexual life it takes me at a minimum a half hour and usually closer to an hour to cum. Sometimes I would stop as either my partner or me, sometimes both of us, were ready for a rest. If this drug makes it harder for a male to cum I wonder if I will ever experience that while taking this drug. In reality, how long does a person really want to spend having sex. Especially the woman as I fear this will put a burden on her to want to satisfy me at the cost of her not enjoying it anymore. I am moving to a different state to be with my woman and really do not want this drug to be an issue with our love life. I currently take Cymbalta 60 mg one time daily and Welbutrin SR 100 mg two times a day. My doctor told me to stop these two drugs when the Effexor arrives. I get it free from Pfizer thru their program for low income people. Any comments from both men and women on the side effect with your sex life and any ideas what you did to overcome this will be greatly appreciated. I understand this is an awkward topic to discuss in a public forum. Anyone can post here without giving any personal information. And lets be honest. We all desire a healthy sexual life as it is a normal part of our makeup.  Thank you in advance for your help. :0) "

I will start off by saying that I have been using opiates for about 3 years now. It started with vikes..then perks..then methadone and now I am a mess. My whole life has been ruined. Before the methadone I was taking 5 percocet 10mg at a time and it wasnt even giving me a buzz (This is also after being on percocet for over a year). I am a 22 year old girl and I only weigh about 120lbs... My tolerance was sky high. What made me hit rock bottom was when I got a hold of a bunch of methadone and started using that because it made me feel normal... i was taking 10-20 10mg methadone a day for the last 6-8 months. Last thurs I ran out of methadone and was using percocet to get through the withdrawals. Finally enough was enough and I got a hold of this AMAZING suboxone dr. I had my induction on Tues..but the problem was I took 5 15 mg roxies at 4 am before my induction. When I got my first 8mg dose of Sub I immediately went into precipitated (?sp?) withdrawal for about an hr... then I started to feel a little more comfortable. The comfortable feeling didnt last so I took another 8mg pill later that night. Tuesday night was the worst night of my life I did not sleep a wink I had the worst wd pains the RLS..the hot and cold flashes that run through ur body and make u feel awful and of course the diarrhea and the stomach pain (and anxiety feeling) right above my belly button. On wed my dr increased my sub to 3x a day (8mg) slowly by taking halves. STILL NO RELIEF? I slept last night maybe for 2 hrs at best and I am completely miserable. I took my sub this morning and still I am uncomfortable and miserable and I cant even take anything to relieve my twitchy legs or my anxiety belly pains or the INTENSE hot and cold flashes. I have even considered suicide (I also suffer from bipolar)..I can't do this anymore. Does anyone have any good advice? I need help before I do something that I can't take back. No one in my life understands how hard it is to feel these symptoms CONSTANTLY for days on end while I can't sleep or barely sit down. My dr will be calling me today to see how the 3X a day is doing..and I have my second appt tomorrow... but I am just not hopeful. To top things off my fiance who was my partner in crime with using..he is feeling completely normal from 2 8mg a day. He sleeps and isn't suffering at all. I am hysterically crying right now bc I can't deal anymore. PLEASE HELP!!! thank u!! 
Opiate Withdrawal,https://www.drugs.com/answers/how-much-longer-can-opiate-withdrawal-hell-on-384525.html,How much longer can opiate withdrawal (hell on earth) last?,"Friends: I need some help here. I have been off of opiates (perks, oxy's, dilaudid) for 23 days. I have been taking them daily for 4 years and have been dopesick hundreds of times, and have never made it this far. I am still having monster withdrawal. I am still sneezing, having diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, and anxiety that is INTOLERABLE. I have been taking a few klonopin, and it helps with anxiety and sleep. I only had 5, and i only got 5 for a reason. I do NOT want to become physically dependent on benzo's as the kick from them is so much worse than opiates. My line of work is a drug counselor and i dont want to seem like i know everything. I know what to tell, and how to encourage OTHER PEOPLE, but not myself. This seems like a never ending story. I still have no energy. I know the length of time varies. I went to rehab and seemed to do better when i was there, as my days were full. Now i am home, my kids go off to school, and i spend my days fighting everything. I dont have the energy to shower, but i make myself. Everything is a chore. Am i ever going to feel better? If so, how soon. I am on the verge of relapse or reversion cuz i feel like i cant take it ONE MORE SECOND. I swear, i wouldnt wish this on my worst enemy, and would rather battle some life threatning illness than ever go through this again. And, if you have ever kicked ops, you know that every minute seems like an hour and the days are long. Will i ever be normal again? I have seen others get through it, but its just not happening for me. Please help me with some advice, encouragement or kind words. Thank you friends. P.S. I CANNOT do the NA meetings. Ive tried. God Bless the people for whom it works. I dont knock it, its just not for me. "

I sam 28 Yrs old. I have been taking methadone on and off for about ten years. In the last 3 of those 10 years I have been taking 5mg every day. The last 6 months I have been taking 7.5 and sometimes 10mg a day instead of the 5mg, a couple times a week. Last week was the first time I didn't take it for almost 3 days in about a year. the first full day started off with what I hear are typical withdrawal symptoms..runny nose, sneezing, teary eyes, nothing horrible. But that morning when I woke up, WHOA, I had never experienced back pain like that. It was horrible. I couldn't lay, I couldn't stand. I took some advil and kept low key, but that night it just got worse and worse. I was so tired but I couldn't sleep and my back was on fire. I made it halfway through the third day and just couldn't take the back pain (I have never had back pain issues) and I kept having MASSIVE panic attacks (Once again, I have never had panic attack issues) so I took a methadone to make myself feel better. I don't even know the first step to stop. I want to stop, that was a wake up call. I now accept that I am addicted to methadone. No one knows,not my husband, my friends..no one. Ive kept it hidden very well. I just want to know how much worse will the withdrawal get? I always just figured 5 mg was no big deal and I would never have a problem stopping whe I wanted to. Can I withdrawal at home? I cant afford to take time off from work to go to a rehab. I have heard about suboxene..is this an option. I just don't know what to do.

Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,https://www.drugs.com/answers/period-is-different-this-month-been-on-birth-484150.html,Period is different this month? Been on birth control for 7 months!?,"Ok so I have been on birth control (tri-sprintec) for 7 months now. Usually I start my period on the 3rd sugar pill at some point during that day. This month I started on the 4th which I know isn't that big of a change, but it's the first time it has started later so that freaked me out. What is actually weird though is that I had spotted in the morning so I put on a pad and tampon and then changed both about 4 hours later. I noticed I hadn't bled that much (practically nothing was on the tampon) then later when I took out the other tampon there was still only a little bit of brown blood on it. I didn't put another tampon in after that. I went to the bathroom about 2 hours later to see that I hadn't bled AT ALL. Then I started bleeding a little bit after that but not nearly as much as I usually do. Then it was really light again, then it got a little bit heavier. I went to the bathroom once and had a big clot come out like I normally do. And sometimes when I wipe the blood is a bright red, but seems to have a little bit of a mucusy substance in it. I have had pretty bad cramps, a little worse than usual. I am usually very heavy on the first day of my period. It is just really weird to me that my period is so light when I'm usually so heavy and that I started a day later than usual. I had sex once this month with a condom, but I just am worried that this could possibly be implantation bleeding? Or maybe just a change up in my period? What does everyone think? "

I was riding a bike and it slipped after I applied the breaks. For a second, my left leg took the weight of the bike. After that, the bike felled down on the road.  Something went wrong in my left knee. After accident, there was no bruising or swelling or redness on the knee. There was no pain either. I drove to my work after the slip. At work, I sat on the chair. When I got up from the chair I had a sudden pain in my left knee. After 10-15 seconds the pain went away. Every time I got up after sitting, I would have this kind if pain. This continued for about 6-8 months. After that time, the problem of sudden pain on getting up went away. But the pain in the knee continued. Now I have pain in the knee that increases and decreases. On some days, the pain is more. On some days the pain is less. Even though I have pain, I can walk and climb stairs. I can even run, but the pain would increase after running. The pain especially increases after travelling by train or bus. I have taken treatments from 3 or 4 orthopedic doctors. I have also taken physiotherapy treatment that consisted of ultra-thermal and ultra-sound treatments and exercises. I have taken painkillers and anti-inflammation drugs. I have worn knee cap for a long time. I have taken Glucosamine and Methylsulfonylmethane supplements for a long time. None of these treatments have cured the problem. The X-Ray of the knee does not show any fracture or bone damage. On recommendation of a doctor, I got MRI scan of the knee. The MRI scan report is as below: ---  Findings: ---  Evidence of edematous anterior cruciate ligament with hyperintensity at proximal attachment with intact fibers suggest interstitial injury. Small baker cyst is seen along medial head of gastrocnemius muscle. Anterior & posterior horns and body of medial and lateral menisci show normal intrinsic intensity with smooth articular surface. No evidence of discontinuity or parenchyma signal abnormality seen. Posterior cruciate ligament shows normal homogeneous signal intensity. No evidence of discontinuity, fibre retraction or periligamentous abnormality. Femoral and tibial attachment of both ligaments appears normal. Medial and lateral collateral ligaments show normal signal intensity and attachment. No evidence of retraction seen. Medial and lateral retinaculum appears normal. Quadriceps tendon and patello tibial ligament appear normal. Hoffa's fat pad appears normal. Visualized muscles of quadriceps and hamstring group appear normal.

Obesity,https://www.drugs.com/answers/anyone-experienced-rapid-weight-gain-viibryd-706599.html,Has anyone else experienced RAPID weight gain on Viibryd?,"My doctor started me on Viibryd about a month ago after I'd been on Lexapro for years and it had stopped working as well. I did the standard step-up dosage pattern with the starter pack... started at 10mg and was up to 40mg by the 3rd week. I should mention that I am anorexic and bulimic and my doctor is well aware of this, and when he told me about this new Viibryd medication I adamantly stated that I CANNOT be on anything that causes weight gain. (I also take 450mg of Wellbutrin XL and have been for several years now.) So he promised me that Viibryd doesn't cause weight gain and I agreed to start taking it. A couple of years ago, I lost a ton of weight (110 pounds) through diet and tons of exercise and managed to stay at about 100-105 pounds for a good 6 months, even AFTER I stopped exercising completely. Well, suddenly I started gaining weight rapidly about a month ago, and so I freaked out and started going to the gym again and working out hardcore (which I know produces results because that's how I've lost weight and kept it off in the past) and immediately changed my eating habits. Yet I'm still steadily gaining weight at an alarming rate and the only explanation I have for it is that it's the Viibryd. I know it's not normal to exercise hardcore, eat healthy, and STILL gain weight. I now weigh 120 pounds and the number has just steadily climbed up since I started Viibryd. I don't understand this at all. I weigh myself everyday and monitor every single thing I eat. I track my caloric intake religiously and I know exactly how many calories I've burned during my workouts, and nothing can account for this weight gain other than the medication. If anything, I should be LOSING weight since I just went from sitting on my butt all day to an hour of cardio a day, but this is not the case. In the 3 weeks since I started working out hardcore, I've gained 5 pounds (no, it's not from fat converting to muscle). I think Viibryd needs to be tested more and an updated report of side effects needs to be published. No amount of depression in the world is worse than weight gain for me, so it's ironic that an anti-depressant is causing me to want to kill myself due to a side effect that seems to be a lot more common than the pharmaceutical companies would have you believe. I'm going to stop taking the Viibryd as of today and I don't care what my doctor has to say. I'm hoping I'll be able to take off the 10 pounds I've gained in the month since I started Viibryd once I stop taking it. I'll make sure to post an update to this thread once I've tapered myself off to let everyone know if anything changes. I'm just really upset because I was led to believe this medication wouldn't cause any weight issues. I've also had an increased craving for sweets, but I haven't given in to it because I know what sweets do. I'm also incredibly bloated since starting the Viibryd. Has anyone else had similar experiences with weight gain and this medicine and past eating disorders? "
Obesity,https://www.drugs.com/answers/can-alprazolam-cause-weight-gain-or-weight-loss-379682.html,Can alprazolam cause weight gain or weight loss?,"I'm 23, and I suffer from horrible panic attacks, anxiety, insomnia. Just thinking about laying down for the night gives me a rapid heartbeat and chest pains. My adrenaline rushes come on so strong I can almost taste it in the back of my mouth.  When I'm having a really, really bad night, I take a .50mg alprazolam. The stress is still in the back of my mind and a chest pain will hit me once or twice when I'm thinking about it too much. But generally, it helps me calm down enough to finally sleep, even if it takes a few hours.  In the last year, I've gained a lot of weight and my stress levels have gone through the roof. I suspect I suffer from estrogen dominance, brought on by adrenal depletion, excess cortisol, and causing hypothyroidism (in other words, that my stress levels throw my hormones out of balance).  I'd like to avoid the drastic, expensive, and unpromising progesterone hormone therapy for estrogen dominance at all cost but have yet to find an effective alternative.  Several other women in my family are taking alprazolam, and I haven't seen any adverse effects. In fact, I've only seen positive effects in their mood. They haven't noticeably lost or gained any weight, but then again, they don't exercise or diet consistantly, whereas I follow a rigorous (but healthy) program.  So I was wondering if possibly taking alprazolam could lower my stress levels enough to bring down my cortisol levels, balance my hormones, help me lose weight and live a generally normal life? Or can alprazolam possibly cause weight gain? Does it have any effect on weight at all?  From the reviews I've read, alprazolam is great for anxiety and depression, and many people are happy with it. I'd like to hope it would help me with my problems, but I can't risk gaining any more weight.  If anyone's been able to lose or has gained weight and believes it is due to alprazolam, please let me know. "

I got very ill from a new pain medication and lost so much weight my MEDTRONICS UNIT started to come thru my skin and had to have it removed. I went to the CCF PAIN MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT where they removed the MEDTRONICS UNIT and talked me into a new device called THE DRG IMPLANT. It has been in me since October 11th, 2016 and I haven't slept more than 2 hours a night since then. CCF PAIN MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT does not believe in giving pain medication to anyone and this unit is causing my restlss legs to start every morning and not stop no matter what adjustment is made to my unit. Henceforth, my Requip was increased to 6mg every day. Although I did need to gain some weight, 25 pounds since my Requip was increased was a bit much. The CRPS in my right leg is from a knee replacement done in 2010 that I have suffered severe pain with every day since having the surgery done. 25 additional pounds is alot of weight for my already shot knee to bear, plus the fact that the Requip has increased my RLS 200%.

I never had to take any medication for it at the time But even having pcos I have been skinny my entire life up until the last two years. I have weighed 120 lbs all my life and two years ago I started gaining weight rapidly and now I currently weigh 218 lbs. with no change in diet or exercise I couldn’t figure out the cause of why I was gaining weight so quickly. I went to several different doctors and they had no answers for me but I knew something was wrong with me. I finally went to a fertility clinic specialist and she had told me it was my pcos and did an ultrasound and blood work to confirm It. I was so relieved to finally find out the cause of everything and she put my on a low estrogen birth control as well as metformin. When I first started taking the metformin it made me so sick I couldn’t function. I called my doctor and told her what was going on and she had said I should try taking it at night when the worst of the symptoms are while I was sleeping and to start off taking half of a 500 mg for a week (which would be 250 mg) then the next week increase it by alternating one day take half then the next day take the full pill, and keep doing that process till the desired dosage I was prescribed. Honestly this was a GAME CHANGER! I now am able to take 2,000 mg every night. i never had any terrible symptoms when I did it like this. And I wish doctors wouldn’t recommend taking it during the day because that is when you will be the most sick. Taking it during the night helps a ton.  I did notice a little weight to come off but not a ton. It has been almost a year since I have been on metformin and I haven’t noticed a dramatic weight loss. I have lost maybe 20 lbs. I still feel like I have the symptoms. I have terrible hot flashes, acne, my hair falls out, chronic UTI’s, vaginal changes, etc. I do stick to the low carb diet I’m supposed to and I am eating healthier than I ever had and getting plenty of exercise, and I still can’t seem to lose the weight. But my concern is why did I all of a sudden gain all this weight in the last 2 years even though I have had pcos since I was 12 years old and I was stick thin? I feel like there is something else wrong with my body and I can’t seem to figure out but I know I’m my gut that something else is wrong and I just want to be how I used to two years ago.

My question is how long does it take for the brain to re-develop new pathways to deliver serotonin naturally?

Major Depressive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/vivid-dreams-nightmares-hallucinations-viibryd-3355935.html,Vivid dreams/nightmares and hallucinations on Viibryd?,"Hi, I'm new here so I apologize if I do anything wrong. I'm a 22 year-old female who started Viibryd about a month ago for anxiety and depression after zoloft had shown no results. I take 40 mg of Viibryd every morning and it has helped my anxiety a lot and lightened my mood a little bit. I've done lots of research on the drug but there are some questions I can't find the answers to so I was wondering if anyone can help me. I've been having VERY vivid dreams and nightmares, which I found is quite common, but I'm starting to have trouble dealing with them. They can be very disturbing and I'll wake up in a panic and really shaken up in the morning or middle of the night. Sometimes I am afraid to fall asleep/go back to sleep. An example would be just last night I had a dream that I was experiencing sleep paralysis (I heard is also common; I've had it twice before starting viibryd and multiple times after) and I could not get out of it. I can usually tell when I'm about to go into sleep paralysis so I can prevent it. When I can't, I can get myself out of it using a method I learned (so it hasn't been too hard to live with), but this dream was very scary because I went through all the steps I usually do and nothing was working. I was clearly in my room on my bed, making it seem more real. I tried calling out to my dad, whose room is right across from mine (also like that in real life), and was able to make some noises but my ability to shout started to go away until I couldn't make any noise at all. My dad was so close yet so far. I felt someone crawling over me and saw their fingers creep along my hand. Panicked, I started just shaking and shaking in my dream until I eventually woke up. I realized it was a dream, but I was very shaken from it. I checked the time and it was only 3 am. I had slept for 2 hours. I was too afraid to go back to sleep and very frustrated because I still had a whole night's sleep ahead of me. I didn't know what to do. After checking the time, I saw a small, dark, moving figure in my pitch-black room and decided it was my cat. (Disclaimer, I'm 100% sure I was awake). Then, I saw another one not far from the first and started to panic again. I turned my night light on and found that one was in fact my cat while the other was a pair of boots on my floor. This brings me to the hallucinations. I found that after starting Viibryd, I started to see random black or white spots floating through the air. It didn't worry me because I knew they weren't real and they were small and not scary. Then, I started to see things move out of the corner of my eye. I would turn and nothing was moving. It's usually an inanimate object that's already there. I don't create new things in my mind, I just see objects move that aren't supposed to be moving. Then I had the incident last night where I clearly saw a shadowy figure moving, not like walking or going anywhere far, just kinda like swaying in place or moving part of it's shadowy body. It's hard to describe. Seeing things move is very unsettling and can often be scary, especially since I live in a house alone most of the time. I am a college grad living at home with my dad. My dad works 2 days a week then spends most of the week at his girlfriend's, making him home at night usually 3 times a week and usually never around in the morning. I enjoy being alone and am usually ok, but I find some nights/mornings to be difficult. The night's are the hardest because the dark makes everything scarier. I haven't found any personal stories or accounts of people hallucinating on Viibryd, only websites that say it's a possible side effect. Has anyone on here ever had hallucinations from the drug? Can you tell me your experiences with it? Also, I know the vivid dreams and nightmares are common, but has anyone found some kind of method(s) to reduce them or make them go away all together? I would really like to stay on Viibryd. Thank you very much. "
Major Depressive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/lexapro-2-days-3372979.html,Took Lexapro for 2 days HELP?,I have had mild anxiety for about 10 years that I was able to handle without medication. about five years ago it got worse so I went to a doctor and was put on Prozac 10 mg. I took that for a few months and didn’t notice much results so stopped taking it. Recently my anxiety has increased a lot so I went back to see a doctor and was prescribed Lexapro 10mg. I took it the first day and had crazy panic attacks all day long. I felt derealization and it was terribly scary because I didn’t know what it was. I’ve read that you have to get through the side effects for it to work so I took it again the next day and had even worst panic attacks. Almost went to the emergency room 100 times. I am now taking my Klonopin way more than I ever have. I haven’t taken the Lexapro for two full days now (doctor said to stop) and I’m not feeling good. I can’t stop crying and the anxiety is out of control. I can only sleep for two hours at a time and wake up pouring sweat and panicking. Will this ever end?

I dealt with the side effects well on the first dose, and started feeling the positive effects at pretty much exactly 4 weeks. My doctor and I decided to go to 300mg and the side effects were about the same as the first time around, but a bit more intense, still handled it well though. I’m at a few days past 4 weeks on 300 and I’m wondering if it’s still plausible to be having slightly anxious thinking with a low grade subtle headache at this point? Considering it’s a larger dose and all... maybe? Is it plausible to feel side effects period up until the point where the new dose kicks in? I’m hoping I still have some adjusting to do and don’t have to go back to 150mg. Thanks. Side note: this is meant to supplement the Zoloft I’ve been on for 3 years, I'm trying to counteract the weight gain side effect I got from Zoloft with bupropion, and so far that part has worked well.

I also believe I was prescribed Lamictal as mood stabilizer as well since I’m titrating my dose up every 2 weeks. Next time I see my pdoc my dosage will be increase to 100 mg. (unless I opt out on increasing it) As far as prescribing me Lamictal as a mood stabilizer, I really don’t understand why to be honest, because I don't have mood cycling of highs and lows. I have dysthymia. My depression is chronic and always low. I’m going to ask my doctor on my next appointment why I was put on Lamictal. It doesn’t make sense if I was prescribed it for mood disoreder. The people I trust and let know I was put on a mood stabilizer agree with me also that I’m not bipolar.  Anyways, I have two questions. After reading about lamictal I keep on reading how Lamictal can cause hair loss and weight gain. If that’s really the case why can lamictal cause this side effect? Does lamictal affects one hormone? If that’s the case which hormone does it affect? This is important to me because I have high cholesterol and I’m too young to have complications because hormone imbalance. I also want to know what I’m taking. Your help is appreciated "

I waited 4 days and after upping the dosage felt REALLY weird so went back on the 150mg. Last week I tried upping the dosage again and same thing happened, I had severe anxiety (freaking out about having a seizure), fuzzy head, when I went to bed and shut my eyes I could see vivid images and colours and when I opened them again the whole room was going in and out of focus. Needless to say that caused another anxiety attack ! So I went back on the 150mg.  I am starting to feel like it's not working anymore however I am scared to up the dosage again. I spoke to my doctor who said it was because of my weight (I am 5'3 and 108lbs) but I am really not feeling ok on just the 150mg. I also wasn't aware that weight could be an issue when it comes to medication? Any insight would be much appreciated!! I have been through hell and back with medications having been on countless SSRI's, SNRI's, then Adderall for ADD (which I stopped after 2 years after having extreme addiction and bad, BAD ""come downs"" every single day when the drug wore off.

The last few years since I have been sober, I wouldn't say I felt great, but not bad either.. just not as happy as I think a person should be. As of November this year I started to feel noticeably depressed, and unmotivated to work and do much of anything. I want to lay in bed even though I am not sleepy. Nothing in my social life has changed, and my doctor said sometimes you can't pin-point a reason and it's caused just by a chemical imbalance. I tried Zoloft, and spiraled down to where I could not even function for the 2 weeks i was on it and tried sticking it out. So i tapered off of that. After 2 weeks of being off zoloft, I just started taking escitalopram (5 mg) yesterday. I noticed it's much more pricy, and I had to try the zoloft before I ""qualified"" for lexapro. I know everyone is different, but generally how does this med work and how long until it takes effect?

Then, I had to stop it so the insurance could make me try (and fail) metformin for a couple of weeks (which I knew was going to happen).

Major Depressive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/mirtazapine-several-issues-mirt-love-feedback-3476226.html,Mirtazapine - I am having several issues with mirtazapine and would love some feedback.,"I started on a combo of 30 mirtazapine /75 Effexor at the beginning of November and it worked great. It pulled me out of a longtime depression and gave me my life back. The only problem was constant and untouchable hunger! I also gained some weight, as many do on mirtazapine. I can accept the extra pounds, but the hunger has just been really hard to deal with.  So I tried to go down on the mirtazapine . and switch to Wellbutrin mid January (while keeping the Effexor in place). I went down to 15mg for 2 weeks and felt fine. That gave me the confidence to go to 15mg every other night. The plan was I would do that for 2 weeks then switch to 150mg of Wellbutrin. This has all been done with a primary doctor that I really like, by the way. The problem is that after a week on the 15mg mirtazapine every other night, the depression came back, so I was left with a choice: ride out the depression over the next week on the low dose of mirtazapine so I could make the switch to Wellbutrin or go back up on the mirtazapine to regain my stability for a while before trying again (hopefully with a plan to make the switch to Wellbutrin more quickly). After feeling so good after feeling so bad for so long, I decided that stability was most important for now, so I went back up to 15Mg mirtazapine every night. Well, after a week of that, my depression was still as bad, so on Sunday, my primary doctor had me go back to the 30mg. It has only been two days, but I am still depressed today and am just worried that whatever effect the mirtazapine had before is somehow lost.  SO! After that long-winded backstory, these are my questions:  1. Is it possible for the mirtazapine to just stop working or not be as effective this time around? And how long should I give it before I know?  2. If it does start to work as well as before, but the hunger persists: Is there any truth to the idea that the hunger isn't as bad at the higher doses? I have also heard some people say that the hunger lessened for them after a few months. Has anyone experienced that?  3. Has anyone taken both mirtazapine and Wellbutrin? Did you find one to be better than the other?  Thank you all in advance! "

Major Depressive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/long-cymbalta-leave-system-3034501.html,How long will it take for the Cymbalta to leave my system?,"... For the better part of 30 years, I have suffered from depression. In 2009, I was involved in a very serious auto accident that left my body broken and my brain damaged. About 2 months after my accident I had a mental breakdown and found myself in the local mental health facility, where I was prescribed Cymbalta.   Within a few weeks I started to feel “normal” for the first time in my life. I was having some side effects but was assured that once the medicine was well into my system the side effects would abate. The vomiting started before I left the hospital and has not stopped for 6 years. As did the bladder irritation. Why did I keep taking it? Well, another Psychiatrist told me that the continued vomiting could not possibly be from the Cymbalta it must be from my head injury and the pills were increased. I saw an urologist that said my bladder irritation was interstitial cystitis and gave me yet another pill that made me even sicker so I stopped taking it.  Four years ago I woke up to welts all over my hands that didn’t go away for some time so back to the doctor I went. I was then sent to a rheumatologist that for a year suspected Lupus, for the next year it was RA, then just to make sure she covered her bases she suspected HAE. This whole time the welts are getting worse and again the Cymbalta was increased to help with my constant joint and muscle pain.  In October of 2014 I forgot to take my Cymbalta for 3 or 4 days which sent me down a deep hole and a half of a bottle of muscle relaxers.  It was recently brought to my attention that Cymbalta causes giant hives and severe vomiting (even after six years). Now I am 5 days off and I feel like electrodes are connected to me, I cannot stop crying, and I have wet my pants two times today but hey I haven’t puked!!!   I guess feeling “normal” just wasn’t in the cards for me because thanks to whomever is to blame I will never take even an aspirin after this! "

At the start of this year along with seeing a therapist I felt I would try to ween myself off them gradually. Initially I felt fine and felt no ill affects. But after a few months and down to 5mg in hindsight I had begun to just muddle through. By the time I was pretty much off them it was the start of a two week holiday from work, which was started off by me having a major panic attack and and a flood of the depression coming back at full force. I was tearful, couldn't sleep or eat. I couldn't see my doctor as it was the weekend so i went to the hospital who in seeing me put me started me back on the same tablets. I then went to see my own doctor on the Monday. In discussion with him, he feels I can't regulate my own serotonin levels and I should stay on the medicines longer. That he understands me trying to come off the medication but if it works for now then why risk coming off. That there are far more toxic medications out there that people have to take for the rest of there life. While I was still just raking 5mg we planned for me to slowly increase my dosage over the next few weeks back up to 20mg. He reluctantly gave me diazepam to help if and when I needed it. I gradually started to feel better over the weeks and returned to work after my holiday. It was only until last week on my second week of 20mg that I then started to spiral back down again. My appetite has gone and I feel terrible. Endless negative thoughts/ panic!! I can't remember if this is normal while the meds get back into your system or if they aren't working.

While titrating I experienced no side effects at all and I felt great! now a week ago I had dropped to a major depressive episode, crying all day long at every little thing and experiencing detachment and suicidal thoughts. I am also bruising all over the place. my anxiety is back to how it had been, keeping me from leaving my house, and even taking a lot for me to write here. I had also started throwing and have diarrhea . now the throwing up could be related to my acid reflux , though I'm on medicine for that and hadn't had a problem until now.. I take Viibryd in the morning with breakfast.  i know that it takes 8 weeks, but I want to stop this now. I have been on the 40 for only a week less than a month .. Viibryd all together almost two months. I know it's not recommended to stop without your doctor but I can't get a hold of mine. I guess because it's the weekend I feel absolutely bottomed out . it's affecting my school , which I take online, and my life in general I am not sure if the bruising is due to the Viibryd but they're random otherwise and have no reason to be there.

Viibryd came up in my GeneSight test as an antidepressant in my “green” column, along with Pristiq, Fetzima, and Emsam.  We chose Viibryd because it is the least expensive of all those recommendations with the manufacturers discount card. Our insurance will not cover any of the meds in my “green “ column.

Major Depressive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/wellbutrin-stablon-substitute-reluctantly-2793195.html,Wellbutrin & Stablon - how to substitute - reluctantly?,"Ha all, I have been taking Wellbutrin (300mg) and Stablon (15mg) for about 12 months now, for depression & anxiety. I had tried a number of SSRI's yet the side effects were too much to bear. The best out of the SSRI's I tried, was Zoloft. I have been living in Asia where both these great non-SSRI meds have been available. For some sad and depression-promoting reasons, I have had to move back to Australia. Unfortunately the Stablon is not available in Australia, and Wellbutrin is only allowed to be prescribed as a treatment for smoking cessation. I am running out of meds and can't get back to Asia to stock up so I am going to need to migrate to other meds. Whilst I have been stable, I am currently in the midst of my worst life crisis ever (my finances were stolen, career affected as a result, no home of my own, relationships affected, all at once) and am therefore prone to sink back into the darkness. I therefore need to make a careful transition to new meds. Given the Australian doctors don't know Stablon, nor are they very experienced in using Wellbutrin for depression, I seek advice from any of you out there who may be able to suggest alternatives. I know this is the domain of a good psychiatrist, however given the lack of use of these meds in Australia, I am a bit worried about the advice I will receive. I am going to at least see a GP today who knows a little bit about my situation already. Any feedback received here will be at least something I can use to cross-check whatever the medical community recommends to me here. I must say that the Wellbutrin and Stablon have been doing a great job, keeping me away from the darkness, given that I have had less stressful phases of life than I have now, and in those cases was really dark. I am enjoying at east some stability during an awful situation; a bit panicky about a forced meds change. Many thanks in advance for any responses; again I acknowledge that such recommendations are the domain of Psych's ... kinda need the brainstorm here though. Regards "

Ways to Avoid Menses?,"Hello all! I have been having some difficulty adjusting to Lamotrigine (off-label for MDD & Anxiety). I had an immediate ++ response that disappeared while still in the 1st introduction phase. Titrating up has been normal (I know not to expect much until I'm at a therapeutic dose). However, I had been at 100mg IR dose and my Doctor and I agreed that it would be good to bump it up again. However, what she did was move me to 100mg ER for 6 weeks, and said that it would be LIKE a bump up because my body would metabolize it differently. Problems: 1. Since switching to the ER, I crashed. My depression & anxiety swallowed me up. Modiness is okay, so that is a continuing improvement, but the desire for isolation, loss of motivation, and overall sad affect have really become noticeable. 2. I am on a birth control pill that is a mix of the one that starts with an E (not estrogen but more synthetic-sounding) and Progesterone. I did some internet research and was uncomfortable to see studies indicating that birth control pills can reduce the levels of L. in the system by as much as 50%. I emailed Doc with this concern, and she said that it might have some effect on the efficacy of the birth control (so I should use a back-up method) but she really didn't see that 50% reduction happening, carry on... blahblah. I don't want to be one of those ""internet patients trying to be doctors,"" yet I'm seeing this mentioned in scientific reports, in forums, and elsewhere. Are these studies so small and insignificant that MDs don't take them seriously? Also, has anyone heard of the LOSS of positive effect when switching from immediate release to XR/ER? For what it's worth, a study I read found that L. serum levels were found to NORMAL for women taking one unique hormone, which is in the brand injectable Depo-Provera. There are pills, Depo, and some kind of sticks that can be implanted in the inner arm that last 3 (4?) years. One final note: I know this sounds really strange, but I take birth control pills not for actual birth control, but to keep from having menses, as that hormonal craziness induces a terrible cystic-type acne. If you know anything on the subject matter that might be helpful, please let me know what other medical options short of hysterectomy there might be to keep menses away. Depo worked like an absolute dream for me for many years of my adult life, yet it leeched calcium from my bones and made them brittle. Thanks, everyone! "

I made a very stupid decision and got pretty drunk about 2 days ago and blacked out for maybe around 6 hours. I woke up feeling worse than your average hangover- extremely depressed, paranoid, anxious, no appetite, and would cry at the drop of a hat. Even now 2 days later I don't feel completely back to myself, I have no energy, but can't sleep.  Drinking until blacking out is of course terrible, and this was a wake up call for me to quit drinking all together and actually take those 'no alcohol' warnings on my medications seriously. I've just started taking Concerta and this is the first time I've drank while taking it so I was wondering if anyone has experienced or heard of having a major depressive crash after mixing it with alcohol. It would be nice to at least be able to identify a reason for why I am feeling so badly. Thanks so much everyone for any advice or comments, I really appreciate it. And do forgive me if this is covered in another question, I tried to look for some answers but couldn't find any, but if there is another discussion about this it would be great if you could direct me to it.

I fought hard to try and get the brand name because I've found I'm very sensitive to antidepressants and all the negative reviews I've read on the generics but my insurance just won't cover it. I've tried Prozac for 10 days and it made me have suicidal thoughts. Lexapro made me have panic attacks and Zoloft increased my anxiety as well. I know you're supposed to try and stick out the side effects but I guess I'm not strong enough to do so because I can't bare them. I'm taking bupropion for anxiety, OCD, depression and binge eating. I'm also on adderall IR 20mg 3x a day. This helps control my urges during the day and suppress my appetite but my body is quite used to it now so the effects have extremely lessened and it also leaves me with a very hard crash at the end of the day with all of my issues back 10x harder ending with a binge regardless of me eating healthy throughout the day. This is why I've been trying antidepressants. Ive also tried Vyvanse for a decent amount of time and it was not helpful in the slightest. I've noticed the bupropion quite literally seems to cancel out the effects of adderall to the point I felt like I didn't take it at all and it's increased my hunger tremendously to the point I can't seem to get full. I've read how this is known to suppress your appetite but I'm wondering if because it's the generic it won't? Or if the first few days you're hungry then it suppresses?

When should it even out?,"Some background info: I'm Canadian, 25 years old, female. Since my late teens when I left home (I had a rough childhood, my father has schizoaffective disorder, which made my life very unstable), I have been suffering from periods of depression that have lasted anywhere from 3 months to a full year. In January 2016 I fell into another depression that wasn't lifting (with the exception of one week in summer) and that was accompanied by a lot of suicidal thoughts, so I finally decided in November that I would seek help. I stated seeing a psychologist and in December my GP diagnosed me with MDD and prescribed Zoloft (starting at 25mg and increasing by 25 mg every 5 days until we hit my current dose of 100 mg), which I started taking December 27th.  Will since then, I feel like I have been on an emotional roller coaster. After the very first dose, I didn't sleep at all for 48 hours, because I was full of energy and giddy. I told my GP this and she told me that it was due to anxiety from starting the medication and reassured me that his was normal, and to stick with it, which is what I did. The third day, I slept around 5 hours, and was still very happy, and didn't need to sleep again for another 2 days after that. I decided that, even though they told me it would take a month to start seeing the effects of the SSRI, it clearly was working well for me, because I was very happy. I was a lot more social, I was spending time in the mall, I read 7 new books and did all of my lesson planning through to the end of February. But then on January 18th I fell into another very deep depression, but this was like an angry depression. I was crying inconsolably, but I had a lot of energy still, and I ended up spending 3 days crying, throwing adult temper tantrums, staying up all night, and self harming, before finally ending up in my psychologists office, exhausted from the three days prior. She was concerned and very supportive, and I began seeing her twice a week after that, which helped somewhat. This very deep depression lasted until February third, when I began feeling happier again. I am now feeling great. I have been losing weight, reading lots of books, going for walks and being more sociable again. I've done lot of shopping, lots of cleaning. I've been feeling so great that I have decided that I should go back to school to pursue an MEd degree. But I can't shake the nagging feeling that this happiness won't last. Are these kinds of mood swings normal when starting an SSRI? If anyone else experienced this, when did things start to even out for you? "

I’ve heard mostly good things about this.  I’ll start off by saying that I’ve been on Zoloft for exactly 3 years, and last spring (2018) I decided to titrate down from my maintanence dose of 150mg, to 100mg, to 75mg, then to 50mg over the course of about 8 months. In mid-December I had a recurrent episode of anxiety and depression and had to go back up to 75mg, which didn’t quite cut it, then back to 100mg, which I believe I have been at now for about 6 weeks. Going back to 100mg (where I was totally good at when I was titrating down) has not quite gotten me back to where I need to be. The doctor diagnosed me as being in partial remission, and that was two weeks ago, I feel better now than I did then. I may also have to give the Zoloft some more time to reach efficacy again. I don’t want to go higher than 100mg again because the reason I starting titrating down was to lose weight. Weigh gain was the only long term side effect suffered, thank God. Other than that, Zoloft has been great. But again, I’m not where I need to be yet.  Today the doctor prescribed 150mg of Wellbutrin XL to augment the Zoloft, and I’m starting that in the morning when I wake up. This is so I can maybe come off the Zoloft in the future, or greatly reduce it at least, and to counteract that weight gain side effect. I’ve heard that these two drugs play well together and that Wellbutrin can help Zoloft (and other SSRIs) do its job better. Does anyone have any insight on this and can anyone give me an idea of what to expect? I appreciate it. "

Some advice would be appreciated!?","I have been on sertraline HCL for almost exactly 3 years. I went on it because I had a really hard time coming home from college and my family life being all screwy, etc. Also depression and anxiety runs in my family, my grandmother has had it and my mother has had it situationally... I have to say that sertraline as well as cognitive behavioral therapy/talk therapy changed my life. I quit drinking entirely, got stronger, and am overall much better off. By the way, I eventually titrated up to 150mg and held there.  Last March I was having weight troubles and spoke with my doctor about it and he suggested it was because of the sertraline. Since I was feeling really well I decided that his suggestion to lower my dose was a good one, so I did. I did 2 weeks at 125, then down to 100mg where I stayed for about 4-5 months, then I went to 75mg where I stayed for 3 months. By this time I had cut the dose in half and was doing really well. In early October I decided to go down to 50mg... here’s where things got hairy. I was fine at first, but about 4 weeks in I was having weird emotional symptoms and other symptoms of fatigue and general malaise off and on, basically all symptoms of sertraline withdrawal. About 8 weeks (around December 10th) in I crashed... crazy withdrawal symptoms. Major anxiety, some depression, stomach all chewed up and nervous all the time, no appetite, just bad. So basically it would appear I went down too fast... as the jumps downward got bigger I should have gone in smaller increments and slower (let me know if anyone agrees/disagrees with that)...  So in mid December I went back up to 75mg at the recommendation of my therapist and my doctor. Within a few days I felt a lot better (another sign I was withdrawing). However I was still not feeling great after 3 weeks... strange thoughts and cravings of alcohol for some reason, some depression, still some stomach issues, etc. So this past Friday Jan. 4th (10 days ago) I decided to bump back up to 100mg at the recommendation of my doctor. I thought it was a good idea. I’ve got a lot coming up in my life and my head has to be right. In the first few days I felt a bit better, but then my side effects got bad... bouts of anxiety, depression, appetite coming and going, strange unwanted thoughts (some of suicidal ideation, however I have no desire to die, I want to be happy and healthy), loose stools (I haven’t had a solid bowel movement in a month), malaise, fatigue, not interested in the world around me, inside my head a lot, etc...  Now, so seem to remember much of this from when I was first titrating up 3 years ago, but for some reason it’s still scaring me. The question is: if Zoloft worked before, will I get back to where I was? Will I be OK? I don’t want to have to switch medicines or screw with this much longer... this past month has been really hard. I’ve only been back on 100mg for about 10 days. Even though the drug has been in my system for a long time, does it still stand to reason that I need to adjust to going back up and that I’ll level out in the next couple weeks or so? I’ve heard that even though the drug is in my system already it’ll still take 2-3 weeks for a dosage increase to work.  Hopefully this wasn’t too long winded. Any advice would be much appreciated. "

So question part one is: would it be alright to not go up to the 40mg of Viibryd? I am on the starter pack that has the 10/20/40 dosage for the first 3 weeks. Currently on day 11. I go back to my PCP in 10 days. Can I just take the last 3 20mg doses and then go back to the 10mgs so that I'm weened off as much as possible when I go back to my Dr? That's about what my Dr would tell me to do anyway isn't it? I hate this med and any more of it would make me house bound due to stomach issues. Not working is not a great option for me right now.  Pat 2: I want to go back on the Zoloft because I feel like it did the most good. This sounds weird, but whenever I get frustrated with the Viibryd side affects I start thinking ""I want my Z back"". Another wrinkle in this tale is that I started feeling like the Zoloft stopped working almost exactly when I had PMS. My cycle is irregular (not on hormonal BC either), and I wasn't paying much attention to the timing of my mood changes so I didn't realize this. In fact, I didn't notice it first-a friend did after looking at my health notes that I keep daily in an app on my phone. Now I'm wondering if I overreacted. I want to try the Zoloft again for a longer period of time (2-3 months at least) on a steady dose. In hindsight, it really did help considerably and I think I have better expectations of what to expect from a medication (ie, there will be bad days that meds can't prevent). Does this sound reasonable? Has anyone else been through something like this? On the flip side of my thinking, I worry that I just want this awful phase of trial and error to be over and I'm compromising. And that I'm over thinking this. Any advise or shared experiences would be helpful. Thank you all. "

It has been a very effective combination for me, which I am extremely grateful for. I was struggling to find medications that helped me live a productive life for ten years, and covered most classes of anti-depressants before ending up on Wellbutrin. I was prescribed this combo about four years ago, and I haven't had a true clinical episode of depression or hypomania since. I'm a US/UK dual citizen, and was planning to ask for a transfer at my company to their London branch, because I've wanted to move to London for a very long time. (Please forget about Brexit making this a bad choice when answering- I'm really just concerned about my medication first and foremost before worrying about that.) So it was a pretty nasty shock to look up Wellbutrin in the UK and find that it's not approved for depression over there. Bupropion is prescribed for smoking cessation, but not depression. Is there any way that I could still have access to it after moving? Would a doctor make an exception to prescribe it to me if I've already been taking it for four years and clearly haven't been abusing it? Or could I continue to be a patient to my American doctor and have it shipped to me without running into any issues? Cost is less of a concern, and I don't mind if the NHS doesn't cover it or I can't use American insurance. Unfortunately, I just don't think the process of finding other medications all over again is worth it for me, and I've basically already tried most of them.

My depression began as post-pardum and then I left my now ex-husband and I suffered from depression horribly through this time. I reached a point where I was taking Viibryd 40 mg, 300 Welbutrin XR and then was put on Abilfy. At that time I decided this was insane and I wanted to get off of everything and start fresh to see if something else would help me without needing 3 pills a day.

I have been researching and Viibryd appears to be one that doesn't cause tiredness, although I read mixed reviews on this. Would the Wellbutrin nullify the tires/lazy feeling of an SSRI? I always give up but can't this time so I need the right combo. I really don't want to mix but I read a lot on here and I'll try it. Any thoughts on the right SSRI combo with Wellbutrin. Thanks "

I was curious whether anyone has had similar experiences to me. I have taken fluoxetine for 5 years. When I first started taking it, I couldn't believe the change that happened in me. I was like a new person essentially overnight, the effect was that pronounced. This effect has not gone away. However, as the years have worn on I have gotten more and more tired all the time, to the point that while I'm not depressed, I am too tired to take part in a lot of social events or really give myself 100% to any endeavour. I want to have the continued effect of fluoxetine but without this grinding exhaustion. What should I do? I take bupropion alongside fluoxetine but it doesn't make much difference in terms of the exhaustion. i was thinking of going off the fluoxetine and only staying on the bupropion, but I'm aware that it works in an entirely different way to SSRIs (dopamine vs serotonin), so maybe it would be a bad idea given that regulating serotonin uptake clearly helps?

My doctor had also prescribed Buspirone HCL 15 mg and as of early November I'm now taking that twice daily. I still feel I'm struggling with depression and anxiety and not sure if these higher doses are actually helping or if I should ask for higher doses to see if that would make a difference? I'm a bit intimidated because my psychiatrist seems very conservative in upping the doses and prior to the sertraline change to 150 mg she said she wasn't sure what to do next if that didn't help me. I'm wondering if the 2 meds I'm taking are considered ""higher than the norm""? In speaking with my therapist several months ago I had said I wasn't sure that the meds in these doses were going to be upped by the doctor. She did encourage me to ask the doctor but that in her opinion this dr tends to be very conservative in what she prescribes and I may need to ask to switch to another psychiatrist in the practice. I guess in scared the dr will think I need inpatient care if I cannot make due with my current med doses. Are these two meds at these doses considered really high? I had a similar bad experience when I was seeing a new family doctor and asked her to prescribe an alternative to Cymbalta. She said she had lots of options to find a new med for me, as that one was no longer working. In the end she had me try just two different meds at the lowest dose, and I slowly was able to increase the dose over multiple weeks at a time but neither had a positive affect for me. At that point she told me I'd need to find a psychiatrist because ""she couldn't help me"". It made me feel awful and like I was some kind of freak. Thank you "

I felt like I could run a marathon yet at the same time I couldn’t even stand up straight without leaning over from exhaustion. During the day I was very drowsy/anxious and at one point during driving I started to see lights/colors and my vision went spotty. Now I’m not sure if that was the medication or me just actually panicking. So I stopped taking it after that. I only took the 1 pill and freaked out because I have never taken antidepressants before.

I know that’s its only one dose, but I am a very nervous person and I don’t like not feeling in control of myself. I never drink or do any drugs because of this reason. But with Effexor I feel like i don’t know what’s going to happen and that’s scaring me so I just want it out of my system as soon as possible. I am also nervous about taking this because I was prescribed the lowest possible dose of birth control and it made me extremely extremely sick for 2 months and the only reason I started taking the antidepressants was because I was told I couldn’t take any type of birth control without them.

I have been been diagnosed again with the same disorders 3 times since then. I'm 29 now.

I had been on 300 mg Wellbutrin for the past couple of years with no side effects, but I started having a lot of side effects at the higher dosage.

While I will say that this drug helped me out early on, I have felt it hasn't worked for me for YEARS. Which is why I wanted to come off. I have been asking my psych nurse practitioner of 8 years to take me off this stuff for over a year, but she would not agree. I have suffered from major depression and anger for the majority of my life, and while I understand her concerns, I have always felt it is MY decision to stop taking this drug. I recently changed my job, insurance company, and thus providers and my new Psychiatrist agreed to help me come off the venlafaxine. I weaned from 75 mg to 37.5 mg, spent a month on the 37.5 mg, and came off completely 2 days ago. I knew there were going to be withdrawal symptoms. Today I am dizzy and have diarrhea, but that's about it so far. It is amazing to me that there is so little information available from healthcare professionals or the drug company on the withdrawal symptoms of this drug. With the exception of one small blurb on the drug company's web site, all other information I have found has been on forums where actual people using this stuff have shared their withdrawal journey. I am hoping to find myself again without this drug masking who I really am. I have been through a tremendous amount of change in the last 6 years and I want to be myself again and see who that turns out to be, without the meds. My main goal today was to find out if there is any data about the timeline of the withdrawal symptoms or coping suggestions or supplements from any healthcare professional source. I haven't found any yet and I'm about an hour in to my online search. If anyone out here knows of any forum or website specifically by the medical community on how to manage the withdrawals from venlafaxine, I would greatly appreciate hearing about it. Thanks!! "

After 3.5 years on citalopram, after what I can only describe as a ‘breakdown’, I was advised to swap from 30mg of citalopram to 10mg of escitalopram (this after 6 weeks of no change to my symptoms) I have now been on the new medication for 19 days.  I had a good first week when I felt almost normal for a number of days (placebo effect?) but have suffered mood swings for the last 10 days, including irritability and suicidal thoughts, increased sleep and inability to get out of bed in the morning, tinnitus, diarrhoea, stomach cramps, dry mouth and anxiety.  I had high hopes for the new medication and have seen short bursts of increased motivation, but nothing lasting.  My doctor told me I should start to feel better after one to two weeks. I want to carry on with the new drug, but I remain unable to work.

I switched for another AD in February because it seemed to not work anymore (I was very anxious) and I suffered like hell from indigestion, nausea, night sweats... And they all went away when my GP put me back on Amitriptyline, 75mg, mid-March. My severe anxiety also crept its way back. By mid-April, I started to belch a little more than usual and several day later I was suffering from indigestion again. My GP put me on Zoloft in addition to Amitriptyline. 100mg for the first week: hell. Just literally hell. Acid reflux as soon as 2mn after my first pill. It seems to be better when taken with food. 150mg for the second week: Indigestion got better to the point that it doesn't make much sense anymore (symptoms keep on switching). I still belch, although a bit less I think...  Buuut when I started 150mg, something else appeared: a big painful lump in my throat. Food stuck on it. I had a hard time swallowing past it. The lump did get worse when I was more anxious about it. It eventually went away and now I'm left with a very tight throat. I choke on bread or pasta. It gets stuck in the bottom of my throat and behind my chest. I feel my oesophagus cramping, and even my stomach. I am terribly, horribly frightened. I don't know if it's a common issue with the drug, or my anxiety (which is still at its worst) or an escalation of my indigestion/belching, i.e. oesophagus cancer. No amount of anxiolytic calms me down. Nothing works. I'm dead sure I'm going to die (pun intended). Is reflux or choking on food something from Zoloft or should I write my will? "
Major Depressive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/zoloft-anyone-noticed-feel-after-decreasing-dose-3401919.html,Zoloft - Has anyone noticed that they feel better after decreasing dose?,"I have been taking Zoloft for a couple of years now, and am very happy with it. Zoloft, in combination with some other medications, works well for me. For the last year or so, my dose has been 150mg. Recently I ran out of my 50mg capsules and, even though I did get them refilled in time, I had forgotten to add the 50s to my pill holder for the rest of the week (Wednesday-Saturday). So, basically, I have only been on 100mg for about 4 days now. Oddly enough, I have noticed that I have been feeling better. I feel more like myself. Before, for example, I would hear a song that I liked on the radio and it was as if there was a part of me deep down that wanted to dance and sing along to it like I used to do before I started taking meds, but I just couldn't. My symptoms were well controlled, but looking back on it I have felt very ""flat"" for quite a while now. Since being down from 150mg to 100mg, however, I feel like I have gotten my joy and zest for life back. Could it be that my dose was too high? Has anyone else experienced this? I mean, I still had feelings and cared about everything as I always have, but it felt almost muted I guess would be the best way to describe it. Today I felt that spark within me again that I thought I had lost forever. I don't know; maybe it has nothing to do with the dose decrease. Maybe it's just that the weather is getting better here lately. But I thought it was very interesting, and that maybe I should ask the group what your thoughts are, and if this has happened to anyone else.  Thanks so much! ~CareBear34 "

Major Depressive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/long-term-zoloft-side-effects-3249178.html,Long term Zoloft side effects?,"So I have been on Zoloft for 10 years now (I started at 9 y/o and am now 19) and it has worked great in treating my severe anxiety disorder. However, I have been taking an exceptionally high dosage for the past 7 years (200mg daily), which apparently increases possible side effects. The thing is that since I have been taking it for so long and I was so young when I started, I have no idea what aspects of my behavior or body functions are the meds or what are just me. I met with my new ""adult"" doctor last week for the first time and he told me I need to lose weight. I told him I know but I honestly don't know how to or how I keep gaining weight so consistently (I'm not huge, but I am decently chubby). I don't eat much regularly seeing as another medication I take (and have been taking for almost as long) destroys my appetite. He looked at the meds I'm taking and realized it must be from the Zoloft. I said I thought it wasn't considered a weight gain drug. He explained it typically isn't but since most people take 25mg - 100mg, taking 200mg could cause weight gain. So he suggested I try a new drug. This made me nervous because it took forever to find the right medication and dosage that worked, and I prefer being able to function as a normal adult and have an actual life. I'm still nervous, but we decided on Pristiq, a drug a previous psychiatrist recommended if I ever did want to try something else. I start weening off Zoloft and incrementing Pristiq in a month and a half, and I'm nervous. I have no idea what it will change, if it will work, and what it could possibly screw up. I'm curious if anyone here has  1) Taken Zoloft long term and/or in larger dosages that know more about the side effects 2) Taken Pristiq that could tell me how it worked for them/what side effects they experienced  I'm nervous and excited and desperate to know a little bit more about what could happen moving forward.

Major Depressive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/clonazepam-bupropion-anger-mood-swings-2683926.html,"Clonazepam and Bupropion, anger and mood swings?","I've been on bupropion XL 300 mg for roughly two years now, when I was put on it I'd been having ha difficult time with my moods often feeling depressed, and crying over stupid things that shouldn't have frustrated me. It worked rather well for me, up until recently. February 27th I was put on clonazepam 0.5 mg for anxiety/panic episodes. I'd say I started noticing the increase in nerves around last December, and first sought ways to cope with it by finding things to calm me down when I started to feel anxious or panicked about something. It finally hit a point where my panic would either throw me into a frustrated rampage on myself, that went on and on in a vicious cycle of being mad at myself for not being able to handle something that doesn't make anyone else nervous. On occasion I even snapped at my roommates. Sometimes my defense for the panic was to get angry, when really I was downright scared of looking like an idiot, or failing at something, or just overthinking everything. Othertimes, I'd crumple into this hyperventilating sobbing scared mess. It was all 50/50 and unpredictable how I'd react. A lot of the time it depended on who I was around. I would have these episodes, and then once they were over I felt raw, empty, like I'd shut down entirely to the world around me, sometimes for a few hours, sometimes for a few days. When starting clonazepam it knocked me out, and about two days being on it I was feeling lots better! Relived, and not frantically worrying about little things, and happy again, and feeling that made me absolutely estatic! Not so much anymore. Thursday March 5th I had a mini episode, and it was in public, at school, on a little ""field trip"" deal (career college, not high school). I started to feel nervous when we had to put on hair coveres and face masks to go into the back. I got left behind becaise I was having issues with the hair net, I asked for help, got none. And they left me. It took so much for me not to panic and cry, I could feel the hyperventilation getting ready. Even explains this makes me re-feel what I felt. I didn't know what I was doing, it was like I forgot how to gown up. The rest of the tour was a blur, I was dealing with trying to keep my cool the entire time, and my teacher shadowed me the entire time asking if I was ok. That alone made it harder for me to chill out. Since then I've had mood swings like a freaking banshee! Times where I feel excited and estatic, but then get real emotional and want to cry, or angry and punch walls or flip tables. Then I numb out, loose all interest in anything. Still being new to the combination is it just me adjusting and will I even out and just be good for once? Or is the dose too low? 1/2 of a 0.5 does absolutely nothing for me. This weekend in particular has been hard, very very hard since Thursday, and I'm at a crossroads right now of feeling numb and wanting to cry, but in me too, when roughy 1 1/2 hours ago I was so irate about a situation I couldn't focus on anything. I'd call my dr. But it's Sunday, and I don't want to do anything like take one more clonazepam without his ok first. He did say we would start at 0.5 mg first by either splitting it, or taking it whole, and then decide to either up the dose, or do something else. I'd like to note that the emotional instability has occurred to me before back when I was put on bupropion XL 150 mg, made me a crazy unstable mess worse than I was before, and the. The dosage was upped to 300 mg and I was a happy camper. Has anyone had any similar experiences as far as mood swings on either of these prescriptions, preferably a combination of the two?

For my depression, it has worked wonders. I haven't noticed any negative side effects and am very happy for the results I have noticed. However, a few years ago my psychiatrist decided that anxiety was also something that I needed to treat. I started lexapro, and although it seemed to work fine, I felt sluggish and was gaining weight and my sex drive was gone. After lowering the dosage so low, we finally decided it was best to change the drug. I am now on Wellbutrin SR and recently started Buspirone HCL 7.5 that I take once a day. It was fine at first, but yesterday I started having headaches and while those are bearable, today I just feel terrible. I'm emotional, I take another dose of headache meds every 6 hours, I feel sluggish, and I'm afraid this might not be the drug for me. I know headaches are a side effect but I didn't read anything about being sad or feeling so lazy. I am not drinking alcohol or doing anything else while taking these meds. Could it possibly be the dosage of one or the other? Just debating if I need to reach out to my doctor or see if it gets better in the next couple of days. "

I had two episodes of depression/anxiety in my late 30s and early 40s Zoloft worked wonders. After the last one, I decided to stay on zoloft at a small dose - 25 mG. to help prevent any relapse. It was my wonder drug (did therapy too).  About six weeks ago, i started having bad insomnia, and bad anxiety and now depression. After upping my zoloft with no relief (in fact made it worse), I went to a psych appt and she is gradually switching my to Prozac. I took my first 10 mg pill today, and tapering off zoloft - 25 a day. I'm also on .25 of Xanax 3X a day for anxiety. (we will wean off once the prozac kicks in) I was shocked to learn I had lost 10 lbs in a month and wasn't trying. Its just hard to eat.  My main anxiety is sleep, when I don't sleep, I feel that I can't cope. Its a vicious cycle. And I'm reading that prozac gives you insomnia. And i am struggling in a big way with insomnia.  I guess I just need some reassurance. I'm hopeful, but scared. The insomnia seems like a big side effect. Of course worrying about it makes it worse, I know. Anyone have any good stories about making this switch? Does it make sense that zoloft would just stop working after a decade (ish).  I'm not in menopause (had that checked) but I am certainly close at 49. Can your brain chemistry change during this type of adjustment?  Sorry for the rambling, you guys.

After just two days of taking it, I actually started feeling better! (Less anxiety, less self-defeating thoughts, more calm overall, etc.)  The problem is that even before taking Lexapro, I’ve been suffering from severe insomnia for the past few days (could literally sleep only 2 hours a night - probably induced by depression/anxiety/stress), and I saw that one of the side effects of lexapro is insomnia... Well, as you may have guessed, taking Lexapro for 2 days didn’t improve my insomnia at all, as I got only around 2 hours of sleep again... at this point, I am just DESPERATE to get a decent number of hours of sleep. I took melatonin tablet 3mg before sleeping last night as well, but that didn’t do anything. I’m convinced that maybe 10 mg of lexapro is too much for my insomnia, so just this morning (3rd day on Lexapro), I cut the 10mg in half and took 5mg orally and am planning on doing so every day to see if that will affect my insomnia in any way... is this okay to do without consulting my GP?

I was told I would not feel hungry and would have to force myself to eat. This has not been the case. While my appetite has decreased somewhat I still feel hungry especially in the evening hours. I am up to the max dosage for these meds and considering asking to be removed from them. I take several BP meds which have been reviewed prior to start of the program. Do you think the meds might have something to do with it?? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks DS Englewood fla 
Major Depressive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/prozac-work-1044641.html,How well does Prozac ACTUALLY work?,"Hey, I'm Maxine. I'm always angry and depressed. I've been told by multiple doctors that no-one should be as depressed as I am, ALL the time. I recently turned 14 years old on January 28th. I started out with Zoloft 10mg, it didn't seem to work, gradually over the year I was eventually was bumped up to 100mg. I found it made a difference in my behavior especially with sleeping, eating, etc. Well it was such a high dosage I thought I'm just having some side affects and it'll work! Sure enough it did, later on through the months I began to experience what doctors call, 'the Honey Moon phase'. I will explain for those who may not know what it is- the honey moon phase is where the pill is helping for awhile, but then you start to notice it not really helping. (Sorry that it's not the best explanation.) After that, my doctor instantly put me on 50mg of Pristiq(which I believe is only Canadian.) It didn't phase me at all. I was so angry. My mother says there is no magic pill, I have to work at it too. But as victims of Depression, we all know that is very well easier said than done. Recently he sent me to a Psychiatrist, I found out I have Childhood and Paranoid Schizophrenia, which certainly does not help my situation, as you can see. Anyways, he prescribed me Prozac. I haven't started it yet, I am instructed to wait a week so I can ween off Pristiq. I also have trouble sleeping, which makes me more depressed since I'm left alone with my thoughts. As a victim of Childhood and Paranoid Schizophrenia- it is hard to stick with one thought. So, I end up thinking about many depressing things at once. For example: I haven't been to school in 34 days, my only job is to attend school (8th grade) and I can't even do that. Why am I such a failure? Or, Why can't I make people happy, why are they also angry or disappointed with me. Stuff like that. Another thing that makes it worse- I can't stand living in my own skin. I'm never gonna be a skinny little twig like most girls, I'm a curvy young lady, it's how I'm built I can't change that, but because I'm depressed I eat more than I should. I'm currently 35 pounds, roughly, over the ""normal"" weight suggestion for a girl my age. I guess thats enough about my life x3 I just wanted to let you guys know my story so you'd be able to tell me with the amount of Depression, Anxiety, I have, you could tell me how Prozac would effect me. I'm hoping it will work because I can't handle this anymore. I'm on the verge of breaking down again. I recently cut myself multiple times on my wrist with my mothers razor blade I had stolen from her sewing kit monthhhhhsssssssssssssssssssss ago. I'm ashamed but I needed to know that I was still alive, still bleeding. I've felt so numb. Please share your expierences with Prozac and how it may have helped you. I just want an idea. I know it's unusual for a girl my age to be prescribed a medication meant for adults, but please try to give me the best examples of how it has helped you. Anyways, I apologize for the novel I just made you read. Have a wonderful weekend. - Maxine. "

I cannot take topomax and last time I talked to my neurologist she said that every other preventative migraine medication can cause weight gain.

Actually at that time she prescribed nortriptyline which was supposed to, according to her, have the least risk of weight gain. I gained about 20lbs and it didn't help with my migraines at all either. A little background on me and migraines: I've been getting chronic migraines since I was about 10 years old. I've tried a variety of medications for it. For a long time I was on hormonal birth control continuously and that helped a lot since hormone changes seem to trigger migraines for me. But over a year ago I had to stop hbc. When I was first diagnosed with migraines a doctor prescribed zoloft as a preventative. I don't remember that helping though. I've also tried topamax, which didn't help, had terrible side effects (and now, according to my neurologist, I couldn't take also due to my history of kidney stones.) I currently take nadolol as a preventative, which was somewhat effective when I started it, but my migraines are getting more frequent again despite it. Obviously I have also tried nortriptyline. For abortive meds I've treid everything OTC and imitrex. Currently taking maxalt + an OTC painkiller which is fairly effective the only big problem is my insurance doesn't cover enough pills of that or how frequent my migraines have been.

Muscle Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/tramadol-ultram-50mg-suddenly-stopped-having-any-444257.html,Tramadol (Ultram) 50mg suddenly stopped having any effect?,"My Dr. recently prescribed me Tramadol (Ultram) 50mg 1 - 2 up to 4x a day to help manage chronic pain as a result of nerve and muscle trauma. I was previously on Co-codamol 30/500 (Codeine/Paracetamol(acetaminophen)) 2x every 4 hours for almost a year, but due to a tolerence build up they were offering little to no pain relief thus the change in pain medication. When I first took 50mg of Tramadol it had no effect, 4 hours later I took another 50mg and I was hit pretty hard, harder than the Co-codamol ever did. The Tramadol carried on being excellent pain relief for a week at no more than 200mg a day. I woke up one morning this week in quite a lot of pain so I took 100mg of Tramadol and tried to get on with my daily tasks. I realised after an hour (When the Tramadol would usually kick in) I was getting no relief. I tried to carry on with my daily tasks in hope that it would eventually start to help but nothing happened. I managed to get a power nap in then woke up just in time to be able to take another dose of Tramadol, but the same result of no pain relief persisted. Since then I have been in agony and my Dr. refuses to prescribe me anything stronger because of the increased risk of addiction. I tried to argue that I had been on Codeine for almost a year and with frequent check ups with the nurse, I presented no addictive traits that showed cause for concern. Being a resident of the UK it is very hard to even get opiate based pain medication in the first place as they are strictly controlled. It was only after months of being prescribed mediocre medications such as diclofenac, that to be frank, were no stronger than the OTC (Over The Counter) medicines, that I was able to start a course of Co-codamol. I imagine after reading this long post many of you have become bored but I applaud and thank those who continue to read through. The reason I'm posting is to gather as much information as I can as to why the Tramadol (Ultram) would suddenly stop having any effect. I mean zero effect what so ever appart from insomnia which is only remedied by pretty strong sedatives or relaxants I have left over from previous prescriptions. I read Tramadol has a pretty long half-life (duration of effect) so despite being in pain I waited as long as possible between doses. When I spoke to my Dr. about the Tramadol no longer working he said if I was intolerant to the Tramadol it wouldn't have had any positive effects only adverse ones such as allergic reactions. It felt like he was suspicious of me or that he was pushing the blame to me as if it was something that I must have done in order for the medication to suddenly stop working which I wasn't very happy about. He insisted Tramadol is a potent painkiller and that I should continue to use it despite my complaint. Since the visit to him a few days ago I have been using Diazepam (Valium) from a previous prescription for its muscle relaxant properties which have helped ease the pain a little but the strong sedative effect it has on me is preventing me from doing even some of the simplest every day tasks. I hope I have been thorough enough with my recent situation in order to get a detailed response to why Tramadol (Ultram) would suddenly stop working. Just to cover any posts that consist of ""search google"", I have with numerous search terms but they all lead to websites that advise you not to suddenly stop taking Tramadol (Ultram), which isn't my case. I would like to thank all who have taken their time to fully read my post and to further thank those that can offer positive input into my situation. "

Obesity,https://www.drugs.com/answers/abilify-weight-gain-816225.html,Why exactly does Abilify cause weight gain?,"I'll try to keep this brief. I'm a male model, 29 years old and I just signed with an incredible agency, so weight gain is not an option for me...  I recently started Abilify for treatment resistant depression (1mg a day because 2mg gave me panic attacks, so my pdoc advised I just split the pills in half, which dramatically relieved the issue) and as far as my depression goes, it's been a godsend! There are definitely side effects (irritability, anxiety, restlessness) but those are not my top concerns at this point. Right now, it's the frickin weight gain! Now, my appetite has dramatically increased and it seems insatiable (no matter what I eat, I'm never satisfied, I keep craving something else, I feel like I'm a pregnant woman). But is that the reason for the weight gain? Or is it something in the medicine itself that causes it, regardless of what you eat? P.s. You should also know, I follow a strict diet and workout regimen: -5 to 6 days a week of lifting -4 to 5 days of cardio (20 minutes or 5 miles on the treadmill... depending on my motivation) -And as far as my diet, it's high protein (lean meats), raw fruits and veggies, egg whites(no yolks), low carbs, no butters or oils and no soda So please can someone put my mind at ease, so I can move forward with my career and stop obsessing about this!?

Major Depressive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/lyrica-anti-depressant-effect-2816910.html,Does Lyrica have an anti-depressant effect?,"I have both type-2 bipolar disorder and fibromyalgia. My bipolar control has been iffy the last year and a half. My MPH is reluctant to play with SSNRIs anymore since I'm on 100 mg of Pristiq -- too worried about serotonin syndrome.  Late last year, my PCP decided fibromyalgia was playing an adverse role in my mental health issues. She Rx'd Lyrica, and the results were nothing short of amazing. Within days I free of achy muscles for the first time in years. My energy level shot up, and I was living quite comfortably North of the Equator. Unless you've spent time in the Wicked Witch of the South's lair, you can't appreciate how awesome it is to live somewhere north of the equator. I actually felt hypomanic for a time, but it receded, and honestly? I'd live in Hypomania-ville for the rest of my life if I could. But the area about 10 degrees north of the Equator is a fine neighborhood. Lyrica is expensive even with insurance. A month and a half ago, I knew I was going to run out a few days before I had to money to refill the Rx. By the second missed dose, I crashed hard and deep, down to the cold, dark crypt where the Banshees cry and promise an end to the pain. I had to miss work two days because I couldn't get out of bed. My wife, who is, like me, a nurse, was quite alarmed. When I got paid, I was able to refill the Lyrica.  I woke up the next day after restarting raring to go. I felt refreshed, and ever since, I've been full of energy, motivated to do things, looking forward to things. I do not ever want to run out of Lyrica. Now my question is, does Lyrica have an antidepressant or mood-stabilizing effect? I know it's related to Gabapentin (which I was once on as a mood-stabilizer -- didn't work, made me uber sleepy.) Or is it a simple case of getting my pain under control gave me my life back, which in turn coincidentally lifted me above the Equator? I'm really curious about this. I'm not above reading the PDR when I'm given a new med, but so far, the only psych use for Lyrica I've come across is Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I'd love some feedback on this. Thanks! "

Major Depressive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/zoloft-wellbutrin-work-together-3252881.html,Do Zoloft and Wellbutrin work well together?,"I have MDD, GAD and C-PTSD. I am in the middle of a depressive episode, and also in the midst of changing meds. I was taking Effexor XR 75mg and Wellbutrin XL 300mg for a while, but discontinued the Effexor because of side effects ( I weaned off as per my psychiatrist's recommendations). After about a month of terrible withdrawal from the Effexor, I am taking Zoloft along with the Wellbutrin. I was at 25mg for a week and went up to 50mg on April 7th. I've had a couple of really bad days; lots of crying and wanting to die. I was on Zoloft with Wellbutrin before, and only went off then because my GP wanted to try something out on me. So now I'm trying the combo again. Has anyone found Wellbutrin and Zoloft to be a good combination? I am also taking Seroquel 25mg for sleep. My psychiatrist says I'm ""covered for depression"" with the Wellbutrin, but I am in a depressive episode right now so that can't be true. It's so hard to find the right drug combination! I know you have to give it time, but in the past when I've started a new drug I've usually felt better within a couple of days. Really struggling right now.

Here is some of my background: I was originally placed on Lexapro in Nov. 2006 after a bad bought of anxiety attacks which led to IBS symptoms and GERD. In Aug 2010 I decided to ween off the Lexapro after gaining about 60lbs, I thought my life was stable enough that I could handle the occasional panic attacks without too much trouble. By Dec 2010 I was a complete wreck, upset stomach, unable to eat, easily full after only a few bites of food, stomach discomfort, acid reflux, anxiety daily, worrying over minute things. I withdrew from my spring semester of college (I was set to graduate in May), and I've had to minimize my community involvement. Worse yet, when my children (ages 5, and 6) headed back to school I found that I had terrible panic attacks while driving them to school - so I stopped driving all together. I told my doctor that I needed some sort of medication because I cannot go on living in my room, I have to be able to participate in my childrens lives and take care of them. My doctor choose not to put me back on Lexapro because of the weight gain; instead the doctor first put me on Buspar, then Zoloft, and now I've been on Effexor for four weeks. My stomach muscle is more relaxed and I've been put on Protonix for the GERD. I am eating better but still have signs of IBS and GERD. I wanted to wait out the Effexor and see if things would get better, and they have improved slightly - I am no longer worried about the smallest things, however I am still not able to participate in the life I was living while on the Lexapro. After four weeks on the Effexor I am still unable to drive, and I have to convince myself to leave the house even to go to the doctors office. This 'mind over matter' convincing can take me 40 minutes before leaving the house. I KNOW this is not normal, I've never been like this before. I get uncomfortable with just the thought of entering a grocery store, and heaven forbid I have to get a prescription filled. This is all new to me, I used to love shopping and taking my kids to the park... now it's all I can do to walk to the mail box. I was hoping that after the designated time on the Effexor that I would be feeling better - or atleast better than I am feeling. This makes me wonder if perhaps this is the wrong drug for me. Should it be taking this long? I asked the doctor about it and she said, ""Well we've tried alot of medications, and none of them seem to work."" So she recommended that I see a counselor (which I am going to on Feb. 10th) but I still can't help thinking that I need a stronger medication or a different one. How much longer should I wait? "

It's helped with my attention span, motivation and focus and as an added bonus my social anxiety too. On the other hand it wears off and I still feel like I deal with depression and anxiety and have now for years when I'm honest with myself. I am wondering if maybe Effexor could help me but I've read you can't take the two together. So I'm a little afraid to give up the Adderall. Hence the subject of this post.  Some background on me. My depression started about 10 years ago. I'm 36. At 26 I was diagnosed with IBS. At 28 started developing problems with anxiety and was put on Paxil. I completely lost my sex drive and I gained 25lbs in 4 months. The rapid weight gain made me feel worse, so I stopped it and was now afraid to take any antidepressants. Shortly after I started having insomnia, which eventually turned into unrestorative sleep. In other words 10 hours felt like 2 hours of sleep. Every morning I was exhausted. At 31, I was diagnosed with stage 3 endometriosis and had surgery to remove it along with 3 large fibroids. Felt a little better, lost 10lbs but my anxiety just continued to get worse. I started to experience joint and muscular pain ( mainly in my upper back and shoulders.) At 33 I got pregnant with twins and overall my mood and anxiety improved quite a bit with the pregnancy. I was not in as much pain physically either but still had unrestorative sleep.  Less than a month after giving birth, I totally crashed. First I rapidly lost all my pregnancy weight plus 10lbs more in less then 2 months. I was as thin as I was in my early 20's (I'm actually not complaining about that part.) My joints were stiff and achey and every muscle in my body hurt. I was so tired I could hardly function. After a routine checkup, my bloodwork came back positive for Mono. Mono at 35? (and taking care of newborn twins.) I was sorta shocked. My doctor said it would take a month or two to recover. But I never did. Worse I became this super irritable person and experienced these intense emotional outbursts. I was always a little moody but I almost felt out of control now. I wasn't really weepy but I felt depressed and super angry My whole life had changed and I was not dealing well at all with it. Worse I felt intense guilt, sadness and shame over these feelings. Wasn't I supposed to be happy? Although I loved my girls intensely, I felt so alone. My girls also had colic so they cried 24/7 for almost 5 months, it was a very difficult experience. It actually took me over 6 months and therapy to realize and admit I had postpartum depression. Therapy helped a lot and soon it was like a fog lifting. I began to mentally feel less angry and the outbursts stopped completely but I could not shake this melancholy. Physically though things never improved and this winter I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, Adult ADD and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I see a therapist who specializes in treating people with Chronic pain conditions. Some days are worse then others but I am always in pain. My anxiety especially socially got worse, which made me feel even more isolated, insecure and depressed. Savella has done nothing for me, Adderall at least gives me energy, helps with the brain fog and my concentration and even the pain a little. Surprisingly to me it also helps with my social anxiety too. But I'm ready to deal head on with my depression and anxiety. Hey if I am going to be in constant pain I might as well be semi-happy if I can. My girls deserve a happy mom. "

I'm on Sertraline and would like some advice!?,"This website has been very informative but I just want some feedback on my situation, I don't have anyone in my life to talk to about this! I'm 21 and I have GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) which causes some mild depression. It's the end of my second week taking 25mg of Sertraline and I'm not sure if this drug is working. The first 4 days I was pretty out of it, yawning a lot, having some jaw discomfort, tired. Then towards the end of the week I felt better, no more yawing or jaw pain, still felt a little tired and was still waking up a couple times in the middle of the night (that's gone now). No anxiety though. Now the second week, I have some anxiety again. Before my heart would beat really fast and my stomach would be in knots and would have racing and obsessive thoughts. Now it feels like I have a weight on my chest and I still have the stomach knots and the racing/obsessive thoughts. It's not all the time like it usually was, but it still happens frequently. Will it take awhile for this to go away or will my dr up my dose? Will taking 50mg even help? She started me on 25mg and kept me there, until I have my next appointment, because I was worried about taking medication. This is embarrassing for me but I also have IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome), I think because of my anxiety, so now that I'm on this medication I have terrible constipation... Does anyone else have this problem? Will it go away? I have also decided to switch to taking the pill at night because I still feel tired in the day and a little more energized at night, I am able to wake up early and feel refreshed, but I start getting crazy tired around noon so I'm going to see if it makes a difference taking the pill at night. Anyway I just wanted to post on here so I can get some personal stories and not feel so lost, I get scared having to tell my dr how I feel, I am always on the verge of tears and it's embarrassing! Sometimes I wonder if medication will even help me and it really worries me that it's not something that can be helped. My anxiety really is debilitating, I not the same person as I was, I don't want to go out and do things as much because I'm always in my head worrying about stupid stuff! I love theatre and acting, I even want to be an actor, but my anxiety has gotten so bad I don't know if I can do it anymore. Maybe this just comes with the age, except I don't really have any pressures right now. I still live with my parents with no job (I had one, but I couldn't handle it with my anxiety) So I just go to college. Anyway I'm done, thank you for taking the time to read this.

This nausea prohibits me from eating too much at once and if I do I WILL vomit out whatever was in my stomach at the time (all unwillingly).

Because i was honest with a new insurance provider that required a pre-auth and they denied it.

I am so tearful, and easy to loose it with my family.  I should also mention that I am just 4 weeks post op for an extensive shoulder surgery, and the pain is still so severe.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome,https://www.drugs.com/answers/irritable-bowel-syndrome-823509.html,Irritable Bowel Syndrome - PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME???,"... medical issues ever... that is up until about a year ago. The first symptoms I can recall were less frequent bowel movements and constantly feeling like I needed to move my bowels and could not do so. The next symptoms I began to notice were strange ""squishy"" noises coming from my stomach-most noticeably when I would touch it-as well as feeling things actually inside my stomach punching me from the inside(I now believe these are spasms). I also felt like there was a constant solid mass in my stomach at all times. I still currently experience all of these symptoms however the frequency of them has become a 24 hours a day/7 days a week thing when it used to not be daily. I cannot pinpoint any stressful situation or time I was going through a year ago that would all of a sudden trigger these symptoms. I at first self treated using laxatives,stool softeners, and enemas. These produced bowel movements but I always felt the urge to go more and it would not happen. For the most part, I could not have a bowel movement without using a laxative or enema. I finally went to my PCP who ordered some tests (thryoid etc-all came back with no abnormalities) and referred me to a GI doctor. I had an extremely awful experience with Dr. James Pilla (in Pittsburgh), the GI specialist I was referred to go see. At the first appointment this past June, I was very specific in the fact that I cannot have a bowel movement without the aid of something and even then my bowel movements are *maybe* once per week-and he did not seem to find any of this abnormal. So he encouraged miralax (which I already told him I had to discontinue bec. I was still not having bowel movements just becoming bloated to the point I could not even sit down) and a high fiber diet (approx. 30 grams a day)-which after doing my own research, all of the message boards say NOT to eat a high fiber diet with IBS-C because it will exacerbate symptoms-which proved to be 100% accurate and caused me more pain than I had ever been in before-still with no bowel movements. I went through with a colonoscopy-which was noted to be ""unremarkable"". He also prescribed both bentyl and linzness-neither of which improved my symptoms at all. About 2 weeks after the colonoscopy, I was having a particularly bad flare-up ( I hadn't had a bowel movement in 5-6 days, I could not wear anything but leggings or sweatpants because my stomach was so bloated, and it literally felt like I had worms in my stomach because there was so much movement) and ended up going to the ER. They ended up doing an x-ray and CT scan and I was told the only thing they saw was ""a lot of stool"". They sent me home after 8 hours with the instructions to ""drink magnesium citrate""-which I did and it finally produced a bowel movement but not for another 24 hours. I am very frustrated because I have a high deductible insurance plan ($2500) and I have not gotten what I feel is any useful treatment and I have had to pay nearly $2500 for nothing. My insurance would not cover medical nutritional therapy or nutritional services and I could not afford to pay for it out of pocket. I attended a CCFA symposium and obtained the name of a group (Allegheny Center for Digestive Health) that treats GI issues-however the only physician in the group who specializes in IBS is not taking new patients, however I did make an appointment with another provider in the group. I, on my own, have ceased a high fiber diet however I still experience excruciating pain nearly all day every day to the point that I am not able to sit down and if I am forced to like at work-I have to get up every 10-15 minutes. I have significantly less pain standing up or lying down.

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/anxiety-properly-tapering-ativan-531018.html,Anxiety - Properly tapering off Ativan?,"Hi everyone So glad to have found this place. I have suffered from severe anxiety, panic attacks, OCD, stress-intolerance, Agoraphobia and a few other anxiety-related disorders for about 12 years now. I've also been taking Ativan (1mg) for the last 4 years and was splitting my pills in half. At first, I was only taking one pill as needed whenever I had a panic attack or encountered a particularly stressful situation but later, I began just taking a half pill three times a day (when I woke up, at 4:00PM and just before bedtime). This went on for several years. I never took more than this because I didn't want to become too addicted or give in to the tolerance by increasing my dosage over time. Recently, my doctor has been increasingly resistant to prescribing these pills and even getting visibly angry when I ask for them. During the last visit I was really put throught the wringer and he ended up only giving me half of what he normally prescribes after a stern lecture and a threat to cut me off completely. He also put me on an anti-depressant which I've already told him twice I had a bad reaction to.  Knowing that I risked being cut off and that being forced to go off of the pills abruptly could cause severe withdrawals, I decided to begin tapering on my own just in case and to prepare myself for the day when I wouldn't have them around anymore. For the last 5 days, I have dropped my daily dosage from a half 1mg pill 3 times each day to just a 1/4 of a pill 3 times a day. It has been one tough ride so far and I never realized that I had become THIS dependant on them until now. The first day was the worst and then that night I had some really wild dreams and woke up wishing I could just stay in bed for a hundred years. I felt like a zombie. Like my brain had been sucked out of my head. Zero motivation. Zero emotion. Like a robot. The next day I felt about the same way although I felt only slightly better that evening but then the increased anxiety, fears and paranoia set in. I began to have all sorts of obsessions about being spied on and tracked by government agents. I was ID'd at the pharmacy for the first time and that sent me into a paranoid frenzy. I took my dog to the vet and they took a picture of him which I thought was just a ""ploy"" to get a picture of me. I went outside and at the same time, my neighbor came out to sit on his porch and looked over at me which lead me to believe he was spying on me. I would also get what I believe are myclonic jerks (where a muscle suddenly ""fires"" and your arm jumps or twitches a little bit, etc). Over the next few days other little things happened which made me suspicious and paranoid and I began magnifying every event in my mind to the point where it got completely out of control. I began looking up my symptoms and it sounded like schizophrenia and that terrified me. I read about psychosis and that made me even more afraid. I thought I was losing my mind. Then I began reading about benzo withdrawal and how it can mimic the symptoms of schizophrenia and make people very paranoid and cause lots of the other symptoms I have been experiencing lately. The shame is that at a time when I am under increased stress and anxiety, I am having to taper off of the same medication that is used to treat my anxiety and that makes the whole situation even worse. Anyway, having given some background here, I guess what I'm wondering is...  1) Does it sound like I tapering correctly or should I not have cut my daily dose in half like I did?. 2) Is there anything I can take to lessen the severity of the withdrawal symptoms?. 3) Do any of these withdrawal symptoms sound normal for my situation... are they typical?. 4) I have read in many places that Valium is the best benzo to use for tapering but after I've tapered off Ativan do I then stop using it altogether and switch to Valium -or- is it safe to start the Valium WHILE at the same time I'm taking the tapered doses of Ativan?. Thanks for any input on thse things and again, so glad to be here!. - Jaybird "

It lasts the entire rest of the day until I go to bed.  This past May, I had the same headaches for an entire month. At first they would come only in the evening when I left work to go to class, but they increased in frequency until the pain was almost constant. I went to every doctor I could think of, from a chiropractor to my eye doctor, and I even went to the ER. It eventually went away on its own and I'm not sure what the actual cure was.  Now that it is back I am very worried that it will stick around like it did last time. It's very disruptive. I think I either have chronic tension headaches or cluster headaches.

Nausea / Vomiting,https://www.drugs.com/answers/has-anyone-been-successfully-treated-for-estrogen-379372.html,Has anyone been successfully treated for estrogen dominance and if so how?,"I'm 23, I follow a rigorous but healthy diet and exercise plan, yet I'm gaining weight rapidly.  I suffer from excruciating cramps and heavy flow, depression, insomnia, panic attacks, upset stomach, inflammed liver, intense malaise, groginess throughout the day, dry and irritible skin, cold hands and feet, mood swings, thinning hair, sore muscles (especially in the back), sore and asymmetrical breasts, constant bloating, brain fog, migraines, and increasingly suicidal impulses, all of which are becoming worse and worse.  Thyroid tests are negative, but estrogen dominence may account for it not showing up.  My doctor put me on levathroxyn for about 6 months. When my symptoms continued to worsen and I put on another 20 lbs, I thought I must need a higher dose for the medicine to take effect. But I suffered tremors and rapid heartbeat on the 100mg, so I stopped taking it altogether.  To be completely honest, I can't afford to go to an endocrynologist (even if I could find one in the remote area I live in) or pay for anymore bloodwork, since I'm still paying off the thyroid test from 6 months ago. But I'm fairly certain I have ED.  So for about a week now, I've been taking a half tsp of ground oregano, thyme, and turmeric 3 times a day with meals (as recommended for ED) and have felt a little more balanced and my period came and went with little to no pain or bloating. Otherwise there's been no noticeable difference; my body isn't responding to diet or exercise. I've had one or two good night's sleep, but my insomnia and anxiety are as bad as ever during the night's between. What's more, I worry there may be some adverse effect I'm not aware of in regard to these herbs I'm taking.  I've considered progesterone hormone treatment, but I've heard really horrible reviews; mostly weight gain, hairloss, and a general worsening of all symptoms (including an increased risk of cancer and liver damage), which is supposed to be all part of the process. And I'm still not certain whether you have to continue taking the suppliments forever, whether you can wean yourself off it, or whether the dosage must be strengthened as your body builds a tolerance. No two sites I've visited seem to agree, and the only positive reviews I've read on this hormone therapy were few and trivial. I want to avoid taking such drastic measures as progesterone hormone treatment, the process of which sounds very expensive, risky, unpromising, and even dangerous. And I'd like to avoid becoming bodily addicted to anything or having to take a medication that would have to be strengthened as my tolerance builds up.   Obesity, hypothyroidism, ovarian cancer, high blood pressure, low heartrate, stroke, liver damage, deep veins, brittle hair, and loss of hair all over the body run in both sides of my family.  My problems began ever since I was little. When I was about eight or so, I started putting on a lot of weight for no reason, and no matter how little I ate or how hard I exercised, nothing seemed to work. From age 12 to 15, I lived on 200 calories a day while doing extremely hard 45 minute exercise segments in the morning, noon, and night, between very active and difficult farmwork. Never lost an inch.   A few years ago, I put myself on weight watchers and was thrilled to lose about thirty pounds, even though I was eating more and exercising less than ever. But about a year later, without doing anything differently, I began gaining again. I gained back all the weight I'd lost plus an extra fifty lbs.  I've continued the diet and have doubled the exercise routine (keeping rigorous but not to the point of exhaustion as before). But I'm terrified that I'll continue to gain. Please, if anyone has any information as to what it is I have, what my options are to treat it, if any of the treatments have been successful, if there are any risks to taking oregano, thyme, and turmeric 3 times a day, inform me.  Sincerely,  Desperate "

It appeared to work quite well for my anxiety, (although the situation I was in had changed as well) and with the addition of therapy, I felt pretty stable for about a year (out of the two years on it). I decided in August that I wanted to try getting off of it (I never planned on being on it for my whole life, I also gained at least 20 lbs while on it, exercise and switching to a vegan diet only helped slightly, I also had very low libido and just felt a bit emotionally flat lined while on it).  I tapered down by 37.5 mg every 4 weeks. I took my last pill (it was a 37.5 mg tablet) 5 weeks ago. Looking back, I think I tapered down too fast. Anyways, I went through about 2 weeks of the expected brain zaps, dizziness, vertigo, heightened anxiety, nausea, etc. However now, at 5 weeks, I still have the anxiety and nausea.

I no longer have any negative thoughts that bring on the anxious feelings; it will strike out of nowhere. I can be sitting and eating dinner when all of the sudden I will have trouble breathing and get the jitters and enter panic mode.

Migraine,https://www.drugs.com/answers/dexamethasone-call-deathamethasone-720431.html,"Getting off Dexamethasone, Or as I like to call it, (Deathamethasone)?","... I was prescribed this drug from my quack... supposed Migraine Specialist, Thankfully he has since retired but I wonder at what cost to all his past patients? Regardless I did find out that I have severe food allergies that trigger Migraines along with some physical neck problems. The prescribed dose was 8mg per headache. So if I had a headache a week? You all can do the math. This has been over a four year period of Idiocy. I have researched over the years turns out the half life of Dex is approximately 72 hours?(correct me if Im wrong) with this strength it appeared to me to last almost a week, I could almost time my headaches. As it turns out and along with the math, the Dex, or lack thereof was causing my headaches.(Constant Cycling) took a number of years to figure all this out. I went from 8mg to 4mg to 2mg to 1mg alone, by myself. Then came the fun part. All the side effects, weight gain, stomach issues, trying to get off this stuff. I couldn't figure out why when I would stop off the 1mg for over 4 days, etc... I could hardly walk up the stairs? after recent lab work up... (adrenal Insufficiency) very low Cortisol levels. I thankfully have a pretty good doc and we have been working together to hopefully get me off this stuff. I am now on Cortisol (Cortef/hydrocortisone) to hopefully finish weaning myself off all this. With the Cortisol, it needs to be taken three times a day. Its a lot safer than all the other steroids due to short acting nature. The information that I have gathered and by my Doc is this could take 6 months maybe more to get my adrenals to kick back in. Thankfully, I have no other medical issues. I have put on a little weight which I'm slowly exercising off, all my other lab work is good. Im hoping this long drawn out process of getting off this stuff is normal. Any comments would be appreciated. I suppose it could be worse. But im hoping that my adrenals will kick in faster than many months or years? Try to avoid steroids like the plague. Ask your Doc lots of questions before doing these. If you have to go on steroids make sure you have a great Doc, and a plan in place to get off them. take lots of lab test to check your levels and work with your Doc. If he or she wont give you the amount of time to ask questions, etc... make their life miserable. You deserve answers and a fix. They need to be responsible for their actions as well as us as patients. Thanks All "

I took Dramamine, which knocked me out for the rest of the trip, and I left it at that. It happened again on my next long car trip. And nothing helped. I was just miserable. Headache, nausea. Then it began happening on short trips to town, whether I was a passenger or driving. Now I get headaches simply from walking into the next room. It seems to be both the position and movement that triggers things. Just going from lying down to sitting up causes a slight headache. Then getting up and walking makes the headache worse. Just getting up, I seem to have an issue with balance. I think the nausea happens when the headache gets bad. Zofran sometimes helps the nausea. The headache starts at the top/front of my head, behind my forehead. As it worsens I feel it at the base of my skull as well. I feel a ""pressure"" behind my eyes, but not like eye strain, like you'd get from reading a lot. When I feel that eye ""pressure"" is about when the nausea kicks in. When the headache is REALLY bad, my temples throb. I also feel a strange pressure very deep in my ear. Yes I've been checked for ear infections an am clear. But it's not like when you feel your ears pop, it's deeper than that. I know... it all sounds very weird, and I'm starting to feel like I'm losing my MIND!!! I had a head CT done a week ago and was told it was clear. I also deal with fibromyalgia, and use 100mcg fentanyl patches and 10-325 Norco for break through pain. These ""episodes"" began before my last increase in fentanyl from 75mcg to the current 100mcg. Though I don't really think it's the pain meds causing the episodes, I would also like to get off of them as well. I'd like to switch to holistic medicine, but I live in a rural area, and it's just not accessible here. :( I'd be very eager to hear from anyone on the topic of holistic treatment, fibromyalgia, and if you have any clue about these ""episodes"" please share. Thank you! "

Migraine,https://www.drugs.com/answers/can-you-please-tell-me-why-meperdine-is-being-66210.html,Why is meperdine being pulled from my local pharmacy?,"My Dr. treated me with meperdine for the past 3 years, to keep severe migraines from making me non-functional. I have severe allergic reactions to most all other pain medications. Mepergan was the medicine that helped me with my severe pain, and allowed me to be normal. I could go to work, church, and sports events, I could clean my house, and just be normal. The mepergan also had an anti-nausea med (promethazine) combined in the dark red capsule. That was a dream med. to me, because the pain was GONE, and I was not throwing up! No one can tell me why this drug is not available anymore, and I have no idea where to start to try to find something else that works for me. I had been through so many others meds, that made me sick, before using meperdine. I have asked my local pharmacy for the reason to discontinue this med. and I was given this answer ""I really dont know""... Is there another medicine that I dont know about, that might give me the same results? I have tried, non-narcotic, as well as other narcotic drugs. Nothing works like meperdine. It is very hard to have a conditon that can actually stop you for days at a time! It is as hard to know that there had been a medication that helped me, but will not be available anymore. What kind of studies were done before this action was taken? Were patients questioned?? I would like to share my story to the FADA. I have all of my records that show the difference, in my Dr. visits while being able to use meperdine, as opposed to when it was no longer available to me. I would appreciate any information on this subject, as well as advice. I suffer on a regular basis, and was much more active, and functional, when I had meperdine if or when I needed it. Can you help me?? "

Migraine,https://www.drugs.com/answers/neurontin-helpful-ocular-migraine-aura-1076828.html,Neurontin: helpful for ocular migraine aura?,"Almost two years ago I became very stressed and continue to be (caring for an very elderly parent) and began having episodes of ocular migraine: vision was disrupted for about 30 minutes and then resolved, (no traditional head pain), there was one incident of total blackout in one eye.  Episodes begin with a small blind spot and progress (in both eyes) usually to a C-shape that is black and contains gold zig-zags. The shape appears to be getting closer/larger and shimmers, intrudes on my field of vision and gradually dissipates and flutters off. Or it appears as a shimmering gold blob. I even gt them in the middle of the night! In my sleep! As time progressed I tried topomax (sp?) with horrible reaction. Calan SR a blood pressure drug had no effect, botox shots in the head don't seem to help.  Episodes now sometimes piggyback: one in progress, another starts, or an episode resolves and another begins within the hour. I have had as many as five episodes in one day. There are no consistent triggers, however, many times looking in a mirror initiates an event as can the computer screen and the smart phone screen.  I also have strange itching in my upper back and across the mid section which my GP said is ""notalgia"" a nerve trigger where the perception of the itching is due to a spine issue--(perhaps osteoporosis?)  Feverfew and butterbur didn't help, massage therapy and acupuncture have little effect. SO, today my neurologist who I called in desperation (I have had 4 negative MRI's and other tests) prescribed NEURONTIN. I also have several vertigo episodes a month where I feel I can't converge my eyes for about 10 minutes. I made an appointment with a specialist in this field at my neurologist's recommendation. All this is beyond disconcerting! I have been reading here that many people found relief with this drug and others complain of side-effects. I am putting-off taking the first pill until I get some more input. Has anyone had a similar situation to mine and found relief for visual disturbance issues? I am concerned about worsened vertigo and blurred vision as well as the fatigue and word-retrieval problems. (I need words, I am a writer) Thanks so much!

Migraine,https://www.drugs.com/answers/amitriptyline-hello-first-question-past-30-years-3398771.html,Amitriptyline - Hello all. My first question. For the past 30 years I’ve used 75mg amitriptyline...,... before bed daily for migraines.  Before that I would get migraines 6-7 days a week. It went down to 3-4 a week.  And were not as severe. I never really had a problem falling asleep before taking amytiproline. But after taking for so long if I forgot to take my nightly dose. I could not fall asleep most the night. Even tho taking it seems to have worked with the migraines all these years. I really don’t want to have to take medicines for the rest of my life. And also thought it can’t really be that good for me. I mean when you take the pill if you don’t drink good right away. They burn your throat. So they must be burning something else.  But one of the reason I wanted to take it back then because I was taking so many Advil etc for the pain.  Also I still find myself taking extra strength Advil 4-5 days a week. And even taking amitriptyline I still had to.  After all these years I started wondering if my body changed. And maybe I could lower my dose. Well my doctor wasn’t helpful at all. Said I had to take it for the rest of my life. I’ve had this doctor for 35 years.  So I decided to wean myself off my doctor and amitriptyline dependency.  So because I was taking it for so many years I took three weeks to do so. I also wrote down as much info of how I felt during the process.  First day noticed it took longer for me to fall asleep. That didn’t bother me because I don’t go to bed until I’m tired. However the more I weaned myself off the longer it took to get tired. Also when I do fall asleep I actually find myself waking up just from me turning over. Or the wind blowing hard.  But I’m probably just so used to being out cold.  Hoping that gets better with more time.  I also always new weather was a cause of some migraines. But while I was earning myself off realized how sensitive I was to the outside presssure. If I woke up and had a headache it was a rainy morning. If it was nice in the morning I usually woke up with no headache. If it started to rain or snow in the afternoon. I usually had a headache. So to me this was odd. Because while on Amytriptoline if you wake up with a migraine you will have a migraine until you go through your next sleep cycle. And sometimes it took two days of sleep cycles. But rarely would I only have a headache for a partial day.  So yes supper pressure sensitive and non tired sensitive. But even not falling asleep and waking up I feel 100% more energy and mentally keen daily being off it.  Also noticed that I have a lot more energy while being off amitriptyline I have noticed for the past 20 years I always felt fatigued and simply always tried to fight it.  It’s been a week since I’ve been off it completely. I feel my headaches are the same pattern they have always been on using amitriptyline. I also feel a hell of a lot better in the mornings not being groggy.  I’m assuming I may still have a week or so left until the amitriptyline is out of my body completely. I’m hoping that I can become tired earlier in the evenings soon. And also hoping my migraines to get worse.  I can say that I am so happy for myself that I am off completely.  Sorry for the book here. Look forward to your thoughts. Would love to hear from other doctors or patients that have used it as long as I. And also from people that weaned themselves off. Thanks

I have been suffering for 35+ years from these debilitating headaches. I have tried 90% of the prescription pills, injections, sprays, patches, and combinations of all of these rx meds, OTC pain relievers, weekly massages, essential oils, keeping extensive food and headache diaries, accupuncture, etc. Two of my former neurologists (who I can't see anymore because they don't accept my medical insurance) prescribed Stadol Nasal Spray (yes, it is a narcotic/controlled substance) to help me get almost immediate relief for my pain until my migraine pill kicked in. The spray was not long lasting, maybe 30-45 minutes of relief, just long enough for the relpax, maxalt or whatever migraine pill I was on at the time, to kick in. I have asked my new neurologist, my PCP, and my pain doctors to please prescribe this for me again, but no one will. I understand the issues and controversies regarding prescribing narcotics for these headaches as well as dependency issues, however I never had a dependency issue with this med or any other med in the past. I pretty much have a constant daily headache that doesn't go away. My quality of life is in the toilet, my marriage is rocky, at best, and my friends and family are sick of hearing me complain. I don't know how to make the pain subside or go away, yet my doctors continue to prescribe me the same meds every month, knowing they aren't giving me much relief, yet when I have repeatedly told them what has worked in the past, they won't prescribe it for me. I guess my question is, has anyone been prescribed this spray for migraines and if so, what hoops do I need to jump through to the relief from the constant pain I am in. Sorry for the length of my explanation, but thank you for taking the time to read this. "

I originally went to Cleveland clinic and was diagnosed with possible occipital nerve irritation, migraines, vestibular disorder, underlie issues of cervicalgia. Two doctors have thrown in possible thoracic outlet. I then got into a appointment I had waited on for 4 months with a otoneurologist at OSU. He diagnosed me with cervical dystonia. He is also sending me to a doctor to rule out the thoracic outlet. He doesn't feel I have that. It makes sense to me because I had been through 2 rounds of PT and massage therapy and it never held. My neck and shoulders are so painful. The doctor in Cleveland put me on gabapentin for the occipital nerve irritation. I stayed on it 3 weeks and stopped it on my own. Things got worse after that in the occipital area. I have went back on it. I have a couple questions. My initial symptom when starting this was a dizziness (swaying feeling) not rotational.

Now, when I finally get out of bed at 2 in the afternoon, I feel like I've been hit by a truck. I had to leave work early tonight due to just feeling like crap! I've only been taking Effexor about 2 weeks. My depression is MUCH better, but now I physically feel terrible all the time. Will this likely go away, or should I stop taking it and go back to Lexapro? On a side note: I took Effexor XR years ago, and I don't remember having these side effects. Any help is appreciated! "

Migraine,https://www.drugs.com/answers/fiorinal-headache-medication-10-years-ago-813908.html,Fiorinal - Looking for a headache medication that I took 10 years ago…?,"I started having really bad headaches after college. I went to several doctors that put me on many different meds but nothing ever worked. I thought I would never get relief until I talked to my grandmother about it. She told me that she also had headaches most of her life. She also went to several doctors but she finally went to one that put her on a medication that made her headaches nonexistent! So, I went to my doctor and started taking it…she was right! It was WONDERFUL, I couldn’t believe that I didn’t have to suffer anymore. My memory is HORRIBLE but I remember that I took the medication for almost a year until I met my future husband! After we started dating I stopped taking the medication (to see if I could live life without meds). Through the years I had headaches but nothing too bad. Unfortunately, that didn’t last and now I’m back to where I was 10 years ago! What’s worse is that I can’t remember the name of the medication I took that made them go away!!! I know what your thinking…there has to be some way to get the name of it, right? Well, 10 years is a long time. I no longer see the doctor that prescribed it because she moved away. My grandmother passed away a few years ago, as well. :( SO, I’m totally lost and have no idea if I will ever find out what it was?? The only thing I know is that it was for headaches and I THINK it started with an F. I have searched the internet non-stop. This summer I found something that sounded familiar (Fiorinal) so I went to my doctor and started taking it. I realized right away that I was wrong. It didn’t help at all so I tried Fioricet, same thing! I wish I could remember but it’s just not in my brain anymore. The only thing I think is that the name of the medication was similar to Fiorinal??? With ALL THAT SAID, I am hoping someone can help me??? I know that my odds are slim but I’m hoping that someone will be able to help me figure it out!!! Suggestions would also be great! Fingers crossed- K :) "

Nausea / Vomiting,https://www.drugs.com/answers/lutera-constant-nausea-572251.html,Lutera - doe anyone else have constant Nausea?,This is my first time using birth control. I got on it because I always got nauseous and dizzy before and during my periods and I couldn't stand it any longer. The first 2 and a half weeks I experienced no side effects other than breast growth and tenderness which doesn't bother me at all. And then at the end of the third week I got nauseous one night and ever since then I've been nauseous almost every day. It starts either in the afternoon around 3 or 4 or at night around 7 or 8. I take the pill at 11 in the morning. I called my doctor and she said I have to wait three months to see if the side effects go away before switching to another pill. I am half way through my second pack and I recently started getting acne on my face and I have a yeast infection. It just seems like the side effects keep getting worse the longer I'm on the pill. Luckily though I have had no spotting which seems to be common among Lutera users. I'm just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and if their side effects disappeared after the first three months.

During this summer its been very hard to eat the daily amount of food i need to eat. As a amateur bodybuilder i need to eat a surplus of calories to build lean muscle, this task has been easy for years up until this past summer. I'm assuming the nausea is from the horrible anxiety. This past week i was prescribed Lexapro from my doctor, i took it for 4 days and started to feel very sucidal and very anxious, i stopped taking it yesterday and it seems like these past days have been even worse in terms of me feeling nausea. And when i feel nausea i get more anxiety, which feeds the vicious cycle. I believe if i stop feeling nausea all day and start getting my appetite back that i will feel much better and my anxiety will decrease. Im pretty certain on stopping my Lexapro medication, and ive been doing research into anti-depressants that make you less nausea and increase your appetite.

I started on 5mg and worked up to 15mg. I have been on 15mg for 2.5 weeks.  For the last few months I have been struggling with nausea. I wake up most mornings feeling sick to my stomach and will dry rech and shake. The nausea goes after 1-3 hours but will usually return intermittently throughout the day.

Migraine,https://www.drugs.com/answers/anyone-found-successful-treatment-severe-gastro-3456034.html,Has anyone found successful treatment for the severe gastro-intestinal trouble from Aimovig?,"I did a review, explaining Aimovig 2 month trial worked well on my migraines. However, after a couple weeks of first shots, I started gastro pain, bloating, gas, constipation. It was not too bad first month. I used Prevacid, took Rolaids/Tums and used Dulcolax. The second month, it was BAD. I wasn't able to combat it and it has affected daily life and every meal. Im not on the drug now, its 3rd month. The ""drug company"" called me in the very beginning, I filled out all paperwork. I was told I qualified for financial payment of the first full year since I am poor, barely above Medicaid level. At the end of 2month trial, they called me and sent a letter stating I needed to rush and push my doctor to authorize everything. This was already done in the beginning and I was told that. I called them both to confirm the info before starting the trial! Someone lied somewhere. I thought about the gastro trouble, and I called my doctor to confirm that the drug was to be paid for... and why I needed approval again? Nothing has been done, I haven't received the drug or anymore paperwork and I have decided due to severe gastro intestinal trouble DAILY that I am not going to fight for it anymore. I have constant daily, gas pain, feel bloated no matter what I eat, and still using Dulcolax. This drug can't be good long term. The damage to me daily is not worth what I am going through. It hurts your stomach, physically. I am angry that the drug company lied to me early on. The doctor is aggravated too - all his patients that could pay were fine - but all the patients like me were lied to by the drug company and drug reps pushing it - knowing that we were put in a trial for 2 months and no way were they going to honor the payments of that drug! It costs $500plus for 1 shot and I had a 2 shot dosage. When I called Aetna they said ""it is not even on our drug lists yet and won't be reviewed for the first year. I did not worry as I was told I would be covered by the drug manufacturer, but I was curious how Aetna was handling this for later on. The pharmacist here told me ""they can't even get the drug yet and how did I get it?"" I explained it was sent from TX pharmacy associated with drug manufacturer and I told him how I was treated and what has happened to me since. He shook his head, with no comment except, that ""he was getting a lot of heat from all the patients treated just like me."" I told my doctor I am angry how they did this rollout, and how awful it was that poor patients on a 2month trial KNOWING it was going to end there! Look what it has done to my stomach, all the gastro comments online and manufacturer does not even mention... on top of how it feels to be a trial patient just to go online and do write-ups for them. This is inexcusable, it shows the power the drug companies have and nothing will be done. I see many online comments like mine. This gastro intestinal situation is painful and I pray it will subside on its own. Im scared about my stomach later on and how long this takes to get out of the system as many have commented. "

I tried once last week but w/ lots of nausea so stopped and am trying again. For the past 3 days, I've taken it in the morning about 20 min. after drinking a cup of milk (in my coffee), and a breakfast of egg whites, buttered toast (or turkey bacon) and an orange. I read somewhere to add peanut butter, so I bury the pill in about 2 teaspoons of the PB. I have had no nausea and I think it's the PB that helps.  But I am very, very bloated right now and look about 6 months pregnant. Passing some gas, but not a lot. Plus I have horrible acid reflux that is burning my throat. Bowels are good and soft (but not runny).  Best news is that the depression seems to be lifting, and the anxiety too. After reading the feedback here, it seems mixed, but I'm sensing some have had luck sticking it out. Has anyone else experienced initial bloating (like a lot) that went away, or acid reflux? I dread getting on the scale with the bloating. I also am on Wellbutrin (300 mg XL). No dreams yet, but I did wake up a couple of times in the night (it took me an hour to fall back to sleep during the second wake up).

Migraine,https://www.drugs.com/answers/midrin-prodrin-anyone-switched-similar-results-3306983.html,Midrin to Prodrin: Has anyone switched and had similar results as they did on Midrin?,"I am a chronic migraine sufferer, I've been getting migraines for 18 years now. Back in the day, I was on Midrin for migraines, and it was the first medication in a long line of trial and error that worked for my migraines. Prior to Midrin, I had tried Maxalt, Zomig, Relpax, Imitrex, and codeine with Tylenol. I loved the Midrin, and the bonus was that not only did it get rid of my migraines, but I was also able to work and do everything as normal - which is not the case with some of the other heavy meds they tried me on for migraines. After Midrin was taken off the market I was eventually switched to a combination of other medications (Fioricet and Toradol pills), which only works about 85% of the time, and with the Toradol I worry about the effect it could have on my kidneys.  My question is: Has anyone that used to have great success with Midrin for migraines switched to Prodrin and seen good results as far as migraines go?  I am thinking about asking my doctor about Prodrin (as I just found out that it is close to Midrin in chemical makeup) but if it doesn't work very well then I may as well stick with what I am already doing.

I'm seeing a psychiatrist soon to see exactly what's wrong with my head, and I have a months supply of Concerta to see if it's improved my ""condition"".

Nausea / Vomiting,https://www.drugs.com/answers/notice-warnings-for-interaction-of-tramadol-and-284433.html,Notice warnings for interaction of tramadol and anti-nauseants. Should dimenhydrinate be included?,"I noticed warnings of interactions between general anti-nauseants and tramadol. My 1st time taking 1 x 100 mg. tramadol sustained release proved pretty unpleasant, as I had taken 2 x 50 mg. generic dimenhydrinate (also found in gravol) earlier in the day for some comparatively moderate nausea and 1 or 2 instances of vomiting that morning.  My nausea is generally caused by liver damage, but can be set off by something as simple as a cup of coffee. Also in the mix was 1500 mg. of acetaminophen and 400 mg. of naproxen sodium, also taken much earlier. I am well accustomed to these since I have been taking them on and off for 4 years. In fact, it was my idea to get my liver checked, not any doctor, and when it showed up damaged in blood tests, it was my theory that it was the acetaminophen that had damaged it, which the doctors all jumped on right away, sure, yeah, that's the ticket, though they didn't offer any remedy, and I had to try to use natural supplements such as milk thistle and burdock root and dandelion root capsules and tea to help the detoxification load and allow some limited regeneration.  Anyway, the point is that i couldn't keep anything down that day, couldn't even get to the washroom. Could this be a direct result of the dimenhydrinate? Should there be a specific warning in the interactions checker on this site for example?  I have heard that the initial use of tramadol can be pretty nauseating in itself, so maybe that was it. And like I said, I had already thrown up a little earlier that morning.  Any ideas?  At the very least, allow my experience to inform and help.  Also, I just wanted to address all the pointless comments from people comparing tramadol to the pantheon of natural, semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids, such as codeine, morphine, hydro_____, and oxy_____, etc. among other comparisons I've seen. Don't be mislead by that, the reason I came across tramadol in my extensive research is that it helps with allodynia, which is the aspect of nerve pain, A.K.A. diabetic (and other) neuropathy or neuralgia that gives pain response with only the lightest of touch. In my case, this means just wearing a sock that is too tight would cause pain. The tramadol is working well so far. My nerve damage was due to a deep laceration which became infected and the white blood cells indiscriminantly attack the infected area and the myelin sheath on the nerves among other parts of the nervous system become damaged.  In fact, most opioids are ineffective for pain from nerve damage. The actual receptors on your spine are lost when the nerves are damaged as I remember the research. Injections of cannabinoids are more effective than morphine, etc. Most opioids are short acting, and tolerance is rapidly built up, needing more and more with less relief. I was popping little codeine pills on their own with little to no relief for neuropathy. I even had some oxycodone, which did little, though it did help with my unrelated back pain.  Good luck, all!

Nausea / Vomiting,https://www.drugs.com/answers/coped-radiation-therapy-666061.html,How I coped with radiation therapy?,"Hi. I learned some things that I'd like to share with you. I only had nose-face radiation, but I listened to the techs and doctor and learned things that could help everybody. I'll dispel some myths too- Radiation isn't a new thing-my father had it about 1954-55 and he didn't throw up. He had stomach cancer, and had many surgeries, where his small intestines were removed. We didn't have the burn cremes- fluorides for the teeth-a good diet that we have now. I rubbed baby oil on him and he maintained well. He was an experimental patient for his type of cancer.  I kept my hair. I was going to shave my hair off, but the doctor told me that I wouldn't lose it. I only lost hair in the radiation site-my upper lip and nose. My hair is still down below my shoulder blades. I had forgotten that my father didn't lose his hair either. We have radiation everywhere-radon in the homes, at the dentist office, when we have X-Rays, CAT Scans, PET Scans, MRIs. This really isn't so different. I was told that I had a very high dosage.  Try not to freeze up from fear. The first day-they had to mark the area with a washable marker, so they could cut out the radiation area. The doctor asked me if I could slide over a few inches, change an angle. I did so. The doctor said good. Many patients refuse to move a finger, refuse to slide up or down, and the techs have to move you into position. The techs told me that many curse, when the techs try to position these patients. Some patients even hit and kick. It's obvious that any pain will be made worse by people moving you, while you are rigid, resisting or even fighting the techs. I'd rather move myself and control the pain.  Put one teaspoon of baking soda in 8 oz of water. Rinse your mouth out with that solution about half a dozen times a day. It helps fight dry mouth, any sores to heal up. Cancer and cancer treatments mess with your immune system, so a person that gets radiation on the leg can get mouth sores from the prick from a toothbrush bristle. My father had this problem-but we didn't know about the baking soda rinse. He also didn't know that food hot from the stove also made these sores. EAT, EAT, and EAT. Choose your food wisely-vitamins, protein, calcium, calories. The first week, I became a chow hound. My scale showed that I lost several lbs in the first 3 days-I really ate-and regained the 3 lbs. Then the next week I gained more weight. The first week, the nurse asked me what I ate. She shared the recipes with other patients. 5 regained the lost weight, and maintained. 4 were busy- the 5th spent her time in bed.  Especially for mouth-throat radiation eat really soft food. Even with that-I had about 4 days-where it hurt my gum to eat poached eggs. My teeth aren't temperature sensitive- it's radiation on the roots of my teeth. "

The side effects were headaches, nausea feeling, swelling of the tongue, tingling of the lips, insomnia, restless feeling and some constipation. I called my doctor and he had me to stop. I suffer also from severe migraines and IBS. I will talk with him again on Thursday to see if a different treatment will work. I do not want something that will make me gain weight. I first started to feel symptoms this past February. After going through sevaral testing the specialist (after two others) was finally a Rhematoligist that made the diagnosis of Fibromyalgia. I have started doing some research of my own and had found that people with Fibromyalgia can also suffer from miagraines and IBS. I have had these other two conditions for the last four years (and even longer) and then I started to feel the pain in my lower back and knees and then my shoulder and neck area then my left arm and finally my right arm. In the mornings I felt like I was hit by a Mac Truck and as the day went on, I felt even worse and by the end of the day it felt like I was hit by three. The pain just seemed to get worse. I do accounting work so most of my day is sitting and I would get up and just walk after sitting for 2 hours and I felt so still trying to get up and just move. Please share with me some of your experiences because for at least the last 8 months I was wondering if there was anything wrong and I had family members think it was all in my head.  Learning that there is a condition I had learned that my oldest sister was also being treated for this condition. She was also bipolar and other mental illness and she didn't have much of the family support. I was the one that stayed by her side and helped her whenever she needed it because even her own children didn't want to deal with it. My sister has since passed away over 15 months ago from other problems that was misdiagnosed by doctors.  I want to thank you in advance with anyone who would like to share. Elaine "

I was also paired with a tension med as well. Considering my symptoms were cause my hypertension and constant panic attacks. While in the ER the Doctor immediately took two large samples of blood... (what they tested for I don't know?) then I was given an IV with 5 injections. Which made me feel like Jesus!!!

Long story short I've been taking my medicine EXACTLY the way it's prescribed. The last 3 days I was feeling very comfortable and hopeful the hell is almost over. No burning. Very little to NO inflammation, no red lumps or packages that look like I have a chemical burn. No itching. Up until today.

What can I take for severe pain?","I recently developed an allergy to hydrocodone. I break out in intense itching throughout my entire body. I also had an allergic reaction to dilaudid after they gave it to me in the ER - I again broke out in intense itching throughout my body and my face swelled up. I've had two reactions to Demerol (although I've taken it many times after surgeries with no problems, and the Dr. initially thought it was a reaction to Bactrim). One time I was in the recovery room from surgery and again broke out with the massive itching and difficulty breathing - they gave me a shot of benadryl which cleared it up. The other time I was home recovering from surgery - again the whole body itching, red blotches, my throat swelled and closed up and I could hardly breath. They said I almost went into anaphylactic shock. We were able to get to the ER in time and they shot me up with something that stopped the reaction. I have constant severe pain due to my multitude of medical problems and have developed a high tolerance for pain. I only take pain medication when the pain is so bad I just can't take it anymore. Most pain medications make me nauseous, bitchy and irritable, and give me horrible headaches - so I take them as little as possible. I need to know a good, very strong painkiller I can take when needed. Ibuprofen does nothing for my pain - even when taken in a higher dose. I've tried tramadol and ultram, but they make me sick and don't do much for the pain either. Darvocet, Norco, and Vicoden are also out as the generics of them are also hydrocodone. Most likely anything with codeine is out as the pharmacist said I'm probably allergic to it as well. What else can I take? Addiction level of the medication should not be an issue as I do not abuse my medications and only take pain meds when absolutely needed and only for a short period of time. "

Muscle Spasm,https://www.drugs.com/answers/why-are-drs-so-loath-to-prescribe-valium-anymore-170473.html,"Why are Drs. so loath to prescribe valium anymore? It has been a lifesver for my anxiety, etc?","Have several conditions resolved by taking valium. 5-10 mgs on & off for 15 years. All of a sudden, my pain Dr. and reg Dr's offices will not prescribe valium for anyone! ""They no longer prescribe valium.""-a direct quote! Ativan acted just like busbar-they will prescibe those or klonopin. I am confused-something about how long valium stays in your system. Have taken xanax with awful side effects, the ativan didn't help with anxiety, and I could not function-even leave my room-while taking it. Valium really helped with muscle spasms-not so with ativan or buspar. Both of the latter meds acted the same on me-no help at all! I have never abused valium, and have had refills expire. My regular Dr. woul give me 6 mos. of refills; when I was transferred to a pain management specialist, they gave me 3 mos. of refills. Since 30 tabs lasted about 3 mos. my refills would expire. (No-was NOT getting valium from 2 sources-specialist prescribed after my regular Dr. referred me-my refills had expired; I do not Dr. shop or divert.) So what is the big problem with valium, and why are klonopin/ativan preferred all of a sudden? Now the pain specialist office won't even see people who take valium! Is there something I've missed? The FDA site has valium still approved with a 10+ rating. Suicidal thoughts not mentioned except as an afterthought, rare&unusual side effect. Klonopin and all of the SSRI's have that warning right at the top. The only side effect I've had from valium is minor constipation-easily resolved, as I do not take anti-constipation meds on a regular (no pun intended) basis. So what is the problem with valium? It is so inexpensive and treats a number of conditions, from anxiety to muscle spasm, nightmares, tremors, PMS, menopausal mood swings, agoraphobia, major stress (bad for heart-I'm 50 yrs old w/ family history of heart attacks at a young age), sleep disorders, and more. So, instead of one inexpensive occasional 5-10mg valium, I would now have to take -muscle relaxer (robaxin-makes me uncoordinated, xanaflex-totally wiped me out& my eyes would be 'pasted shut' when I awoke), ambien (or seroquel) for sleep, klonopin (which I do not tolerate well, it makes me looney-dead in the head-can't drive,etc.) and probably laxatives as all of these meds can cause constipation. I'm sure they will want to try yet ANOTHER anti-depressant. (The new expensive ones-hello pharmaceutical lobbiests/DEA are now in my Drs. office.) Oh the valium also helps with paranoia-I think, also Pharm reps-I know one personally-do not give docs all the info. They get bonuses, and some Drs. get kickbacks for prescribing the newer, expensive meds. (No paranoia here-direct quote from the rep.) So, after venting-thank you- my question still remains-why are Drs. choosing(?) to no longer prescribe valium? (Also propoxyphene-approved since 1957). Any info would be helpful- thanks! "

Have tried everything, nothing relieves satisfactorily- the pain is like spasms, can burn hot and feel grinding and sharp too. It wakes me up. Pain levels daily/nightly between 6-10 and feels like torture. Seriously has destroyed my entire life. I've bee applying Zostriz HP for about 6 weeks now, and the spasms still occur. I can't say this cream has done anything for me so far but I've read that with chronic pain it can take much longer to feel the pain relieving benefit as this cream works differently than a pain reliever. Should I continue or just accept defeat at the 6/7 week mark? I buy a tube of the cream each week so it's costing me $25 Australian each week - I'd be more than happy to pay even more if I knew it would work eventually, but I'm kinda using hope and because I'm not working, I don't want to waste money if it's past it's ""should have worked by now"" phase.

My LLD (lyme literate doctor) has since retired.  Over the course of 26 years I was on a plethora of pharmaceuticals, but since the last episode 3 years ago I decided to go holistic. I never felt better in my life after getting off of all the Pharmaceuticals! But now I find myself having another Lyme episode along with the symptoms of Babesiosis. I am also uninsured at the moment, so a $900 phlebotomist visit is out of the question. I figure after 26 years battling recurring tick parasites, I know what's going on with my body. With that said, I still have about 30 days worth of doxycycline that I just started 400 mg per day 3 days ago. Additionally, I still have some tramadol 50 mg along with some diazepam 10mg. Those are the three Pharmaceuticals that I have left from a collection of 27 that I was on all at once for the treatment of that last tick bite. doxycycline has a longer shelf life, so I am not concerned with that, but I'm wondering if I can take the lowest dose of both the Tramadol to ease the moderate to severe pain I am experiencing, and a diazepam to quell the essential tremors I am experiencing in my arms and hands despite the fact they expired 2 years ago. I'm not so concerned about any side effects, as I didn't really have any being on 27 Pharmaceuticals t once outside of brain fog and just being sleepy, but I'm at wits end without health insurance and wondering if I should just bite the bullet and take the lowest dose of the tramadol and the diazepam...  I would much rather be using my apple cider vinegar with fresh turmeric and fresh ginger, but it's just not cutting it for this episode. I'm wondering and hoping that there are others out there that struggle with recurring tick parasite symptoms, or maybe just anyone who has taken a combination of expired Pharmaceuticals.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome,https://www.drugs.com/answers/amitiza-working-1060529.html,Amitiza not really working - any advice or suggestions?,"I am a 28 year old female who prior to about 1 1/2 years ago, had absolutely no medical issues, let alone GI issues, to speak of. I'll also say there are no GI issues in my family history, with the exception of my brother who developed ulcerative colitis around the same time I started having constipation issues. All of a sudden I went from having regular bowel movements to having 1 every few days. I would take laxatives and it would still not help and would cause a great deal of pain in my stomach. MY PCP said increase fiber,exercise,miralax,etc. I followed those instruction and still no change in bowel habits. In fact, miralax makes my abdominal pain much worse than if I do not use it. I saw a GI specialist who said the same thing and then put me on bentyl (which I later found out through my current GI doc was probably making my abdominal pain worse). I came back to that GI doc after finishing the bentyl with no improvements and was put on linzess. Still no change in bowel movements after 2 months of being on linzess. I did not appreciate how this GI doctor never listened to what I had to say so I switched to a female (who I thought may be more sympathetic and compassionate to another female) GI doctor. I repeated the history of my constipation/IBS issue and was prescribed amitiza (take 2x a day 8mcg each dosing). I began having bowel movements every other day-however I still had to use at least 4 suppositories each day to make a bowel movement occur. I went back for my follow up appointment and reiterated that I still constantly feel like there is a knot in my stomach or a pile of bricks building up in my stomach sometimes making it difficult to breathe. She told me I could take 3 a day (24 mcg) which I began to do. I now have a bowel movement daily but it varies to whether it is liquid or solid or pellets and sometimes it is next to nothing coming out. Also the issue(s) with my insurance is 1. the maximum they will cover is 2 a day 2. I have a $3500.00 deductible and the monthly quantity of 60 (for 2 a day) costs me $286.00 out of pocket each month (and that is after the discount coupon I printed out online) 3. Since 3 a day is the only way I can have bowel movements, I am running out much sooner than my insurance will allow the medication to be filled. Even with 3 a day, I still need to wake up 1 hour than I would have to otherwise for work just so I have enough time to use the now 3 suppositories I need per day to have a bowel movement in the morning. I am in a great amount of pain everyday still-I am constantly bloated with cramps (is this an amitiza side effect?), my stomach is constantly making ""squishy"" , gurggling sounding noises even when I have not eaten recently, It is extrememly painful to sit (which is becoming increasingly difficult because I have a desk job), and I can constantly feel things 'popping"" in my stomach (again side effect of amitiza?). I always with no exceptions feel like I am not emptying myself completely. I have heard of people combining linzess and amitiza -can anyone tell me if they think this will help me since I cannot continue to take 24mcg a day due to insurance and furthermore even taking 24 mcg a day is not making anything more comfortable to me-the only thing it does is create a bowel movement but does not relieve any of the bloating,""popping"" in my stomach, cramping,etc. I'd also like to add I have had multiple X-rays,ultrasounds, and scans-all I have been told is ""all thye reveal is a lot of gas and stool). I should also additionally add since beginning the amitiza I have a real issue with gas-I am constantly emitting gas and the whole reason my GI doctor told me I could take 3 was because maybe it would help relieve the extra gas I was experiencing however I feel it may be worse at 24mcg than 16 mcg). Also, I have gone to the ER on 4 separate occassions due to the intense abdominal pain and have consistently been told ""there is nothing they can do for me-all of my x-rays only show gas and stool). I have had a colonoscopy too where polyps were removed but I was told that they would not have been the cause of my IBS and I think that is accurate because I still have the symptoms and they are worse after the polyps were removed. I am really at my wits end and hope someone can offer some type of advice to improve my quality of life-I don't know how much longer I can go on like this. I am so desperate, please any advice (even if not directly an answer to my question) would be appreciated. "

The best way I can describe it is zombie like. I feel detached and emotionless. I don’t feel happy sad or anything. I don’t see a point socializing, or anything else for that matter. I just see everything in a logical sense. And I don’t like it, I felt the same way when I was put on Add medication in middle school. I don’t feel happy sad scared stressed anxious shy glad excited, when my brother talked to me about possibly doing airsoft I didn’t feel anything, normally that would have excited me even if i was stressed. Is it possible this side effect will go away over time? Or should I find another medication. Don’t get me wrong its not making me depressed, I just feel nothing. I haven’t felt this way since middle school when I was put on an add medication.  (October 27th 11:00PM)  I still feel the side effects, they should have been gone by now i mean heck its been over 22 hours the average duration of a 50mg dose of Zoloft is 22 hours, i took a 25mg. I can't stop crying witch is strange for me, i don't normally cry even when things are really bad, the strangest part is that when i cry i don't feel sad or scared my brain register the fact that i feel sad and scared but i don't feel it in my heart. Its like my heart and mindhave been separated. My mind tells me I'm sad, my face looks like I'm sad when i look in a mirror but i don't feel (FEEL) sad. It should have been gone hours ago. Im going to try to get some rest. (October 28th 9:30PM)  I just woke up around 30 minutes ago. It was strange i didn't recognize myself at first nor my surroundings my brain was just on a tangent of nonsensceicle thoughts and ideas. i was conversing with people who didn't exist. About things that didn't make any sense. I feel a little better now. I still feel sick in my stomach. Id say the only thing that really changed is that now instead of feeling completely numb i feel weird. Jittery, almost light headed. i feel my heart again witch is suppose is good news. but it feels weird almost light. Im starting to feel sick again. My head almost feel like its heavy one moment then full of helium the next. My emotions still feel numb. The nauseas back. I feel like I'm failing in and out of reality, its really strange. Is it possible to be feeling this after only taking the pill one day? Are these side effects normal? Should these side effects be gone by now? How long do you believe it will take for these side effects to subside and leave me feeling normal again? Is it possible that this medication somehow permanently (or in the long term) altered the chemical make up of my brain? Its strange whenever i try to focus on my surroundings and life i get sick, confused and a little scared. When i try to focus on reality i feel a little emotion but when i let myself zone out witch only take second a second it feels like all my emotions have been muted. "

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/zoloft-sertraline-hair-loss-2565865.html,Does Zoloft (sertraline) cause hair loss?,"Hello,  I started on 25 mg of sertraline for one week then took 50mg the next week and the third week I am currently on 75 mg. I noticed my hair falling out ALOT at the end of the second week (while taking 50 mg). I am 23 year old male and have always had thick hair and no one in my family has had any issues with hair loss. The hair that falls out are long strands with the white bulb attached at the end. I have also noticed that my hair appears to be lighter in color and turning almost white at the tips. Also very thin! I used to be prescribed to adderall and that stuff made my hair fall out like crazy when I took it in the same way that it is falling out with the zoloft. I only used the adderall for studying, so when I didn't use the adderall my hair returned to normal and stopped falling out. So I know that the hair loss I'm experiencing is due to the zoloft because it started falling out as soon as the medicine got into my system, my hair was completely fine before I started the zoloft. I feel that the zoloft (sertraline) is starting to work good for my anxiety and I don't want to stop taking it but I want to keep my hair! So my question is, is this hair loss a temporary side effect? Will the hair loss stop once my body gets adjusted to the sertraline (zoloft)? Has anybody else experienced this? If this is just temporary I would definitely be willing to wait it out. "

I was first prescribed venlafaxine a couple months ago for general anxiety and depression. My doctor started me on 37.5 for the first week, told me to double it the next week to see how I felt about that then tripling a couple dosages which I decided I didn't like (felt unlike myself. A lot more jittery and all over the place compared to the single and double dose). Besides yawning every other minute or so, I loved being on it. When I ran out I wasn't sure what to do since it was my first time going to a doctor for my issues and she only prescribed it to see how I would like it first.. so I waited until my next appointment. Worst two weeks ever. I felt like my head was being run over by a semi..my head felt stuffy (which I realized was the norm before being on the pills) and was back to my depressive state. Anyways..I got my prescription again (after being yelled at by my doctor who told me to leave a message next time when I needed a refill lol). She started me back at 37.5 for one week to slowly get me back in track and now I take 75 MG every day for a month now. The yawning doesn't happen as often but is still present. I've noticed I'm not as energetic as I was the first time around when I took them. I can't seem to wake up in the morning and be productive like I was before. I can wake up just in time to get ready for work but that's about it. I notice when I'm on it though, that I don't ""think"" as much (dwell on bad things) but I just experienced a depressive episode. Not suicidal thoughts but more so very sad..and I'm not sure why.  Does anyone have any answers or advice. Is this something that will subside?

I take it for chronic migraines but the side effects are not worth it in my opinion and I'd like to explore some other options for treatment. The reason why I want to stop taking it is because after taking Timolol-Maleate for 4 years I developed an allergy to it and am afraid this will happen again with the propranolol.  I tried several times to get off of Timolol and failed miserably. I attempted to ween myself off of it for about a week. I was only taking a very small dose and it was working well, 10mg 2x per day. I cut that down to 5mg 2x per day over the course of a week but after it being completely removed from taking it for 3 weeks there was something seriously wrong. If I exerted myself physically I would labor to breathe and experienced SEVERE withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms persisted and seemed to get worse the longer I was off of it.  My doctor seems to believe that going off of these beta-blockers are no big deal and you can just ween yourself off for a little while. And perhaps they are but in my case I can't seem to stop taking them without it completely wrecking my body, focus-level and just managing with the withdrawals. My doctor is also insistent that I continue taking a beta-blocker indefinitely even though we are treating migraines and not some serious heart condition. I know that there are other options and quite frankly I don't trust his opinion any longer. Has anyone had this experience? Did I not give it enough time? Am I reducing the dosage incorrectly? Some stats: I'm 29, Healthy (other than chronic migraines), average to under-weight, currently taking 20mg of propranolol 2x per day and would like to be off it entirely, safely. - thanks for any input "

My husband has stones and I have seen the pain he has been in and of course my fear got the better of me. I was literally groaning like I was in labor. I was able to take an 800mg ibuprofen and something for nausea and was able to finally get some rest about 4am. I know that subs can cause difficulty in urination, or produce a shy bladder and I have been taking cranberry concentrate to help with this. My mind took me to the place of 'what if's'. What if this IS a kidney stone? What if I have to go to the ER ? What if I can not get relief due to suboxone? How WILL I get relief? At this moment, I am still unsure as to whether it is/was muscle spasm or stone. My back feels bruised inside and a dull ache. Any advice and tips are greatly appreciated!! Thanks! ~Jillynnie "

I have been treated with many medications in recent years, to include Elavil (Amitriptyline) Nortiptyline, and Topamax; and am also taking Effexor for fibromyalgia. I noticed a year or so after starting the Elavil that I was gaining weight; and this was significant as before this time I was always underweight for the first 26 years of my life; and suddenly gaining almost 25-30 lbs was pretty significant. My doctor stated it could be the Elavil; and placed me on Topamax. (I had taken Topamax years ago but had to stop it due to the fact that it suppressed my appetite; so she said it might be a plus/plus now to help me with my migraines as well as bring my weight back down). However, this time around the symptoms were much worse; I did in fact lose weight, but also suffered from nausea and dizziness; constant tingling in my hands and feet; and other symptoms. So she moved me over to nortriptyline, which was supposed to not have as much of a weight impact. However, I have noticed in the month I've been taking it that the weight has come back, and pretty quickly too; as has my appettie and cravings for sugar and carbs. So my question is is there any sort of migrainie preventative that actually does NOT cause weight AND helps prevent migraines?

The other night, I couldn't sleep. i knew I had a UTI and felt terrible, but dealt with it because I don't trust doctors. Sometimes I can treat it myself with homeopathic remedies and I'm ok,,, but after another sleepless night, I got up around 2 in the morning and felt so dizzy I passed out cold on my kitchen floor. When I came too, my husband was looking over me scared to death, I don't know what happened, but I felt like my BP was skyhigh, so he got scared and called the Ambulance {mistake #!} they came out, and saw I could walk and was alert, so they asked if I wanted to go to the hospital, and my husband convinced me to go. So, I got in the Ambulance feeling very emabressed, and they treated me very badly and told me that I was keeping them from more important duties, I felt like I could've jumped out and walked home. I felt so bad I even apoligized, because I diddn't know what else to say. and I hadn't slept in 2 days. So, I get to the hospital and was greeted by actually a very nice nurse, who was compationate and actually cared.   So, after and urine sample and a bp check {was 184/104} and a 2 hour wait. The doctor came in calling me by my last name, I knew that wasn't good. He said I would not have died from my HBP today, but I would eventually and that wasn't a reason to be there.and then he asked what the problem was and I told him, when he saw I came in by ambulance, he proceeded to tell me that I was a bad person, that someone could have died because I took an ambulance, and that an ambulance ride costs 600$, and then he told me that people die every day because of someone like me and I was ""taxing the system"", When he left I cried so hard that when the nurse came in, she couldn't understand what I was saying. When I finally got it out, she was understanding and said what he said was horrible and she wrote down in my chart what he had said to me and gave me a number to call to complain, when I told my husband and when he picked me up what happened, he immediatly called that person to complain, after he told her she said,""oh no, not again"". So, I hope he got in trouble. I hope I recieve something in the mail for a law suit against him or something but I don't think I would get that lucky. I already don't trust dr anyway, and this confirmed my feelings. I have many diagnosis and I haven't been to my dr for a while because I dont trust any one I have even had. My Grandfather was the lead medical director and an MD at that hospital for 55 years. If he was still alive that dr would've been fired on the spot... so there it is, sorry so long, sometimes I think about it and cry, where is the compassion? What about the hippocratic oath? Its all lost now adays... something needs to be done.. thanks for reading... PS~when I left my BP was 202/126... I left anyway! "

At age 44 I decided to get tested and was diagnosed as having ADHD (of the inattentive type). I've also suffered from anxiety all of my life. Since beginning Adderall XR 15 mg, now 20 mg for 2 months, I have been experiencing muscle pain, cramping/tightening and weakness. Adderall changed my life for the better, (except for the pain if that's the cause). Not thinking that my pain was caused by this med my Dr. began sending me to one specialist after another, a Psychologist, 2 Psychiatrists, a Neuro Surgeon, a Spine Specialist, a Neurologist, and a Rheumatologist. All specialist say there is nothing wrong. I've had a CT scan, 4 MRIs, a nerve test and several X-Rays. All show no abnormalities. I've had 4 months of physical therapy, 1 yr. of Chiropractic care and spent thousands of dollars on in home equipment to ease the pain. Nothing has helped and I refuse to take pain relievers, I don't believe covering up the problem is the answer... Recently, I was told by my Rheumatologist that I had ""Myofacial Pain"". REALLY?! I'm no Dr. but I believe that was the reason WHY I made the appt. to see him. What I'd like to know is the cause of my pain... :/ Needless to say, I'm completely frustrated and becoming increasingly depressed. It hurts to do simple household chores, I rarely leave my home, and out of desperation I spend up to 10 hrs a day on the internet looking for answers. I'm beginning to wonder if the Adderall XR is the cause. Has anyone else experienced these issues while on this med? If so, what ADHD med were you switched to? PLEASE HELP!!!

It is a monophasic pill, and contains 21 active pills and 7 sugar pills. I've been using it for 5 months now and take it at the same time every day, and have never missed an active pill. However, I get migraines (without aura) and am easily affected by hormonal changes, and thus I find the transition from the end of the sugar pill week to new active pills hard. Normally, on the 1st day of a new pack after taking the sugar pills for 7 days, I start to get a migraine and can become fairly nauseous. For the last 2 cycles, I've been taking the 21 active pills religiously, but have only been taking 3-4 of the sugar pills instead of the 7. Instead of taking the last few pills of the sugar pills, I've been throwing them out and instead starting a new pack a few days early. For some reason, this has helped my migraines/headaches. I've tried to run packs together (no placebo week) but have a LOT of breakthrough bleeding. Other than this small flaw, the pill has had no other side effects for me. However, is this safe? Can I shorten my sugar pill week without fear of pregnancy/other health risks? I plan on talking to a doctor very soon about this, but would just like to know if I'm at risk.  Thank you so much! "

At first when it occurred I would make an appointment with my doctor and he would give me a low dose prescription 4 hydrocodone and Valium. This went on for a few years until one time I was basically could not move for 4 hours, I was outside and started to go hypothermic. At this point my doctor wanted me to see a neurosurgeon to see if anything further could be done. The neurosurgeon suggested an MRI , going to pain management, physical therapy and wait it out as long as I could, the longer I could wait before a major operation the better he said. I went to physical therapy, and was admitted 2 a pain management. At first I was hopeful that these would help me to function better. The pain management was very interested in selling there various back injection procedures of which I received approximately 11 injections all various types / approximately 7 different procedures from epidural, 2 some type of RF frequency with four different needles on each side of my spine. None of these gave me very much relief. This pain management was much more interested and selling there shot procedures then helping me to actually feel better. We spent $13,000 in deductibles each year for two years. In all I have had an x-ray a cat-scan 3 MRIS all over a 4 year time frame from 2013 through 2017. Eventually my wife who provides the insurance she is a nurse and works at various hospitals, switched jobs to get better insurance so I could see a different neurosurgeon. Not wanting to wait the full time for the insurance too be activated I opted to pay for another MRI out of pocket, and my first visit to the new neurosurgeon. Upon meeting with him he said that I have two very compressed discs and the only real answer is to have them fused. His procedure went through the abdomen. The Hope also was also that the muscle spasms would be alleviated due to the fact that the back would now be supported well with new proper spacing. Pluses and minuses, the back has been healing now four 3 months, it feels less painful, it feels like it is healing. However I still have a lot of muscle pain with spasms periodically, it is very difficult to walk with my muscles this way. Walking was not as bad for the first few weeks after the surgery as it is now, this is due to the fact that the muscle relaxant has been changed from what worked extremely well for me, Valium, to at first no muscle relaxant, and then pleading with the pain management team at least being able to get Soma, which works but not nearly as well or as long. I have also been on 5 or so different muscle relaxers when I was with the other pain management. The pain management team that I have been with from before the surgery to now said that if I can find a doctor to prescribe the Valium that they would continue to give me 50% of the pain medicine that I have been receiving since they took back over after the surgery. Does anybody know how to get valium? I know I felt much better a month-and-a-half ago then I do now. I feel that I will be on a muscle relaxant for a long time but I do wish to get off these pain meds the sooner the better at this point they don't really take away off lot of pain. I will be going back to physical therapy soon, hopefully it will be better than last time. "

Acne,https://www.drugs.com/answers/epiduo-acne-months-719135.html,I've been on Epiduo for acne for five months. What now?,"Hello everyone, I want to relate my Epiduo experience to you. I was first prescribed Epiduo (apply at night by itself; no moisturizer) in late December 2012. I was 21 at the time. I'm now 22. I had pretty bad acne on my face (for four years), not to mention all the scars and discoloration (which I still have). I had also been prescribed an oral antibiotic to accompany Epiduo, but it caused an ulcerative colitis flareup and a yeast infection, so I had to stop taking it after a month. It didn't help anyway. For the first six weeks I'd say the acne became far worse on the treatment. It was pretty awful. My face burned with the Epiduo cream on, and then when I washed the cream off in the morning my face burned even more, so I put moisturizer on in the morning under my makeup. My face was positively covered with acne, and I had heard about the ""initial breakout phase"" so I just tried to wait it out, but it lasted a lot longer for me. Also, my face was becoming crazily dry and leathery.  After some time (perhaps 6 weeks) the ""initial breakout"" was over and my face returned to the state it had been in before I began Epiduo, which was still pretty bad. I was hoping for better results after six weeks, but I recalled reading that you need to wait three months before any real results can be seen, so I kept waiting.  After four months I would have to say that the majority of those dreadful little whiteheads that covered my chin were gone and those huge pimples that covered my face were become less frequent, but they were still there nevertheless. -- Also, my face was very dry. I looked like I had aged several years with how dry my face was. After five months on the cream (and I'm still on it) I still get pimples, not near as many, but of course, my face is still terribly dry. I hate it. I wasn't expecting a miracle cream, but I really had hoped that it would work better than it has.  Anyway, now that you know my situation I was wondering what I should do now? If I get off of Epiduo will my face become covered with acne again even though it has been five months? There definitely have been results. My face is much clearer than it had been before I began treatment. -- Do I have to stay on this cream forever?  Thanks! Ellie "
Acne,https://www.drugs.com/answers/average-long-doxycycline-clear-cystic-acne-2650625.html,"On average, how long does Doxycycline take to clear up cystic acne?","I'm a 20 year old female who had been struggling with painful, cystic acne since early highschool years. I was once put on doxycycline 100MG when I was 17 and my face seemed to clear up almost immediately, and I was acne free for my senior prom 3 weeks after starting the medication. After now being off the medication for 3 years, I've started to develop cystic acne even worse than what I had before. After seeing my dermatologist, she suggested being put back on doxy since ""it worked before."" Now after 3 months I've seen ZERO improvement and have actually noticed the acne getting worse. I have been taking doxy in conjunction with a benzoyl peroxide face wash to prevent bacterial resistance. Could I be immune to the antibiotic? How long should I wait it out before seeking other options? The embarrassment is getting overwhelming. "

Tri-cyclen Lo has discontinued their entire line of birth control? I called them this week to see why there is a shortage of OTCL. Shock! Was told they have discontinued the manufacture of all birth control! I asked why didn't they inform the pharmacies because the pharmacies just think it is on back-order. Reply was that the pharmacies can find the info on the FDA.com website. I said why would the pharmacies even think to look on the FDA website when they have no reason to believe the product has been discontinued, because you didn't tell them. (there is practically no info about this on FDA.com) Literally all 10 drugstores that I called this week did not know the Jansen BC pills are discontinued and all just thought it was on back-order. Would be nice if the manufacturer would inform the pharmacies so they could inform their customers that they will have to scramble to find an alternative. Big problem finding an alternative because all generics my daughter has ever tried (in order to save money) have caused severe acne within one week! So bad that she kept switching back to the name brand and costing $60 out of pocket per month. Plus I've seen many other users comment how the generics gave them debilitating anxiety, depression, PMS, acne, crying fits and other side effects. The acne is cystic which creates big deep painful acne which leaves permanent scars so this is no joke. We are seriously worried how we will find an alternative that prevents acne. If there is anyone out there that used to take Ortho tri-cyclen Lo and has found an alternative that works just as good as OTCL, please leave a comment. Lastly, how come I don't see anyone else commenting online about this? I'm sure there are many others affected by this discontinuation. Thanks "

Then upped to 300mg. I immediately began itching. After reading neg experienced others wrote about generic, i switched to Brand Wellbutrin on Day 3. Itching continued.

The infection is also sensitive to Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin. The last time I took Cipro it made me nauseated, very dizzy and it felt like my joints were on fire. I also have since developed bilateral tendonitis in my Achilles tendons. I don't know if it is related.

I am new to this PCP (the result of changes in insurance). I do not have history positive or negative with this PCP. I do have a history of recurring UTI's. The UTI's have become a huge problem because of the antibiotic issue.  I have been given to understand that if a patient is sensitive to multiple antibiotics then they are simply out of luck - is this true? I would almost rather try the sulfa and manage the reaction then try the Cipro, but once you tell a physician you are allergic to an antibiotic you are out of luck. "

However, I haven't felt ""normal"" since I had my first attack all those years ago. It keeps me from being who I truly know I am. I don't fear anything other than the fear itself. There are no real world issues that trigger my anxiety. It does what it wants when it wants. Which is everyday. I am in a position where I have relocated and I saw a new doctor. She prescribed Zoloft as a way to help with the anxiety and decrease my dependence on Xanax. I'm living alone right now and I am terrified that I will have a side effect or reaction to Zoloft while I'm in a new city with no family around. On the other hand, I want to feel better as soon as possible. I'm so fed up feeling on edge, foggy like and nervous to do the simplest things. Xanax has alleviated my symptoms over the years but never given me the relief I've been praying for. I absolutely hate taking meds. Nervous to try Zoloft.

Social Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/how-specifically-does-prozac-interfere-with-411569.html,How specifically does prozac interfere with exercise levels?,"21yr old male, switching over from sertraline. Have yet to visit the pharmacy and currently debating if I want to go through with it at all. I refuse to take another ssri with seldom gains that will impair my energy levels and appetite, or even make me sweat uncontrollably when merely sitting at the desk. I understand there are adverse risks to my sex drive, especially for my age; although, it may be a necessary sacrifice in the interest of prolonging cognitive health, or repairing it at the very least. My mood no longer elevates in any which direction as it is discreetly frozen in limbo, and I have no desire to melt away the ice. I've come to terms with the understanding that feeling ""nothing"" is better than feeling ""bad."" I often find myself driving up a mountain alone only to stare at the the skyline and the stars, wondering how different my life could have been. Not to sound narcissistic by any means, but I do feel I am astonishingly resilient for playing the hand I've been dealt in this life, the accuracy behind that statement is constantly reassured by my therapist. I'm a college student with a 3.4 average with plans to transfer this time next fall pursuing health care; perhaps, once I'm officially on my own, all this garbage I'm writing will have been recycled. In short, I'm an active guy and exercise is undoubtedly my preferred method of escape from reality. I take nutrition and fitness seriously as I adamantly believe it has safeguarded me from further, unpredictable punishment at the hands of a bi-polar, demented, neglected, fragment of a home environment.

Social Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/sertraline-work-whatsoever-mirtazapine-trick-2991962.html,Sertraline didn't work whatsoever – will mirtazapine do the trick?,"I was on sertraline for over 8 weeks with absolutely no effects whatsoever – neither side effects nor any noticeable improvement in my social anxiety – despite increasing the dose from 50 mg to 100 mg. Consequently, it was decided that I should try mirtazapine, which is an NaSSA rather than an SSRI, starting off at 15 mg. My doctor seemed convinced that sertraline would work, as apparently it is very rare that people do not respond to sertraline. Does this mean the same is destined to happen with mirtazapine? Maybe if sertraline didn't work, that would mean I'm resistant to all other antidepressants. My social anxiety isn't as severe as in most people, and I've been diagnosed with mild depression. Could it be that I did in fact experience changes when on the sertraline but I just didn't notice because my symptoms aren't as debilitating as the majority's (I don't tend to avoid fear-inducing situations so much but I will still feel rather intense anxiety during them)? Or are you supposed to really notice the effects when they happen? I was thinking that maybe it's just something that happens without you really noticing properly. I took my first mirtazapine tablet last night before bed; I slept all through the night from 10 o'clock but I was already extremely tired anyway due to little sleep the night before. I woke up this morning at 9 still feeling very tired (but I always struggle to get up in the mornings anyway), and throughout today I've felt quite irritable and emotional, and my mouth has tasted rather dry (which I know to be a side effect). Could the tablets be working? I'm concerned I'm just imagining differences in myself that aren't there and which are probably totally normal anyway i.e. it could just be that I'm experiencing the placebo effect. Would I know when the tablets are starting to kick in? Also, does the occurrence of side effects guarantee that the medication will eventually combat the anxiety too? Thanks in advance! "

I have my own UA dipsticks to monitor bacterial growth, so I know when i'm experiencing just a flare up vs. a flare with infection. However, I do have rather severe IC with prominent hemorrhages so I may be more susceptible than others.  I was prescribed nitrofurantoin as a prophylactic antibiotic, but I couldn't tolerate it. I've been taking Cipro when infections occur but I can't help but wonder if it would be best to try another antibiotic like cipro to prevent the infections from happening in the first place.

It started with Zoloft as the first med I ever had to take on a daily basis, then BP meds, then GERD meds, then multiple severe allergies (airborne and foods). I've finally convinced my doctor to take me off of SSRI's and I'm now taking low doses of Wellbutrin XL (150mg) and Buspar (10mg) which I've took at the same time with SSRI's in the past.  I don't feel like after reading other people's experiences that I was weaned off in a proper manner, not as slow as what most people have been. I've went from 20mg Lexapro, down to 10mg for 3 weeks, and then totally cut out now for 6 days. For the past 3-4 days I've been having insane brain zaps that are accompanied by a PVC each time. It's like the brain zap shocks my whole upper body. The PVC's aren't a new thing for me, as I've tried weaning off Lexapro before under a psychiatrist's observation and had the PVC's that freaked me out and I ended up going back on. This time I fought through those when my dose was cut in half (20 to 10) and they stopped after about a week. I'm guessing the recurrence of PVC's is from dropping the dose yet again but they only come along with the brain zaps. Moving my eyes or any fast movement of my head causes brain zaps, sometimes multiple zaps at a time and it's really interfering with my work. I called the doctor after 2 days of dealing with them and she didn't seemed too concerned. I told her I had heard antihistamines had been documented by some to help curb these sensations but it didn't seem to work well for me. When I'm not experiencing these problems (which is rare) I feel like my mind is a lot more clear and I have better focus, but the brain zaps with the PVCs really scare the living crap out of me.  I've read also that taking certain vitamins can help a lot to stop these feelings because they help with whatever the Lexapro was doing to my brain/body, for those chemicals to be naturally created in my body where my brain feels like it's deprived or something along those lines (just trying to be as laymen as possible because I don't remember the technical terminology). If anyone has any suggestions on how to curb these feelings I would love to hear them! Thank you so much in advance! "

I found it semi-painful but the results came back normal apart from the fact that the doctor could see the imprint of my uterus on my bladder meaning it is putting some pressure and can give me the feeling to pee often. He told me to just keep with antibiotics and that there was noting else he can do. Since recovering from the exam, my peeing was normal. Yesterday night was the first time I had sex with my boyfriend in over a week, and right after I went to shower and took my ""after sex pill"" (Nitrofurantoin) and went to sleep. When I woke up and went pee, there was a small burning feeling but thought it was just because it was my first pee of the day. I just went to the bathroom now and the feeling is back. I am so discouraged. I ordered 2 bottles of a supplement containing D-Mannosse and Cranberry as I heard this can help (I am going to pick it up from the post office today). I also ordered 2 bottles of Vitamin B complex, C and D as I heard this can help as well. I am waiting for them to arrive.  Is there anything else I can do or try?

I had my first UTI when I was 19. It was not caused by sex. I was still a virgin. Because I was unfamiliar with UTI's I let it go untreated too long and it turned into a kidney infection. With antibiotics, I was treated and healed within a week. Ever since then I have had multiple UTI's and I am now sexually active. I am also on the depo shot. I get yeast infections quite frequently as well. I would say on average I probably get 5 to 6 UTI's a year. Not all of my urine cultures come back positive but I still am given antibiotics since the symptoms are present. I have been doing more research on UTI's and have discovered that doctors can prescribe you antibiotics with unlimited refills for people who have them often. Why won't my doctor do this? I know the symptoms of a UTI well enough by now that I hate going to the doctor because I know the treatment procedure. All he says is to come in when I feel like I have one. Does he not know how annoying this is?! And when I ask him why I get so many UTI's he just says some women have more bacteria in the body than others. I drink cranberry juice, take cranberry pills, pee before and after sex, I drink lots of water and I still get them a lot. I actually have one right now. I was seen last week and given antibiotics but the macrobid and pyridium didn't work as I need a 2nd dose so I have to call and see what they can do. I'm just wondering if anyone who knows anything about the bladder and UTI's, could tell me what they know and why they might think i get these so much. "
