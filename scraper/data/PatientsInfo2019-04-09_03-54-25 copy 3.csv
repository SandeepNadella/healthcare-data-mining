I do not know if it is related and my GP will not commit to say it is but after Shingles I kept getting episcleritis.I tried Pred Forte which worked well at first but as my bouts of episcleritis increased i was told to stop using it as the pressures in my eyes increased. I then used Acular but it is not nearly as effective. I got steadily more fed up with looking like something out of a horror film 2 weeks out of each month so in despair went to see a nutritionist. She advised me that the episcleritis was a symptom of my immune system being damaged and put me on a course of Vitamin B, Omega 3 fish oil, a general multi vitamin and a pro biotic plus a daily dose of an anti oxidant supplement with vitamins A,C and E. Unless you are pregnant or wanting to be, I think this has made a difference as apaprt from one day of a vague redness (normally it wold last 10) I have not had a recurrence. It seems to be working so I wanted to share this with you. erhaps give it a go. Good luck. 0 likes, 34 replies "

Each time the test result came back normal.  The first I had epislceritis, I was prescribed  with pred forte and arcoxia oral medication by my ophalmologist.  I was totally cleared in about 2 to 3 weeks time.  The 2nd flare up in 2016, same eye drop and oral medication prescribed.  It took me one month or so to completely cleared. The 3rd flare up was recent. I went to different eye doctor, was prescribed Lotemax and synflex 275 mg oral medication for one month. The moment i stop both the lotemax and synflex, the redness return. I was asked to continue for another one month with pred forte and synflex.  The moment i stopped taking synflex said about few days the redness start to come back.  Synflex created a mess in my stomach.

It then started to disappear until I had to take my mum to the hospital and then it returned like a thief in the night.

I hate having it as people comment and It annoys me so I think worrying about what people are thinking when they talk to me also doesn't help with stress. I also won't take anything over the counter for my eye as I feel it'll just make it worse. It's about treating the cause, not the symptoms. I also suffer from athletes foot and gum disease so I know there is another underlying problem here that needs to be addressed. I have also suffered from   in the past too. So I'm going to address my diet, I do exercise regularly anyway, look at some vitamin supplements and also look at addressing my stress levels.

I am  on remission since my last episode in May 2018. I am living with epi since 2013 with no underlying diseases.  I noticed my epi recur on the same left eye early this month.  Is distressing!  This time I use pred forte 4 x  a day, timolo maleate twice daily and arcoxia 90 mg twice daily.  Apart from this,  I am on supplements too.  I take nuvapine A 320 mg , grapeseed 15000 twice daily, ocumin ared eye vitamins, epo with fish oil and red yeast with CQ10. On the third day I can see the redness reduce significantly.   In my last bout, arcoxia 90 mg does not help.   I had to be on oral streoid therapy.   Possibly because of the supplements I take, arcoxia does help this time.   If can take turmeric as well.  Turmeric calm inflammation. I am sharing this hopefully those who are in same condition can give it a try.   As we know, epi has no cure, no prevention and no known cause.  Most ophtalmologists would prescribe oral steroid when all drugs fail.   Steroid is a powerful drug and it control your symtoms and do not heal.   Healing is left to your body's capacities.  Go natural with the right supplement and dose, it helps. I hope someone who battle epi tirelessly would find this sharing a relieve.   All the best. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Now I'm thinking could it be that simple?!?? Vitamin C = Scleritis Gone?? no way! so i decided to google "" vitamin c and Scleritis"" i got a couple of results of just the usual ""these vitamins will help scleritits"" but then i came across a doctor/ophthalmologist form Indiana that claims that he prescribes a High dosages of vitamin C to his patients along with other stuff and some of his patients have even felt relief with in a couple of hours!!  Could it really be that simple??!!?? well I'm going to put it to the test and see if this theory test out! i would drink OJ for the rest of my life if it meant that i didn't have to deal with this pain!

I looked up this doctor, unfortunately he passed away back in may 2017, at 90 something yrs old! The dosages he prescribes of vitamin c are really high...I'm not sure that im going to take the dosages that are that high but i will up my OJ game and see how it goes! i figure it cant hurt me to drink a little extra OJ!

Doctors had me on various steriods for many months.  I didn't react well to it. Got rid of redness but raised my eye pressure. Quack doctor didn't treat my developing glaucoma in time and I lost much of my eye sight in one eye. Two surgeries for glaucoma and Episcleritis kept on recurring. Knew I couldnt rely on steriods.  Tried CBD -- did nothing.  Vaping cannabis however has done the trick. Started 3 or 4 evenings in a row at the first sign of flare up.  Now I'm vaping a couple evenings a week. Found that I have to vape enough to get my eyes red.  Both eyes get red but particularly in the inner corner of one eye where my flare ups normally occurred.  However, once the THC subsides, my eye is clear and remains so.  Can't say I like getting stoned but I've learned to choose times and locations to minimize impacts on my functioning.  I should say that I also have an autoimmune disease (schleroderma) so I may not be typical of other sufferers.   But I'd greatly like to hear results if others try the cannabis route.

I gave birth to my second child and 4 months after began to feel tired and drained, general lack of appetite, shortness of breath, chronic rhinitis and sinus pain and an odd feeling down my upper left! i began getting pains in my stomach, and my weight began to drop.  It was difficult to say what was related to post baby weight loss and what was abnormal.  I felt dreadful.  Then i started suffering with a lump in my throat and difficulty swallowing.  Food was getting stuck in my throat and I felt utterly dreadful. After many visits to my Gp, who suggested I had post natal  , followed by anxiety.  Then the sickness began.  I couldn't eat, felt nausea 24 hours a day!  It was hell.  Despite my protests that I was happy it was just the feeling of lousiness everyday that was wearing me down, I ended up been put on diazepam tablets first.  They over prescribed the dose, I couldn't get out of bed for weeks!  I didn't actually know they were valium, and that they should not just be stopped.  I stopped them and ended up in hospital for a week.  I was vomitting daily.  I had an endoscopy in hospital which I had begged for as I was feeling so ill. It showed nothing! They tried 12 different anti-sickness drugs to stop my vomitting....non of which worked!  By this time, I had lost 2 stone in weight and was convinced I had  .  All the blood works I had done showed nothing, apart from low calcium? They sent me home from hospital and told me to take some more diazapam, I was horrified!  I was so weak I could hardly walk from the weight loss and sickness.   I continued to be sick every day for four months, I laid in bed too weak to move around.  I felt so utterly dreadful i cannot explain! Finally, out of sympathy for me, my GP sent me to an ENT specialist to apparently 'prove' to me that there was nothing wrong with my throat and the difficulty in swallowing i was experiencing was 'all in my head' I recall his 2 line letter to the ENT specialist.  \""this woman is suffering from anxiety please reassure her there is nothing wrong with her throat\""  He smirked at me, numbed my throat and shoved a camera down it.  As a precaution he sent me for a barium swallow! This swallow was the key to my diagnosis....the minute they laid me back on the bed...my whole stomach contents came straight back up on their screens.  I was diagnosed with Gross Reflux and am now waiting to see the Consultant.  I paid privately for the following:-  of stomach and pelvis Ultrasound of Throat Chest X Ray I was put on diazapam, anti depressents (in the end I volunteered to see a pyschiatric nurse just to prove to them I wasn't suffering from PNDepression, Anxiety and anything else!) I had a week in hospital where blood tests and endoscopy showed normal..therefore I was sent home suffering from anxiety - because their little minds could not stretch past test normal test results! I actually began to doubt myself in the end, despite my screams that there was SOMETHING WRONG! I am on 600mg Ranitidine daily and have Pharmeceutical Gaviscon.  It helps but i'm still suffering!  I also take Fortisip nutritional drinks daily to ensure vitamins are absorbed more readily.  My GP hasn't apologised, but now at least he can't blame PND or Anxiety! I sleep with my bed head raised 6 inches, and eat small regular meals.  I drink copious amounts of bottled water only!  I have more of an appetite now, haven't been sick for 3 months.  I still get nausea, chest pain and problems with my throat and swallowing.  I think back to how bad I felt and I can now manage in comparison. Don't underestimate how bad this dreadful Reflux can make you feel.  I was convinced i was going to die I was so weak and poorly! 10 likes, 110 replies "

I have seen two ENT consultants the latter of whom said that a virus was causing too much acid being produced in my stomach and has prescribed two 20mg doses of Opemrazole daily.

Rheumatoid Arthritis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-legs-have-been-aching-for-over-two-years-now--691215,My legs have been aching for over two years now..,"Hello everyone! I have been having problems with my legs the past two years now. I get bad aching legs quite chronically. I get them at night quite often but it also happens during the day.

I just want to repeat again that I also have the aches during the day. I recently had an MRI done with a neurologist to see if maybe it was a lower back problem but I am starting to get suspicious that it could be RA because I often feel very fatigued and just not like myself. I almost feel that flu like or Cold like fatigue often for no reason. My energy levels are really low. The pain reminds me of pain I would have as a child in which I was told it was  .

Reflux Oesophagitis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/gassy-chest-pains-a-constant-feeling-of-needing-to-burp--531104,Gassy chest pains; a constant feeling of needing to burp...,"Hi, I'm not sure if this is the right forum for this, but it seemed the closest bet. Every so often (once a month or so), I experience what I can best describe as gassy chest pains. It's a tight fullness from about the middle of my chest up to the top of my throat (I'm assuming in my esophagus). It feels as if I need to get a good burp out to relieve the discomfort, yet no burp that I can manage is ever enough. The discomfort gradually progresses into radiating waves of significant aching pain (dull in some areas, sharp in others) in the region of my chest/throat that I described. Any amount of swallowing aggravates the pain, which proves to be problematic as my mouth starts producing excess amounts of saliva, which I have to continually expel. The symptoms make it virtually impossible to sleep, if the condition hits at night (which it most often does), and laying down only seems to make the sensations worse. I've found that sitting up or standing while bending forward slightly (as when leaning over a counter, for instance) seem to provide the most positional relief, although it isn't much. If I hold a deep breath when I feel a wave of pain coming, I seem to be able to bear it a little better than if I exhale or breathe normally. The pain and chest/throat discomfort usually last a good few hours. Once the pain does subside, I'm usually left with a knotted feeling in the pit of my stomach for the better part of a day. Since it began occurring more than a few times, I started keeping a log of things I've eaten before the symptoms began. Some recurring foods that may have triggered episodes include fatty red meats, chocolate, and (maybe) dairy. In researching such symptoms/triggers, I found myself reading about GERD, and at first thought that might be what I had. But the pains I experience are achey, not burning or acidy, as described as the symptoms of GERD. I've tried taking Tums, Alka-Seltzer, Gas-X, and drinking warm water when episodes begin, but nothing seems to help, other than time. I know that stress can cause/aggravate such symptoms as well, and in some of my instances that might have played a role, but in others, some of the worst, I felt totally at ease before the symptoms flared up. I'll be the first to admit that I don't have the best diet in the world. While I don't eat a lot of fast food, I also don't get as many fruits and vegetables as I should be having daily (especially fruit). I don't know if that would play any role here. I do take a daily multivitamin supplement. Also, I do have a pre-existing heart condition (ventricular leakage after balloon valvuloplasty for pulmonary stenosis that I had as a child), but I don't see how that would be related to this matter, as I doubt any heart-related issues would be associated with the urge to burp. And I am a 30 year old male. I know that other people's issues are much more serious, but man, these conditions are quite unpleasant when they occur. Any opinions/insights as to what I might be experiencing, and how to treat or, better yet, prevent it, would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! 6 likes, 76 replies "

I have been suffering from the symptoms mentioned on here for about 6 years now. Just to give you a short overview, will keep it short: I am living in South Africa, 29 years old, male, problem started with an irritating cough & constant throat clearing & got   but not too often. Started getting upper airway infections & decided to go to doctor that diagnosed me with Asthma. After I started using the   the sore throat became more apparent but my cough stopped. Decided to stop using inhalers but problem just got worse and worse over the years. Daily symptoms now include sticky white mucus in back of throat, post nasal drip, sore / burning throat, constant throat clearing, hoarseness in voice, throat clearing after eating (does not matter what I eat), blocked noise, sinus infections, etc. I have been on all sorts of medication, nasal sprays,  , Cortisone's. I have been to 2 different ENT's, had sinus surgery (which made it worse), been to 2 different allergists, seen many GP's & a homeopathic doctor & no relief. The latest thing I have done is the G-scope after reading about LPR & doc advised that all seems normal. I have tried nexium & now use another med for reflux. My work also involves speaking a lot so I suffer more at work than at home. I dont drink or smoke either. I have traveled to other countries & the symptoms still continue. My question is to those who suffer from this, do you have lots of stress, have you suffered some sort of trauma before symptoms started, do you have an active job or are you sitting at a desk all day? Also, I haven't manged to find any forums like this for South Africans, so if there are anybody in SA reading this with these symptoms please make contact.

Symptoms similar to ptsd.,"Hello, I was prescribed prilosec approximately 3 years ago for the symptoms of gerd. Since then, I've noticed a gradual deterioration in my health. The symptoms I've been having include, but are not limited to severe   and irritability, major  , feeling of fear and dread, visual/eye focus issues, extreme sensitivity to light, and a complete inability to relax, similar to ptsd symptoms. (Among others). I've searched the Internet and have gone through rigorous testing to figure out what could have brought all of this on as I have always had slight anxiety, but nothing compared to what I've gone through over the past 3 years. I could go on and on, but to make a long story short, I did a thorough check of all medications that I was taking (4). I further narrowed it down to prilosec, and began researching for myself. After noticing that there are so many others that have the exact same side effects did I realize that prilosec must be the culprit, especially since that seems to be the exact amount of time that I have been going through what has been a complete nightmare. I immediately stopped taking prilosec cold turkey and went to my gp for a full blood count and had all vitamin levels checked. The results showed that I am now deficient in vitamins d and b12. I I have been off of prilosec for three weeks and taking supplements and have been feeling better, although not nearly 100% at this point. Has anybody had similar adverse reactions to prilosec or ppi's and if so, how long did you take it and how long did it take for you to feel ""back to normal""?

About 1 1/2 years ago I had very similar symptoms.  pain when I swallowed on the left side which involved the ear too.  I could drink and Icy type treat drink and it would feel better.  My GP treated me for ear infections 3 times antibiotics and said I had wax and flushed my ear.  None of that helped.  The throat thing continued so I went to an ENT and had the scope thing through my nose.  He said everything looked fine just that side was a little bit irritated.  He told me to take omeprazole for about 3 months and try not to think about it too much and come back if it wasnt better.  Well I only took the medicine for a couple of weeks and decided to cut the acidic foods out instead.  It did get better.  It is back.  Mostly just my left side throat whenever I swallow.  Sometimes it feels like a strained muscular like pain.  Sometimes it is higher or lower in my throat. I was going through a lot of stress last week before it started.  I dont know if that is related or not.  If I put a little pressure on that side of my neck when I swallow it wont hurt.  It does not hurt to push on it.  I know that my neck and shoulders are pretty tense probably from worrying that its something bad.  Anybody else notice this with the reflux?

I was diagnosed with GERD about 1 month ago after my ENT Doc put a tube camera down my nose, but I now realize GERD is a condition I’ve had since my early 20’s. In October of 2018, I had my right lower wisdom tooth and back molar removed, and that caused major complications with my health, leading me to hospital for sickness 12/18/18 and 12/26/18, X-ray, thoracic CT scan performed as doctors thought I may have had some type of lung cancer. Fast forward to today, I’m still “feeling off”, have developed anxiety (which I’ve never known) and am convinced that my current symptoms (daily pain in my throat/chest/esophagus/trachea, hoarse voice at social events, daily GERD, and feeling “off”) can be nothing but “esophageal cancer”... and I’m totally freaking myself out... I have an endoscopy with GI Doc scheduled for 5/9/19. (I also have a tumor (lipoma), diagnosed 2/18/19, being removed next week. And I’m scheduled for dental implants to replace the tooth in May as well, after endoscopy)(My career is hi stress/pressure too, as I’m sure all people are)..... Any insight here is appreciated.

It feels like I physically can't take a deep breath, all the time - 24/7, no matter what I am doing. This issue started when I turned 19, my sophomore year in college. I have had a chest x-ray, an EKG, an ECHO. I have had my hormones and thyroid levels checked. I have gone to an asthma-allergy doctor. I have seen a psychiatrist and tried 9 different medications for anxiety. I have seen a counselor for a year and a half and have not found anything that helps or any answers. I do not identify with Generalized anxiety due to the simple fact that this issue persists all of the time, even when I am (or should be) at my most relaxed. I have been told that it seems like my brain has been re-wired and almost stuck in ""fight mode"" (fight-or-flight) which I could see as a possibility. I am currently trying biofeedback/ neurofeedback, which I am optimistic about.  I just want to see if anyone has had a similar issue or has any suggestions.  3 likes, 93 replies "

Respiratory Symptoms and Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/what-can-i-do-muscular-dystrophy-breathing-difficulties-691936,"What can I do, muscular dystrophy & breathing difficulties","Hello everyone, I registered on these forums in an effort to find out any answers and advise how I can get the right help. Background information. Since an early age, before 5-years old I have been in/out of hospitals with various health issues, most not serious enough to hamper my quality of life. But a few years back (4-5 years) I started to feel weak in the muscles and this soon progressed to unable to walk which put me in a wheelchair since then, and progressively my body and muscle became weaker, with in-ability to walk because had no strength in the legs was also followed by my arms not been able to lift them or used them. My finger movements have remained somewhat, but now getting to stage with limited mobility soon affecting them. Doctors have performed countless tests including, blood, mucus, gene testing among others, but have not been able to diagnose my disease, both my parents are not showing any gene defects. Doctors have said: A   can be done to determine any changes in my condition and see muscle cell structure. i.e. cells with little dots can indicate a certain type of disease that is seen, but this is unlikely to yield results as my muscles have deteriorate to a stage that catching the type of disease early enough is long gone. There are thousands of patients throughout the world with similar symptoms, they tell me, which gives me no comfort at all, nor does it provide any answers. They says, Laboratories across the world have conducted tests/analysis on these patients, but cant determine what type of disease it is. It is not an ""inflammatory type disease"" as the outcome to the patients health will be a faster rate of decline to their health, which leads to the ""pulmonary specialists"" to lean towards a genetics disease, even though my parents don’t currently show any type of genetic defects. This is not to say that medical improvements in the future will be able to detect a gene defect. So looking else where for any specialists and medical experts/medical advise that I can reach out through social media or web forums like yours else for answers. I know its a long-shot, but I have nothing to lose by trying. I hope someone has info on possible ways to diagnose what my disease is and not tell me its an ""unknown disease"", when we are nearly in the 2020's and you hope medical sciences and studies can be done on patients to get somewhere.

Respiratory Symptoms and Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/the-solution-excessive-yawning-and-constant-need-to-breathe-deep--603214,The SOLUTION: Excessive Yawning and Constant Need to Breathe Deep!,"All, Flutterbypie started this thread and there have been hundreds of responses:  I needed a way to get my message out to everyone and thus wanted to start a new post. Many people suffer from this ailment which causes people to contantly (usually in 4-7 minute intervals) to take a deep breath in order to just ""trigger"" that satisfying feeling in their upper lungs. But it's not that simple, because sometimes that feeling doesn't come. And we keep forcing that deep breath, trying to get the satisfaction - a forced yawn, contortion of the body, whatever it will take. It always comes eventually, but the cycle starts over. We all say it's worse when we eat. We all say it's not a problem while sleeping. We all say it goes away at times when we are heavily focused on something.  Trust me, I HAD it for almost 2 years, and it wasn't just once in a while. I literally had this thing NON STOP EVERY DAY until a few weeks ago. One caveat before I say what I did - I've talked to many people with this condition, and it's true it's not a one size fits all solution - some have hiatial hernias, others have GERD, and I'm sure others have other conditions that cause it. But if you have any inkling of a thought that it could be anxiety, keep reading. The reason why you will never hear someone say ""here's the cure for it"" is because it's not that simple. But I'll just throw it out there right now. YES IT'S A COMBINATION OF ANXIETY AND LIFESTYLE. STOP seeing doctors (again, caveat - unless you think it might not be anxiety per the above), STOP reading on the internet about what people do to fix it (pepto bismal, breathing exercises, just STOP). It's ANXIETY AND LIFESTYLE. And I didn't believe it either because, sure I was anxious about a few things every now and then (who isn't?), but this thing lurks around all day even though you don't think you are particularly anxious. But I guarantee there are things you are anxious about. For me, and I bet for many of you, I was anxious about my overall health. Why wouldn't I be? I was grasping for a satisfying breath every few minutes thinking this must be the end, so it makes sense. But I did something drastic, and I admit that I am a little bit in shock that it ACTUALLY worked! I completely turned my lifestyle upside down. I am not suggesting all of you are fast food junkies, but I was. I wasn't obese (196 weight 5'10 male) but I could stand to lose 20-25 pounds. I was drinking coffee, diet coke, some water here and there - but burgers, fried foods, some good foods here and there - ZERO exercise. My waist was 38 and I remember it being a 36 for years, so this was a relatively sudden expansion.  For the past three weeks (which isn't long), I've 100% cut out: 1) Caffeine and carbonated drinks 2) Soda 3) Fast food 4) Fried foods And added: 1) Vegetables and fruits to diet 2) Exercised vigorously on an eliptycal for 20 min a day As time went on and my weight dropped (now at 190.3), the need to deep breath almost exponentially vanished. I still breath deep every now and then mind you, but you have to remember, everyone breathes deep every now and then. I talked to a doctor who said people breath deep once every 20 minutes. But we are hyper focused on it, so we will think ""Oh geez, it's back"". It's not. I never in a million years thought I would beat this thing, especially as quickly as I did, and a couple people I know did a massive lifestyle change and they said things look better. I wish this worked for everyone, and I'm sure there will be someone who says ""but I am super fit and already eat well"". You might have a different issue, OR, it is still anxiety but as I said - I was nervous about my health - now that my blood pressure has visibly dropped and I'm sure my cholesterol levels have too - I am NOT SO NERVOUS ABOUT IT and that's why my deep breathing went away. So you need to find out what you worried about and address it. I hope this helps folks, and it can't hurt to try this if you think you might be worried about your health. I also feel there's a component of your stomach expanding (from food, extra fat around waist, etc.) that changes your breathing patterns - I don't know if it's more that or anxiety, but I don't really care as this works. Please do try it for a couple of weeks and let me know how it goes! Again as a final disclaimer: I am not a doctor so if your deep breathing is totally unrelated to anxiety or diet/lifestyle, then you should definitely get it checked out. I can speak for myself, and many others, we've had our fair share of doctors and there's nothing they can give you to fix it. You need to fix it yourself and I am living proof that I was able to beat it! Good luck! 7 likes, 91 replies "

I was told by my very first specialist I had a negative prognosis. I was told if the trends of exacerbations continue I wouldn't make it to my 21st birthday. At that time I was non-compliant, whereas I have been now for the past year and a half and still have frequent admissions, and even more frequent ICU admissions. I'm on mepolizumab which has decreased how many exacerbations to maybe 1 every 2/3 months. I'm now nearly 20. The exacerbations are becoming increasingly more severe, I've been on Bi-pap and in ICU every time for the past 5/6 admissions. Luckily never tubed. Also, I go into acidosis every single exacerbation now (lactate levels always between 10 & 15, I don't know exactly what units it is in though). IV   don't help in a hospital setting now, only adrenaline, ketamine (to relax the airways) and back-to-back salbutamol nebulisers get me past the worst of it. I'm never particularly hypoxic, so the acidosis is relative to the medications and breathing effort rather than hypoxia itself. Lately also, my hair has been starting to fall out significantly more, my weight will fluctuate by about 10kgs every couple weeks. I have also been increasingly more fatgiued and ""air-hungry"" day-to-day. It makes it harder to keep my O2 sats above 90% during exacerbation. I'm usually quite good at maintaining good sats despite how bad my condition gets, I just force my body to push through how hard it is to breathe till I genuinely have 0 energy left and my breath just quivers from my muscles shaking. The time it takes my body to get to that point and crash is getting shorter and shorter. I'm getting scared. I'm not even 20 years old. I was going into nursing & midwifery next year. I wanted to get into emergency medicine. I feel so, so defeated. It's having a sense of impending doom, but for a legitimate reason. I'm struggling to cope with the idea of me deteriorating. I'm already on 20mg lexapro (which has helped) but the reality of everything is becoming more apparent. I'm not quite sure if I have more options out there for treatment?

Respiratory Symptoms and Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/years-long-symptoms-698132,Years-Long Symptoms,"Hi everyone! So I am 21 years old and I have been having this problem since I believe 2013. It all started after getting over a cold in December of 2013, when I realized I had to constantly clear my throat. It felt like mucus was constantly there, needing to be cleared out by coughing. I still have this feeling to this day, and have had it every day since then. I can’t even sit through a movie without the need to clear my throat several times. It’s not bad when I wake up, but progressively gets worse throughout the day. I’ve been to the allergist and gotten tested yet it came back completely negative, and went to the ENT and they said it was post nasal drip from  . I sneeze a lot so I take an OTC allergy pill every day to suppress that, but it doesn’t help at all with my coughing. A lot of the time I can feel mucus in my throat and kinda of just bring it up and spit it out, which is disgusting but it makes me feel so much better. I just don’t know what to do anymore about this and it’s been going on for so many years. 0 likes, 0 replies "
Respiratory Symptoms and Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/mysterious-chronic-shortness-of-breath-660193,Mysterious chronic shortness of breath,"I will try to make this as short as possible, but this has been going on for over 5 years, so it might be farily long.  Beginning in summer of 2012, I began having shortness of breath (SOB) with no other symptoms. I felt a constant need to yawn, and every few breaths wouldn't satisfy the SOB. I would take a deep breath, and felt like it would get ""stuck"" before satisfying the air hunger feeling. About every 3-5 deep breaths would satisfy it, only for it to return a minute later.  I got an endoscopy and other tests done, which revealed that I had some esophageal erosion due to acid reflux and a slight hiatal hernia and was diagnosed with GERD. I had always have bad heartburn, so I was prescribed with Prilosec, which I have been taking daily since them. I've tried stopping it a few times but the reflux always comes back a lot worse.  Lung tests and x-rays were normal. Heart tests normal. Blood test revealed a slight anemia but otherwise pretty normal.  I did some research reading forums where someone suggested taking vitamin B-12. Strangely, I took it and the SOB disappeared almost instantly. However, it only lasted a few days for it to return just as bad. I then started taking an iron supplement, which again made the SOB disappear quickly- same thing; symptom returned days later.  After further research, I came across a breathing exercise method called the Buteyko method. Essentially you do a lot of breath holding to build up CO2 and reduce breathing as the theory is that I had chronic hyperventilation causing too much CO2 to exit my body. After applying the method and reducing my breathing, the SOB disappeared after only 2 days and I felt completely normal. I continued the method a few more days then no longer felt the need to pursue the exercises. I was normal for a whole year when the SOB once again returned with some chest tightness. I applied the method again and the symptom went away, this time with a little more effort; after about 3 weeks. I included physical exercise which also helped with my breathing.  After that, I was normal for about 2 years. I mistakenly stopped or at least slowed down exercise and the SOB returned once again. I applied the method and began running for exercise but the SOB kept getting worse. It got so bad, I had multiple panic attacks and the feeling of completely empty lungs with the inability to satisfy it with deep breaths. I had to stop exercise altogether, apply the Buteyko method and do breathing exercises very carefully with very light and slow exercise. This helped, but it took many weeks for the SOB to improve. Then, it was almost normal when over a year ago as I was running, I couldn't get a deep breath to satisfy exercise-induced SOB. I have had SOB continuously since then (a year and a half).  I once again started doing breathing exercises and slowly building up physical exercise, but I can't do any prolonged cardio activity because the SOB gets to a point where deep breathing will not satisfy it. While the breathing exercises have helped, they have had very little effect compared to previous efforts. It seems that every time the symptom returned, greater effort yields few results. I suspect there is something, some underlying cause that is causing the SOB that has alluded me this entire time.  So for the past few months to a year, the SOB is worse on some days, better on others, but never gone. There's no rhyme or reason or pattern for it. It's just there, sometimes affecting my sleep. I sometimes can't get a deep breath to satisfy it every now and then, but for the most part, a big gulp of air will satisfy it. But it returns seconds to minutes later. It's as though every breath doesn't deliver what it's supposed to, the SOB builds up, and then I have to take a big gulp of air to get rid of the feeling, pattern repeats. My breathing pattern is normal, however. I don't feel like anything physical is happening, but sometimes it feels like my airways and nostrils are slightly inflamed due to allergies, but when I don't feel inflammation the SOB is still there.  Recent lung function tests show normal- I don't have asthma, or any other problems with my lungs. Heart tests are normal though I did have about a two week bout of heart palpitations which came and went. Haven't had any for a while- it just mysteriously started happening then stopped. Blood tests are normal, though tests always show a slight elevation of biliruben which my doc thinks is Gilbert's disease.  I don't have sleep apnea (normal test), bloody oxygenation is normal, heart rate normal.  Everything else is normal. Emotionally I'm normal- no anxiety, depression, etc. The SOB seems to be the only symptom of something, but always comes back worse, until a year and half ago when it came back and has remained since. I have inflamed sinuses which makes my SOB a little worse, but even when they're clear, the SOB is still there. I feel like I shouldn't have to do breath holding exercises every day just to maintain my breathing well enough to do every day things.  Does anyone have any idea of a possible underlying cause? 0 likes, 1 reply "

The issue is that this breath or yawn isn't always satisfying so I am  constantly taking a deep breath or yawning. I had this issue when I was younger though it went away instantly, this time however it has stuck around and I am in fear that its here to permanently stay. The last 10 months have been absolutely horrible. Some days are better than others, there are times where i don't feel the issue (at the gym, when out with friends). But for the past 3 weeks it has been absolutely unbearable. i feel embarrassed when outside as i think people are often judging my deep breathing. My job requires me to talk on the phone for 6 hours so you can imagine how unbearable this feeling is. I just need advice/help.Anyone out there who has gone through this or is going through it what helps? Will it ever stop?

I remember the first night I got the crawling sensation about 5 years ago. It was the night before I moved away to college and I was nervous so naturally I assumed it was related to my anxiety. Then I started noticing it come back every few months, sometimes for a few days at a time and sometimes a few weeks at a time. Trust me I have looked up the symptoms of RLS and am almost positive I have it. I think my case has been relatively mild although I have had some horrible nights here and there. I went to a foot doctor due to an ankle sprain recently and mentioned to him that I thought I have RLS. He basically laughed at me and told me that RLS is more serious than what I am describing and that the feeling I’m getting before bed is probably because my ankles/calves are tired from using them during the day. Now, I AM currently 80lbs overweight due to a hormonal disorder, BUT I’m young and have strong legs, so I’m not sure I’m buying this whole “tired” nonsense (although that thought is promising). Plus, even if I’m at home being a bum all day, the crawling sensation will come at night, sometimes even worse! Has anyone ever been told this and could he be right? Or could it be related to my anxiety disorder and hormonal syndrome?  I’m beginning to worry as I’ve read that RLS only gets worse with age. The only thing that works for me right now is elevating my legs with a foam roller and rolling out my calves.

I have several health issues, one I'm working on right now too hopefully resolve or get relief from is my RLS. I have been experiencing RLS symptoms most of my life, even as a child waking up with leg pains Etc. This past 2 years it has gotten very severe, I will wake up with my legs stretched so tight that they spasm. This can happen anywhere from 1 to 8 times a night. Every 6 weeks to 8 weeks I will have a spasm so severe that I passed out on my floor, and I have on a couple occasions even had incontinence. Hell of a way to wake up.   My arms are affected too sometimes, not as often but when they do decide to become involved, they will start straight up above my head over and over throughout the night. There are times I will just get up at 3 a.m. and call it a night. I have an appointment coming up with a neurologist in about a week, my doctor has given me a temporary dose of clonazepam. A small dose, it seems to help with the spasms, I have still had a few. I do still tend to wake up, not as often and I'm able to go back to sleep really fast. I had tried mirapex, was up for 3 nights straight, had some other side effects, it definitely did not agree with me. I do have a low ferritin level, my doctor I have does not think that is an issue I'm hoping the neurologist will think differently. Everything I've read says that low ferritin can make restless leg worse. This past month I tore my achilles tendon, I'm wondering if perhaps it is from having spasms that have tightened my calf muscles so much that it led to a tear. I don't know for sure, I walked on it for quite a while before I went in to get it checked, it just seemed like one more thing I did not want to deal with. I am now wearing a boot during the day, which helps extremely for the pain. I'm just wondering if the tear could be from having tight calf muscles from having spasms throughout the night. Would really like other people's insight different medications they have used and things they have done for RLS.

Did not want to use medications due to side effects. So during those sleepless nights I  scoured the internet for some relief. I stumbled across a site for essential oils. What I found were recipes for rls relief so I could sleep, I thought what do I have to lose. Picked up the oils at a store that does the mixing for me, Escents Aromatherapy Canada. Along with 300mg Calcium citrate, 1-1 magnesium. Grape seed oil 100ml, lavender 16 drops, cypress 16 drops, lemon 12 drops, rosemary 12 drops, and juniper berry 8 drops. Massaged oil into my leg and wore a heating pad for 30 min. In the evening. Massaged oil once again into my leg just before bedtime and took one pill of the calcium citrate. I slept like a baby no leg activity or pain at all during the night, I was so ecstatic I did the happy dance, I will continue doing this nightly because the oils are not harmful to me and the calcium/magnesium are also part of my new healthy plan to sleep better. Had to share and hoping this works for you as well, too all a good sleep. 0 likes, 6 replies "

Restless Legs Syndrome,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/ferritin-level-and-rls-686692,Ferritin level and RLS,"Recently I have read that RLS patients can benefit from a much higher ferritin level than ""other people"" It has been reported that raising the ferritin level to higher than 300 can remove the symptoms of RLS completely in some patients and significantly in others.   This is according to work done by Johns Hopkins in the USA. I have been on iron biglycinate for years trying to improve my iron and ferritin has crept up from about 85 to about 108.   The article said that oral iron would be too slow to be effective in a meaningful time. I decided that there was nothing much to lose by doing what they do so I have just had an iron infusion which means intra venous iron.     These are common for anemic patients but almost unheard of in Australia for RLS patients. Note that the normal range of ferritin as quoted by one large pathology lab is 30 to 500.   Hence 300 is not pushing any iron overload limits. I had to visit 5 GPs before I found one to really support my request for an iron infusion.   She was good and contacted several specialists until she found one who was not opposed to an iron infusion as treatment for RLS.  I visited the specialist and within a week I had the infusion.   Because I was not anemic I had to use a private hospital so I had to pay the health insurance excess of AUD500.   I have read of someone in Queensland, Australia who had it done free on his insurance so it might depend on your insurance cover, your doctor or the state you live in. I am now waiting to see what happens.   I understand that I might have to wait 12 weeks to see success or declare it a failure. I would suggest that anyone with RLS investigates this possible treatment.   Whether it works for me or not is not significant to anyone else      It works for some people.   I have been told that it offers total relief to about 50% of patients but there are better and worse numbers floating around. A couple of the GPs referred to high risks in the infusion.    They couldn't be specific but they variously told me that the risk was infection at the point of penetration and ""other things"" that I couldn't get them to specify.   The specialist told me it was no higher for me that for an anemic patient.     There is a very low possibility of anaphylactic shock and that is why it is recommended that you get the treatment done in a hospital or medical facility where they are prepared to handle that low chance event.   The hospital told me they do about 20 - 30 infusions per day and there are many other places doing the same thing. One specialist said ""You should also be aware that only certain iron formulations (INFeD and Injectafer) are beneficial for RLS patients.    Make sure your doctor understands this point."" (Note Injectafer is called something similar but different outside the US) I would strongly suggest that its worth talking to your GP about this and asking her to ring around specialists to get an opinion and find somewhere to get the treatment done.   Your GP might want to read the following report. “Evidence-based and consensus clinical practice guidelines for the iron treatment of  /Willis-Ekbom disease in adults and children: an IRLSSG task force report” Richard P.

It started about 3 years ago when I was 20, when both of my knees we're in so much pain and so stiff I could barely walk. This went after a few days and came back again a year later, exactly the same and at the same time of year. I finally saw a DR a few months ago when I realised something more serious could be up. In my most recent flare it spread everywhere - from my knees to my ankles, hips, elbows, hands, shoulders and neck. I last had a flare up about 4 months ago, which was the worst one ever. It seems my flare ups are spreading throughout my body, are much more frequent, longer in duration, and much more painful. I am so fatigued throughout the day it almost feels like I have flu, and during my last flare up I could barely walk enough to leave the house for over a week. And it's happening again - a few days before my final exams!  My DR is referring me to see a specialist after some   come back. I stupidly left it months before getting the blood test because I was out of the flare up... Alas I regret this now as I could have this sorted already, but I didn't think I would flare up again so quickly. But as soon as these are back I will be referred. The two DRs I spoke to said they are 'fairly certain' it's RA as I'm a textbook example but they are unable to give me an official diagnosis until I see a specialist and other things are ruled out.  I'm just feeling in limbo right now as I don't have a diagnosis yet, have no treatment for this other than   (which do not work), I'm in pain everywhere, and again having difficulty walking.  Are there any other young people out there who have been diagnosed? How do you manage to carry on doing your usual stuff when in a flare up, like uni/work? Is there anything you recommend which could help my ability to walk?

The last time I had it laid me out for 4 months.  I very nearly died once of it.  So, in an effort to dry myself out of the fluid I felt accumulating, I decided to try a FAST. I created a fish broth that I could have with coffee and tea. I started thinking I'd try it for 3 days or so. Well, the first 48 hours is the hardest then it became pretty easy.  It was so easy, I challenged myself to keep going until I really couldn't go on. Day 10 I ate a little chicken salad-maybe 1/2 cup, and went back to the fast until Day 13. I ate a couple of scrambled eggs then returned to fast. I finally stopped on day 17.  And I felt great!  My fluid had disappeared. I lost 20 pounds-all fluid, Im sure but who cares! I felt great. After that, I started 1MAD for about 6 months. I'm going to clean out my freezer and make my soup broth and go to 1MAD.  Im going to eliminate wheat, all dairy, nuts.

In August last year I had bad sinusitis that lasted around 6 months before clearing up. Since then however, i've been experiencing fatigue, stuffy nose (worse at night when lying down) where it feels mostly blocked / congested,  , loud constant   (hissing). I have seen an ENT and he looked at my nose and diagnosed vasomotor rhinitis and said that I would need to get a septoplasty, turbinate reduction and tonsils removed (tonsils are large grade 3.5 but not infected). I have tried a number of things, including   (they don't work), pretty much every nasal spray you can think of (most don't work). When I kind of lift next to my nostrils up quite a bit it does give me some relief but short lived when i let it go back down. The only nasal spray that seems to work is xylometazoline but I can't take that for more than 3 days. I really can't understand what could be the root cause of this. I thought maybe it could be some kind of dust allergy but i've had our mattress and pillows cleaned professionally for dust mites. It just constantly feels like i'm breathing at about 40-50% of the normal capacity (if that makes sense). Thanks. 0 likes, 6 replies "

Rhinitis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/blocked-nose-possible-mold-allergy-sick-building-syndrome-rhinitis--680854,"Blocked nose, possible mold allergy - sick building syndrome? Rhinitis? ","Hi Everyone, I'm trying to find people in similar situations that are either dealing better than I am, have some treatment that is working or have come out the other side. Before reading about my symptoms I believe its relevant to point out that I bought my house just over 7 years ago. My house has a cellar and only original floorboards separating the cellar to my living area (with half inch gaps between each board). I also have found black mold in other areas of my home. I didn't catch onto this/piece together until recently. My issue started around 6.5 years ago when I was diagnosed with M.E or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I suffered from extreme tiredness, sensitivity to light, muscle and joint pain, brain fog and confusion. I then later got diagnosed with acid reflux. Around 5.5 years ago I caught a cold and took a small blow to the nose at the same time. This resulted in difficultly breathing and a permanently blocked nose. I went to the doctors more times than I care to remember, they said everything looked fine but eventually got referred to an ENT after much pressure! I was on antihistamines and a nasal steroid spray too. The ENT took one look and diagnosed me with a deviated septum, enlarged turbinates and a bone spur all blocking my breathing. My first surgery saw the ENT trim my turbinates, reposition and reshape them. I was desperate for this to work but it didn't. I got some light relief and the issue mainly stayed in one nostril. Time went on and I had another surgery around 12-15 months later. This time a probe inserted to heat the turbinate tissue and reduce their size. I had more luck with this but still have a really blocked nose and little quality of life. Recently I caught the flu and ended up with pressure in my ears that won't go away. I have had an allergy test in the past and the results were cat dander, grass pollen, dust mites and mold. I did have two cats but these were rehomed to another family member and I have had no improvement. I think that my issue may have been caused from breathing in damp for a long period of time? I had no allergic symptoms for the 18 months before my nose blocked. Could this be mold poisioning or simply a severe allergy? I would assume I'd have had an initial reaction to it when I first moved in. Has anyone been treated for allergies with enlarged turbinates are actually recovered? I think we are going to move house to see if that helps too. I have asked for a referral to an allergist to see if this can help in any way. the last 6 years of my life have been hell. I've lost friends, upset family, lost a partner due to my inability to cope. I feared empty nose syndrome for a long time due to the two surgeries too. Update: last week I purchased two air purifiers with HEPA filters and I had my best week in the 6 years I have mentioned. This was however short lived and I now feel worse than ever again. Could this be an allergy and can it still get better? Please advise or share similar experiences. Hopefully there is a success story out there 0 likes, 13 replies "
Rhinitis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/devastatingly-swollen-turbinates-641087,Devastatingly swollen turbinates,"I have been suffering from perennial allergic rhinitis for at least 8 years. I am 21 and I am studying computer science. My turbinates are extremely swollen. The swelling is present during the whole year, regardless of the season. It gets a lot worse in the most of the indoor places. Postnasal drip is present when turbinates are swollen, but I don't have problems with runny nose. I also don't have problems with sneezing or itchy eyes. I kindly ask you not to post comments if you also suffer from runny nose. I ask that because always when I found someone with a condition same as mine, the discussion was filled with comments from people suffering from other rhinitis symptoms besides swollen turbinates, especially from people with runny noses. I have compassion for you, but trust me, this is different. Places where my condition is the worst are caffe bars and cheap restaurants with poor ventilation. My turbinates become swollen almost immediately after I enter these places, it takes only a few seconds. After leaving those places and getting some fresh air, I immediately feel partial relief, but not completely, I suspect that's because the allergen remains present on my skin. Condition also gets worse in many other indoor places, such as my apartment and college classrooms. We recently did a detailed cleaning of the apartment, especially my bedroom. Soon after that, my condition became a bit better (not dramatically) both at home and at other places where it usually gets worse. But that small improvement only lasted couple of days. Places where I get almost immediate relief are doctors' and dentists' offices. Immediately upon entering I feel significant relief, and after couple minutes spent there it gets even better. I am quite sure it happens because those places are sterilized. Being out on fresh air also brings significant relief, but not as much as being in doctors' and dentists' offices. I used many different medications and visited many doctors. Medications that provided significant relief are antihistamines. I tried different types and all of them caused extreme drowsiness and limb weakness. One time it was so extreme that I almost dropped a pot while carrying it from the fridge to the table. Even bilastine, which was designed for treating allergy without drowsiness, caused severe drowsiness. Corticosteroids such as Avamys and Nasonex didn't provide any relief at all. Capsaicin (ingredient found in hot peppers) based sprays bring mild, very short-lasting relief (up to one hour). Besides medications, there are some other things that provide partial relief. Saline solution provides partial relief immediately. Condition worsens again in 20-30 minutes, depending on the place I'm at. Showers also provide instant parital relief, but it worsens after I spend about 20 minutes in my room. I did allergy tests. I used skin prick test to test for all common allergens and it turned out negative. Then I measured total IgE in blood, it was 193 kU/L, which is higher than the reference value (122 kU/L). Then I ran specific IgE tests from blood for some allergens, and all of them turned out to be negative. All of this means I am allergic, but can't determine exact cause of allergy. I had a deviated septum surgery before we determined I suffered from allergy, the surgery didn't help at all (during the surgery they also removed a little bit of my turbinates). Later I had RF mucotomy (basically burning your turbinates with high temperature) done, it didn't provide significant relief. More detailed, there are 2 problems with  turbinates. One is the burning sensation and the other one is the enlargement of turbinates. Burning sensation is bad, but it can be controlled with large quantities of saline solution. Also, the burning sensation almost always comes together with enlargened turbinates, but turbinates can be enlargened without the burning sensation. The enlargement of the turbinates is the biggest problem. At almost all times only one turbinate is enlargened, every couple of hours they switch sides (nasal cycle). In some places both turbinates swell badly (places with poor ventilation like caffe bars and some restaurants). The problem with enlargened turbinates is that I feel they are literally pressing my brain against the skull. If the left turbinate is enlargened then I feel pressure in the left side of the head, and if the right turbinate is enlargened then I feel pressure in the right side of the head. This pressure makes me go mad. I go to into ""Hulk-like mode"". I become very nervous and talk aggressively to people around me for no real reason except for enlargened turbinates. I believe that  enlargened turbinates are significantly reducing blood flow to the brain because of the following:  First, POTS (Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) - when I stand up after sitting or lying down for a longer period of time I feel like I will pass out, my vision goes black. I already passed out once. When I stand up I need to sit down immediately for 10 seconds until my head gets better, if I don't sit down I'd pass out for sure. What is important is that if my left turbinate is enlargened then I get a black out feeling in the left side of my head (same goes for right turbinate and right side of head). Second, when my turbinates are enlargened I feel extreme tiredness, regardless of the amount of sleep I get. I sometimes fall asleep during lectures while sitting in the first row of the classroom. I believe it is caused by enlargened turbinates because when I rinse my nose with saline solution I immediately become less tired or stop being tired at all. Washing my face with water also helps with tiredness. I believe that by rinsing my nose and washing my face I am removing the allergen from my body. Third, partially connected to the second, is yawning. When my turbinates are enlargened I yawn literally once every minute. Fourth, my focus becomes very poor. It is what gives me the most trouble. I literally can't pay attention for more than 5 seconds, and when I lose focus it takes at least as much to regain it. I often can't even have a decent conversation because it's too hard to think about what the other side is saying and what I will respond. I also become very slowed down. Everyday normal tasks, like taking a shower and preparing meals take a lot longer than they should. The hardest activity is learning. It takes ages to read something and even more time to memorize it. It becomes harder and harder each semester (I am studying computer science). Fifth, also very important, is that my voice is weird and more quiet when turbinates are enlargened, it feels like I am speaking through my nose. People don't take me seriously when I talk using that voice. If you suffer from the same condition or know someone who does please share your advice and your diagnosis. I repeat my kind request: please do not to post comments if you suffer from runny nose. 0 likes, 13 replies "

She's quite and always in pain, mostly from her mouth but also from rhuematism. I'm telling you this so you have a small character profile to judge her new behaviour on as missing my graduation is a massive shock because to her the sun shines out of my arse. So missing my graduation is a massive thing, even more than if she actually had missed her childrens' weddings. So now I feel there is definitely need to worry.    She recently had a bad few days where she wouldn't leave bed and believed she was dying. My aunty and uncle took her to the doctors and they prescribed her with some anxiety medications - I don't know which one. Then she was fine for a month, back to her normal self. Still very timid and disliked leaving the house but could still go do her shopping and was as happy as she could be. Last week, the doctors took her off her anxiety tablets and changed her blood pressure tablets to Ramipril - I don't know what blood pressure tablets she was on before. Since then she's been massively depressed. She can't leave the house and says she constantly feels terrible and once again thinks she's gonna die. She is currently going to the hospital for pains in her mouth and something to do with her spine but nobody knows anything yet, they're still testing. So I imagine that added with her depression can quite easily make someone feel as if they are going to die.  My mum has come round and told her of a story of three women somewhere in the world who all had the exact symptoms that my nana has and it took a special doctor somewhere to connect the dots and realise that it was the Ramipril so now my nana believes it's Ramipril that is making her feel so bad. She refuses to believe that she's ever been like this before, even though she was in bed believing she was going to die before Ramipril. I've done some googling and it does seem that there's enough evidence that Ramipril can cause or worsen depression but my mum is a pretty strong liar who told her to stop taking her rheumatic medication and to replace it with fake   so I'd just like information from someone more reliable on Ramipril and depression.  She also takes:  Simvastatin, Levothyroxine, Mirtazapine, Ibuprofen and Cardide SR. I guess my overall question is: can Rampril be the issue? She fully refuses to believe that she has ever been this depressed and therefore doesn't tell her doctor about her depression, even though she believed she was dying just over a month ago.  Cheers for any help. Sorry if I seem out of touch with depression, I was diagnosed with anxiety at an early age because both my parents are addicts so I can semi understand her feelings but I've never been diagnosed with depression so I cannot fully understand it.    0 likes, 1 reply "

I was diagnosed with mononucleosis back in the middle of July, and since then I've had all kinds of symptoms: Fatigue,  , brain fog, stomach cramps, less appetite, and nausea. The symptoms had mostly gone away until my period, but two days before my cycle began they all came back, especially the nausea after eating. Now normally, I have   anyways, but lately I've been somewhat constipated, my eyes and nose have been dried out, and the vision in my right eye seems worse (but I might just have not noticed it before since I wasn't so hyperaware of everything then). But my biggest concern is that after I eat, I feel really shaky. My whole body will have tremors for up to 30 minutes almost immediately after eating and it really worries me. I've been eating a lot less than usual because of my lessened appetite and nausea, and I was already underweight to begin with so I was thinking maybe vitamin deficiency, but it worries me so much and I'm out of town so I can't go back to the doctor right now for anymore bloodwork. Bloodwork done in July came back fine except for the mono, dehydration, and a slight vitamin D deficiency, but it's really worrying me. I was told trembling can happen with mono, but I posted in this category instead now since it usually happens mostly after I've eaten. 1 like, 0 replies "

I have   and I'm a wheelchair user. I've been struggling with pain in my feet for well over a year now and have all the other symptoms of Raynaud's. The furthest I've got to a diagnosis is actually a nod from my podiatrist when I asked him if it was Raynaud's! Guess it's a start! But I do have constantly cold hands, white fingers when they are particularly cold, either red or purple freezing cold feet( but they can also get extremely hot and go rw red?)  My nipples go purple! And I'm wondering if the ear pain experienced when trying to wear headphones could be connected? To cut a very long story short, I originally thought I had a pressure sore on the underside of my heel which was discounted by the district nurses. (I have a red mark on my right heel that has always been extremely painful), and it wasn't until my left heel started giving me exactly the same pain, but had no red marks, that I realised this pain could be part of the Raynaud's. It's a cross between burning and stabbing. Having done some research I understand that stress can bring on an attack. So I'm assuming that an attack is when the pain is at its worst? I am by no means asking for a medical opinion, just to hear from someone who has gone through this as well. If it's not something that is common with Raynaud's, I know I need to have further investigation. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my post and you really do have my sympathies!

Movement Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/cervical-dystonia-getting-better-665190,Cervical Dystonia getting better,"I've had slight tremors in my neck for years, and the past 2 to 3 years it got worse.  Especially when I'm nervous, but basically all the time, at least slightly.  It always looks like I'm shaking my head ""no"".  Went to 2 neurologists - 1 said Essential Tremor, the other said Cervical Dystonia since it is worse when my head is in certain positions.  It's become really bad when I'm driving for some reason (not sure if I'm stressed because the highways are filled with nuts, or if it's some kind of inner-ear related balance thing). The only option the neurologist gave was botox injections..  Since my condition is not horrible all the time (only SOME of the time), I decided to wait until I couldn't take it anymore to try Botox. In the meantime, I did research and reading about not just dystonia, but nervous system conditions.  I thought I'd let others know what I've tried because my condition has been getting markedly better - on my drive in to work this morning, I hardly shook at all.  I AM NOT a doctor nor suggesting people try this, but maybe research and look into the list below. 1. Prayer - I'm a Christian and turn to God in times of trouble and in times of celebration. I prayed that my condition would improve, if it was His will, and that I'd have the strength to deal with it if it wasn't.  I didn't improve overnight, but I knew that God had my back no matter what, and would point me in the right direction. 2. Magnesium L-Threonate - I read this is the best type of magnesium for ""brain use"" and that magnesium deficiency is prevalent and can lead to neurological issues 3. Vitamin D and K - to go with the magnesium 4. Vitamin B complex 5. Fish oil supplements 6.   supplements 7. Calming herbal supplements (Calm Thoughts by  . I've also used Tremenol which is on Amazon too). I figured if my tremors were worse when I was nervous, calming my nervous system could only be a benefit 8. Muscle rolling my neck and back - with a tennis ball against the wall.  Only for about 10 minutes, deep rolling my neck and shoulder/upper back muscles 9. Pilates/core work.  I did this originally for back pain which got a lot better, but maybe it's also contributing to my neck muscles calming down. That's my list - I hope it helps someone!   0 likes, 0 replies "

I'm sorry if this isn't the right thread to ask this. There are a ton of choices to post under! So about a week ago, the pinky finger on my left hand started twitching. I would say every 10 seconds or so. It lasted the whole day then went away. The next day, twitching started in both hands and both feet. Like a lot of other people, I turned to the web. Freaked out when I saw ALS, Parkinson's, MS, etc. I also read this could be due to stress/anxiety. But the thing is I don't feel any more stressed or anxious than normal. I went to my chiropractor as I had an appointment on the Thursday. She said that severe diseases usually have other symptoms too. Eg., Parkinson's usually comes with constipation. That freaked me out because, out of the blue, I was constipated for 3 days. Thinking I was pretty much going to die (am I a hypochondriac??) I booked a dr appointment with my primary care physician. He tested the strength in all ligaments. He tested the reflex in all joints. Got me to walk in a line toe to toe.  His conclusion was that it would work itself out. He said I am not displaying any Parkinson's symptoms (they are more like tremors) and sent me for blood work. I think we were looking for any mineral/vitamin imbalance. He told me to come back in 2 weeks if it's not gone or earlier if it's worse. Anyway, that was yesterday. I'm just not convinced. I'm terrified. Really terrified. It's causing a lot of stress and that's making my neck and shoulders sore (as normal) so it's hard to gauge if I'm weak I need advice. The twitching is minor. I'm just so tired from the anxiety this is causing that I can't tell if I'm actually experiencing other symptoms. What do you guys suggest? 0 likes, 3 replies "

The pins and needles and numbness would just happen to one side of my body. Most of the time, my legs feel like they have been weighted down with a ball and chain, making it difficult to walk. Most of the time, I struggle getting up from sitting in a chair. When I do any sort of writing, my hand would cramp up and spasm, making my hand writing very shaky looking. Recently, it is extra easy for me to feel too cold or too hot, making it extremely difficult to regulate my body temperature. After these symptoms had happened, my chronic fatigue started to get worse.  I do have very mild anixety, it never affects me unless I get specific triggers as I have PTSD. I do worry as much as the next person does, maybe a little bit more.  At first, it was believed that it was stress that caused it but now the professor I see is now very concerned that the dystonia is still happening. I have seen a therapist and my last appointment is tomorrow. However, none of the therapy has made an affect on my symptoms at all.  I have no stressful events happening in my life for the past year or so. I have no work to stress me out.

It's worth looking into this - my consultant decided to look at my vitamin d levels and the result was they were so very low. After treatment with vitamin d3 high dose for over a year, my tremors have gone! The thing is that without vitamin d3 at correct levels, you are not absorbing calcium and the body will shut down without those two working together!

Movement Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/tardive-dyskinesia-is-anyone-else-angry-and-want-to-do-something-about-it--658466,Tardive dyskinesia-Is anyone else angry and want to do something about it?,"So, my name is Katie. I suffer from severe acid reflux, which is why two and a half years ago I was given metaclopramide in the UK, where I was studying abroad. I was never told any of the horrific ""side effects"" that could be caused by it, and after being on it for only two days I developed what I know in my heart to be tardive dyskinesia (and/or some other form of brain damage that causes your muscles to move/spasm and your body to not work properly) though I was never given a diagnosis by a medical doctor because every time I went to a neurologist they denied that anything was wrong with me or tried to tell me what was happening was normal. For the past almost 3 years now, I have suffered immensely, and my condition is constantly evolving. It began anxiety and intense brain fog, to the point where I couldn't drive because I felt unsafe. I had excruciating, unexplained pain all over my body, painful muscle twitches/spasms, many which were not outwardly visible (some of which were) and the feeling or actual sensation that my body/head was shaking rapidly which made me nauseated and irritable. On top of this, normal body processes were disrupted, I got worse symptoms when I was sick and my immunity was compromised, I was punished by my body (in the form of overwhelming brain fog and worsened shaking/spasms) when I got aroused by my boyfriend, stayed up too late, thought too hard, listened to music at the wrong time, ate certain foods, or got acid reflux (which was all the time since that's what I was taking the medication for to begin with.) Many of these thing evolved systematically-meaning the symptoms changed slightly as they got better and it was a constant cycle of things getting better and then worse and then a little better than before, up until I reached the point I am at now. I am tired of the medical community treating this like a side affect, an allergic reaction, or just an unfortunate plague that has hit our community of people. I was poisoned. What happened to me was not inevitable; something that heals in such a systematic way and lasts for years to a lifetime is not an ""allergic reaction."" I have compared my symptoms and healing process to people who have suffered traumatic brain injuries/strokes and there are very many similarities. TD isn't a “condition”, it is a form of brain damage. They damaged our brains. Why are we letting them fool us? They maimed us and left us for dead, basically- left as freaks to a life of limitations and pain with no support (monetary, emotional, or treatment-wise) to help us through. We are unpaid medical experiments with almost no knowledge of what they did to us and what is going on in our brains (THEY don't even know, and they don't care much to try and find out. There is only a tiny amount of TD research going on right now, and you can bet its not the doctors or drug companies who did it doing the funding out of compassion for what they did.) I am angry, and my life is broken, and I am tired of being powerless against a system with a lack of responsibility, or care to stop this. And it's not like we were unknowingly given this they knew. And have known since at least the 80s, but probably before then too. The harm of this medication is too great to risk. No one would take it, knowing what it could do, if they had it for one day. The number one rule of medicine is DO NOT HARM. You do not knowingly give a sick patient something that can not only make them sicker, but disable and destroy them for the rest of their life. I want to tell my story and be heard and acknowledged, most importantly by the medical community who turns a deaf ear or treats me like I'm crazy for feeling this way, and becoming upset when I expose them for what they are doing. I AM A VICTIM. And I want to DO something. I want OTHER people to do something. I want people to research a way to FIX my brain, not mask it with more drugs that f**k up other parts of me to mask the symptoms (like that new EXPENSIVE drug that depletes your dopamine supply so that you don't get symptoms because your brain can't process them anymore because it was DAMAGED--funny, isn't dopamine what makes us happy?) Does anyone else feel the same? Is anyone else tired of being complacent with this crap? We're only powerless alone, but together, they will have to hear us.   0 likes, 24 replies "

Movement Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/tremors-and-body-wide-twitching--679516,Tremors and Body wide twitching.,"Hello everyone, Im a 18 year old male and have been experiencing a tremor in my head, face, hands and also body wide twitching. The twitching came first, it started around 1 and a half years ago, it was only a few small twitches here and there to start with but has now progressed into constant thumping twitches that happen every 30 seconds or so. I have also, over the past year, developed tremors, I had a small tremor in my hands when i held them out against gravity and when i was using my phone with one hand. There wasn't much progression in my hand tremors and It didnt really bother me , although it was still present. Around 6 months after that, I began to notice a head shake when i was talking to a stranger face to face. Since that day it has been noticeable when having a conversation with someone and now even happens when I'm at home relaxed. My hands have got quite a bit worse when holding them in certain positions and now even my face is starting to tremor. For example when i close my eyes, i feel my eyelids shaking and when i smile my cheeks shake. Considering I have always been a very anxious person both generally and socially, I put the symptoms down to that. However, only since I've had the head tremor, I have been pretty much housebound in fear of embarrassment, where as before it was only mild  . It is literally ruining my life and I'm scared that its only gonna get worse from here. I went to see a psychiatrist for anxiety while i was abroad, when the head shakes were still mild. She give me propranolol and Xanax. Neither of them had any affect and just made me feel tired. Ive also tried exercising more, which makes them worse afterwards. Ive tried changing my diet and cutting gluten. Ive tried   for a few weeks. Ive tried magnesium B12 and  . All to no avail. The only thing that does help is to have a few drinks, but i cant do that forever, haha. Ive read up alot on  , which im assuming it could be. Although it did progress quite quickly and its also rare to have a head tremor with that condition at this age. Im going to see a neurologist as soon as i can and im praying it can be corrected. Im too sensitive to this kind of thing.  Would appreciate any thoughts and feedback on what it might be or anything else to try before visiting a neurologist and all the rest.

I have constant fasciculations in my hands at rest and my fingers will slowly move independently. At the moment I am holding my tablet with four fingers and my thumb first violently shakes and then slowly moves away from the rest of my fingers - it is quite unnerving! If I sit with my hand stretched out on my thigh within about five minutes my fingers will have curved into a ball and the hand will have slowly sunk to my side. Sometimes a joint will lock, usually fingers. Sometimes I get a cramp like spasm all down either one leg or my toes on either foot will stick out rigidly - very painful - but momentary as I shake the affected bit out.  This usually happens when lying down having just woken  up. My handwriting is very erratic going from normal to small to large - I do have arthritis in my hands so writing has got worse anyway. Any body recognise these symptoms please?  When I mentioned to GP a few years ago he dismissed them as fasciculations.  I did actually see a neurologist privately he was not concerned but things are getting worse.  I do already take beta blockers and fluoxetine which might account for the fuzzy head feeling I am also experiencing but the trembling/involuntary movements started before the I started to take the latter!

There is sometimes heaviness in my calves too, but no real pain. I don't really notice this when I am walking or running, only when I am sitting down, especially at night time in bed. I occasionally have twitches in other parts of the body too but only very noticeable in both my calf/lower leg muscles. I don't think this has much to do with me running too much, because I don't anymore. 6 months ago while training for the marathon, I did notice the muscle twitches, but they went after a day or two... until now. Any suggestion would be appreciated. Is this a sign of MS? Thanks 0 likes, 2 replies "

Multiple Sclerosis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/abnormal-brain-mri-hoping-for-reassurance-682742,Abnormal Brain MRI - hoping for reassurance,"Hi, As the title suggests, I have recently had a brain scan which showed some abnormalities. I am having a repeat scan next month but no one from Neurology has directly spoken to me. I am getting conflicting information and am feeling really low. I was admitted to hospital a couple of months ago with severe abdominal pain. It turned out I had a bile stone lodged in my bile duct, even though I had my gallbladder out 3 years ago, I have all the luck lol. This developed into a severe infection and I was really poorly and bright yellow from jaundice. Whilst this was going on, I developed a crushing headache, pretty much across my forehead. Then I lost part of my vision, which terrified me. It was like parts of words were disappearing. I was seen at the Eye Hospital and they said my eyes were fine. Then I had a brain MRI with and without contrast. I pestered the doctors for my results but they were all Gastro specialists and said they weren't as familiar with the report. One doctor said it showed something pressing on my brain.  Ashamed to say that this sent me in to a massive panic. Assumed he meant a tumour and I got myself in to a state. No one has mentioned this to me, though. I was so upset and confused that I asked another doctor who said it showed inflammation pressing on the optic nerve. They said they were going to give me high doses of Prednisone  introveniously for three days. Shorty after this I then had my operation to remove the bile stone.  Following this the jaundice settled and my eyesight returned and has been fine since and no more headaches.  I have never really suffered with headaches in the past. Whilst in hospital a different doctor told me that the scan showed potential signs of demyelination and a lesion. He told me not to Google it but as soon as my sight returned, I did and of course it brought up MS as a possibility. Then my GP rang, when I was home and said nothing was definite and it just showed pale patches. Apologies for the long and rambling post but feel so down and alone. I am not normally a worrier but just frightened for the future and the effect on my children. Before my op I was really ill and the the operation itself did not go smoothly and turned in to major surgery and then I got an additional infection. After all my rambling on, I suppose main thing I am wondering about is,   could the lesion and demyelination have been caused by some thing else? Does anyone have experience of this? I also have psoriasis and have been recently referred to a rheumatologist as I have had some joint pain. in my back, ankle and hip. My second scan is a month away but feels like an eternity.  The sensible part of me says to accept the waiting game.  The other part is already coming to conclusions. Been thinking about posting this for a few days but been too scared to admit to myself how I am feeling.  Also feeling scared about potential responses, I am such a mess today. I have re-read this and I sound neurotic making such a fuss Thanks in advance, in case anyone can offer reassurance. Sending best wishes and positive thoughts to all. 0 likes, 3 replies "
Multiple Sclerosis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/could-this-be-ms--686090,could this be ms?,"hello everyone! i'm 17. i started having issues with incontinence quite a while ago. i don't have issues with making it on time, but with urine leaking all the time. i usually don't feel it leak, i only find out about it when i go to the bathroom. i did blood tests, urine tests, went to see a nephrologist and everything was normal. i was sent for urodynamics, but the doctor hasn't called me back for about 2 months and i'm starting to think i won't do that test any time soon. my symptoms besides the incontinence are feet being cold all the time and pulsating, my hands only being cold to the point it hurts. some time ago i experienced unexplained shoulder/armpit/arm pain that none of the doctors i went to couldn't find a cause of. it lasted for months but it miraculously stopped one day and i'm still wondering why it all happened. i also experience lower back pain especially after walking. a few weeks ago i started feeling severely tired that i'm starting to go to bed at 8-9 pm. i have trouble staying concentrated and feel detached and plugged off most of the time, but that might not have to do anything with this. i also experienced severe dizziness for 5 days straight when i couldn't walk without feeling drowsy, unstable and uncoordinated. it stopped, but i still feel dizziness occasionally when i lay in my bed or close my eyes or when i get up (i have low blood pressure). could this be ms in progress? i'm kinda scared because i've been doing tests for my urinary system while i think it might be something else. my doctor told me to do an xray of my back, but that's not happening any time soon as i was told to do it after the urodynamics test, but the doctor obviously isn't going to call me back for a while. has anyone felt this? the fact that i don't know what's wrong with me scares me more than the fact that it could be ms. i hope someone answers me because anything at this point could make me feel at ease at least a little bit. thank you 😃 0 likes, 0 replies "

I've had some symptoms the past few months that I'm not sure what they all mean.  Personally, I'm freaking out that it is ALS, but logically,I just turned 36, so this would be very young for that.  I have a neurology consult that needs to be scheduled, but thought I would reach out here in the meantime.  Below are my symptoms outlined up to most recently. Roughly 6 months ago: Nothing that I can specifically put words to, but just felt like my legs weren't working right.....no strength issues, but like it almost felt difficult to slip my feet into my shoes, like it was taking way more effort than it should.  Also, I felt like one of my feet wanted to turn in some, kind of crampy. 2.5 months ago: My hand/thumb twitched.  That area of the palm right under your thumb.  This continued for a few days. When you google this, you will think you have ALS.  At that time, I didn't connect the dots, but noticed that my eyes (both) were randomly twitching, though my left way worse and more frequently than the right.  In the weeks following, everything began to twich (or fasisculate).  Literally everything, everywhere.  My abdomen, my vagina, everything.  A couple of weeks ago, I significantly cut back on my caffeine usage and the muscle twitches improved drastically. Somewhere between the 6 months and 2.5 months, I started to feel the same way about my hands as I did my feet and legs.  It just felt like they did not work as nimbly as before.  For example, reaching into my purse to grab something, it's like my hands can't move or sift through things . Past 2 weeks: I feel like my arms don't work anymore.  I would not say weak, as I can still lift my children, carseats, etc.  They just don't move like I want them to.  An example of this, putting socks on my 4 year old is a struggle (more than just putting socks on a 4 year old normally is). Also, the other day I noticed like it felt like my whole right side went numb.  I could feel things, but it just felt like it was number than the other side.  From what I' ve googled and read, this might be due to spasms....like my arms are in some sort of spastic movement.  This sort of makes sense, as last week we were doing some cleaning and re-arranging around the house, and it seemed like any major, big body moves caused a spasm somewhere. Other info: I do have iron-deficiency anemia apparently (haven't met with the doc to see how bad, but must be somewhat significant as they called to say don't miss the appointment), major  , and I had a baby a year ago (possibly what triggered all of this).  I just don't think this is anxiety at this point. Thanks for reading until this point.....info/feedback appreciated! 0 likes, 2 replies "

Multiple Sclerosis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/really-starting-to-think-i-may-have-ms-687107,Really starting to think I may have MS,"Seems like there a lot of discussions started here about this, but few replies, so I guess I'm just writing to get it out there. I am a 44 year old female who has been experiencing a crazy array of symptoms for the past year or so, many of which have been chalked up to perimenopause (insomnia, heart  , increased anxiety, wonky cycles) after a blood test showed elevated FSH.  For the past month or so, however, I've been experiencing paresthesia, which is leading me to question MS.  It started with tingling in my right foot - not true pins and needles or numbness, just a mild tingling.  It wasn't constant, but would start around mid-morning and last a few hours or, at the worst, til evening, and this happened almost daily, very cyclical.  I never experienced it at night.  Around the same time, my left arm felt very tired and heavy one day.  Went to my PCP and she prescribed PT, which has definitely helped (PT diagnosed me with upper crossed syndrome due to how I work) but every now and then, my arm gets that odd feeling.  A week or so ago, the foot tingling completely stopped but now I'm feeling weird tingling sensations under the skin on my right leg, almost like my leg is cold.  And here's the clincher - the other day, it totally felt like my upper left leg/rear end was wet, like I'd sat in something.  Of course, I was completely dry.  Dr. Google of course brings that up as one of the 'weird' symptoms of MS.  I had mentioned the foot tingling to my PCP when it first started and at that point, she didn't see any other reason to suspect anything 'big and scary.'  I go back to see her in a few weeks for a blood pressure check (mine's been elevated due to my increased anxiety) and will certainly mention these new symptoms.  But in reality - this does sound like possible MS, doesn't it?  The thought of that scares me so badly, but in some respects, it would be nice to know what's going on with my body. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I suspect (never been told) that mine is secondary Raynaud's.  Had very poor circulation since I was small (I remember it at 8, 10, 14 years old), no matter what my exercise or how much (used to walk 14 to 20 miles a day - didn't help). But during a cold spell recently I had to shovel in 10-degree weather, and despite superbly warm gear and extra precautions, I had an attack from Hell.  Afterwards, I was not surprised (  the same as not being driven quite out of my mind) at the excrutiating pain of immediate recovery.  Been there done that. But after  , it started dawning on me that my fingertips felt like I'd burned all 10 of them on a hot pan or something similar.  And it has persisted.  It's going on 3 weeks, and they don't feel like they're getting better. It doesn't help that it's dry as the Sahara and they're all suffering no matter how I try to treat the dryness, plus I'm having to fingerprick them for   multiple times a day, thus building up a plentiful supply of callouses even though I try to spread the fingerpricks around. I feel like someone's been discreetly applying sandpaper to my fingertips every night in my sleep and then letting a scab develop before I wake up?  I don't know, that doesn't quite describe it.

Reactive Arthritis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/reactive-arthritis-positive-ending-619104,Reactive Arthritis - positive ending,"Hi everyone, I became ill nearly a year ago to the day and so I thought I would share my experience of Reactive Arthritis with you.  I don't share a lot on social media, and have never posted in a forum in my life, but to ""celebrate"" this odd anniversary here goes nothing... Before last November I was a very physically active 34-year-old woman with a stressful career and busy social life.  It took 6 weeks to get a conclusive diagnosis, during which time I was the most ill I had ever been in my life with what I now know to be classic Reactive Arthritis symptoms - pain in all my joints and tendons from the hips down making walking more than 10 steps very difficult, extreme fatigue, inflammatory temperatures, mind fogs, sensation of a UTI, bloodshot red raw but weeping eyes, extreme dry mouth, trouble breathing etc. etc.   During those weeks, and once I received a diagnosis, I was terrified.  Terrified I'd never get better.  Terrified I'd never walk normally again. Terrified I'd never be able to go back to work.  Terrified I'd never be able to swim, or run, or dance again.  Terrified I'd never be able to have children.  The list went on.   I spent quite a lot of time in bed on the internet looking for answers, my faith in my doctors having been severely shaken by my experiences in the weeks without diagnosis of constantly being sent away, at best being told to rest and come back if things failed to improve, or at worse being looked at almost as if my symptoms were psychosomatic. I wanted to know:  Why had this happened to me?  (Answer, doctors never did establish the infection that triggered my immune system's inappropriate response.)  What was my prognosis? And what could I do to make myself better, as nothing doctors were giving me (anti-inflammatories and steroids) were doing much good?      I wanted to tell you all that, a year on, I am better.   It been a long road.  You'll all know how Reactive Arthritis works so as you can imagine there's been lots of ups and downs.  I was discharged by the consultant after 6 months but I'd say it's only the past few months I've started to feel 100%. Everyone is different and so what worked for me may not be the same for you but I thought I would share what I found helpful.   I read online that some people had found acupuncture helpful.  I've never held too much truck with alternative therapies, and was scared of needles.  But I was so desperate to try anything to get back to ""normal"" I booked an appointment with a Traditional Chinese Medicine Acupuncturist.  When the first needle went into my foot I felt a pleasant rushing sensation down my leg. Where there had been pain and discomfort was suddenly energised and I was converted.  I went weekly for months and I believe, along with time, and other changes detailed below, it has helped me to recover.    Once the flare ups started to get further apart, and I had a bit more energy between flares, I bit the financial bullet and joined a gym with a sauna and steam room.  I found the heat of the sauna especially helpful, both with the dreadful cold aches in my bones I had almost continually and with loosening the tendons in my legs.   About 3 months in I went to see a hydrotherapist and got a set of exercises I could do in the gym pool myself, which I tried to do once a week for just 10 minutes.   When I felt like I had more energy, about 4 months in, I cautiously started aqua aerobics classes once a week.  I told the instructor about my condition and she was brilliant and stopped me from overdoing it.  (The temptation to push myself too hard in an attempt to feel like I was normal again was something I have battled with during my recovery.)  Even though I struggled, had to take a lot of rests during the class, and hobbled out of the pool at the end, the sensation of having done something physical, however minor compared to what I used to do, was such a psychological boost. As my energy levels increased, I started to go to aqua aerobics a couple of times a week.  And then I found a very gentle   class, and started going to that too.  Although I had to block out the fact that I was clearly much, much less physically able than other people in the class that were more than twice my age, stretching the tendons in my legs seemed to help with my mobility a lot.  The yoga classes also helped me to quiet down the terror I felt. I read a lot about diet, and, although I didn't follow the strict elimination diet recommended by some, I did find there were certain things that did increased my inflammation: mainly red meat, sugar (both natural and processed) and caffeine so I avoided them (although wasn't puritanical).  Now having given up caffeine, I'm not going back! But over the past year I would say my recovery has only been in part thanks to these physical activities.  My state of mind has been equally important.  In the first months, whenever I thought about, and so became distressed about the future, an inflammatory fever spike would happen that I could chart with a thermometer.  This made me realise that my mind and my body were not two entities but part of the same system.  Sounds obvious but this is not how the medical profession was treating me.  And so, that's why I would recommend yoga and acupuncture (I have since started gardening which is gentle enough and relaxing too).   I would like to say if you too are stressing about your future, there is hope.  Celebrate even the smallest advances you make - even if it's just getting out of bed to have a bath.  Coping with Reactive Arthritis is really hard and probably no one you know even knows what it is.   Please give yourself a break.  Don't beat yourself up.  Be kind to yourself. You can do it! 1 like, 14 replies "

PS: I had campylobacter-induced reactive arthritis in 2016 which lasted about two months. I got the same treatment but never really knew if I got better because of the medicine or just with time. My questions are: Does anyone have experience with Biologics? Are they dangerous? Any other alternatives that I should try? Has anyone had success with antibiotics?

I still as of yet do not have a diagnosis and i am a year on.

Now that I am 20 I'm experiencing some health issues doctors cannot seem to find the answer to.. a year ago (age 19) I weighed 193lbs 5' 7"" female now 20 I weigh 140 lbs and I didn't change anything about my diet OR excersize, before weighing 193lbs i never weighed over 160 I gained all of the weight after high school witch was understandable, change, no more sports(I was very active in high school), no excersizing at all literally. When I started to gain weight I started to get sick not feel very good never want to do anything and then one day I started to wake up feeling sick every morning, thought maybe pregnant but nope. I was not. I started to feel and get sick during the day keeping down anything was hard. The doctor, a GI specialist had me get a   done ( I was 19, 183lbs at this time) the only thing he found was inflammation in my stomach which led him to believe I may have celiacs disease, I started to drink a shake call thrive (gluten free) and I started to get sick less but I was still always so tired, a year later after letting my diet slip back and doing everything the same the doctor was shocked to see I weighed 140lbs I realized I had lost weight but not THAT MUCH and how?!

Reactive Arthritis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-rea-experience-676896,My ReA experience ,"Just thought I'd post about my experience thus far to help people, as it seems difficult to find information about ReA owing to it being fairly rare and often Peters out before getting a diagnosis.  On March 20th 2018 I rushed cooking some hunters chicken. 4 days later I had developed full blown (sorry for the pun)  , which was terribly painful for 4 days and ended in a course of  . The other 'effects' hung around for a further fortnight. On the last day of the infection my hands swelled up really painfully. The day after that I had   so  bad I couldn't even roll over in bed. The following day hands swollen again.   Over the next fortnight I was only eating 2 plain bagels a day due to my the battle damage in my gut and became lactose intolerant. Hands were also a bit tender from swelling.  And then the ReA started. Initially it was just palms, soles of feet and fingers that were swolen. I could push through with just ibuprofen. No biggie life goes on. Then the knees got in on the game within a month of the original infection. If I was sat for an hour or more I would struggle to walk for the first 100meters (Think shuffling feet, knees frozen bent, looking like quasimodo). My Dr didn't really know what to do or know anything about ReA. She just gave me omazerpole to stop ibuprofen giving stomach ulcers. About 3 months after the original infection it then got bad.... the toes got in on the game properly along with the soles of the feet. Think can't walk with a heel strike and can't roll forwards on the toes. My workmates started calling me the penguin because of how I shuffled about. Ibuprofen was was still enough to make it bearable so I kept missioning on expecting improvement in a few weeks.  But this stayed ebbing and flowing or months. Sometimes I'd have a go at gardening and it would be fine. Other days I'd push myself to fill and move a wheelbarrow and id collapse crying from frustration at not being able to do simple stuff. It does your nut in to be able to think straight and feel good be physically fit at just 37 but not be able to do anything physical. Then, woohoo, 3 pain free days. I was exstatic.  Could this be the start of the end after 5 month of pain and frustration? Nope.  At the end of August i got a rash over most of my body and my hands knees and feet swelled and hurt really bad.  Using my hands and walking more that 100m were off the cards entirety and i coukd feel the ReA heading for my back. By now ibuprofen was doing nothing to help. Cue a Saturday 'emergency' Drs appointment. Luckily the locum had seen ReA before and knew what to do. More omazerpole and this time some naproxen for swelling, 500mg 2x a day. Also  . Though the first naproxen dose made me fall asleep within 45 minutes of taking it, and I think caused a mild 2 hour long euphoric mania, it worked like magic on the ReA. A week on and I no longer have foot pain when I wake up, and though I can feel the ReA lurking in the background, I've just spent a week in a forest retreat walking 5 plus miles a day without any issues. The ReA is not gone, but it's definitely managed by the naproxen, and I can do almost everything again. I just take one dose of 500mg in an evening and it's enough to stave off the overnight inflammation. Currently awaiting the blood test results to see if there is a long term solution. The   also seems here to stay as a reminder of the gastroenteritis.

Reactive Arthritis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/reactive-arthritis-what-i-ve-tried-697315,Reactive Arthritis: What I’ve tried,"Hi all, I was diagnosed with   about 2 weeks after contracting Strep throat. I'm currently about 5 weeks in. The M.D. sent me home with advice to rest and take Ibuprofen, and that's it. I had already begun a course of   from a walk-in clinic Dr. I'd seen previously. Being a Naturopathic Dr. myself, I couldn't allow myself to wallow in misery and do nothing to help myself. I hauled out my old textbooks to see what course of action might be advised. I knew that certain foods increased inflammation and immune reactivity. I decided to start off with an old-school water fast to help calm down the inflammatory cytokine activity. I'm used to intermittent fasting for about 19 hours per day, which helps increase one's tolerance. It also helps to eat ketogenically for a couple of days beforehand to get your body accustomed to burning your fat instead of glucose. First attempt, I managed 52 hours. 12 hours after eating, the pain came roaring back. I next managed a 5 1/2 day fast with some electrolytes ( potassium, magnesium,  and sea salt) in water. My body hit a wall at that point, so I broke the fast for 2 days. the pain increased again, so I did one final fast. The idea is to fast until 1-2 days after resolution of symptoms. I made it another 5 1/2 days. That seems to be the maximum my body can tolerate, and I was feeling very weak. The electrolytes were no longer helping. Time to stop. My pain was considerably better and stayed so this time as I carefully reintroduced foods. I researched the Autoimmune Paleo diet (AIP) to come up with a plan. I wanted to avoid any foods which were known to increase inflammation. I also saw a traditional Chinese (TCM) doc, who checked me over and declared that my case was no longer very severe,  but that I needed to build up my strength ( Kidney Qi in TCM language). Not really a surprise,  considering all the fasting. I had lost about 20 lbs in 2 weeks. It really helped the inflammation,  but it comes at a cost. I began eating the following foods: homemade bone broth with some organic bouillon mixed in for flavor. Well-cooked broccoli, kale, cauliflower, asparagus, steamed sweet potatoes, cinnamon, turmeric,  coconut oil. Canned health food store wild salmon. Fresh juices from beets, ginger, lemon, grapefruit together, or cucumber lemon kale ginger sometimes. Aroy-D coconut milk in tetrapaks mixed with chia seeds and frozen wild blueberries. Symptoms really improved and stabilized. I also added some chicken liver paté to help rebuild Qi, and raw walnuts. I also got 3 home visits from an RMT who does myofascial work. Helped a lot. On the last visit he used a Dolphin Neurostim on my back and neck acupuncture points. Amazing! I now only take ibuprofen at bedtime. I can walk around my neighborhood and do errands. If I eat inflammatory foods, I feel it. I still feel more fatigue than usual. I try to take it easy. But I'm functional again. I feel pretty confident that I'll have this resolved in a couple of months rather than years. If you're out there and suffering, perhaps this will give you some ideas. 0 likes, 11 replies "

Molluscum Contagiosum,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/mollescum-journey-at-23-648608,Mollescum Journey at 23,"Hello! Just a lil background info before I go into detail. I'm a 23 year old white female with mollescum on my genital area. It took 4 months for my mollescum to even show up after I contracted it from my last sleeping partner unknowingly. 🙃  I started noticing my mollescum around early February. I'm guessing they started to appear a week or two before but I didn't notice until they matured. (Not an often shaver) I initially thought they were warts because I had been tested positive for hpv last year so I made an appt with the gyno. I was due for my yearly pap smear anyways so I went in to talk about my options. Turns out my bumps were in fact mollescum and not warts so she went ahead with my pap & it came back negative for hpv!! She went ahead and popped the mollescum I had and cauterized them with this match looking thing (?) and off I went. Although it was like the happiest day of my life because she told me I had beat my non-cancerous hpv, she also lead me to believe that mollescum was no big deal and what she did was gonna fix it! ?   WRONG. After the treatment 3 more popped up the next day. 🙄 (Not gonna lie, I took a few of her lil burn sticks cause I knew this was gonna happen) I treated myself exactly how she did and slowly they just went away! I had lil scars all over the place but I was so happy I felt like I beat it!  It was dormant for about 3 weeks and I even met a guy in that time. I honestly thought I was good to go, so I slept with him. Things were going great in our budding relationship until about a month later and he started noticing bumps too. I was devastated, first good thing going for me in awhile relationship wise and this happens. Fml. Sure enough mine were back. I was out of sticks, really didn't want to go back to the gyno and get scared up some more so I started online researching like crazy.  My first method was apple cidar soaked cotton with a bandaid over it. This was helping them dry up a little if I popped  them first but it was giving me a horrible rash. Within a day or two I had a rash all over my vagina and there were mollescum bumps everywhere. I started freaking out a little and ordered a bunch of all natural products so that they wouldn't irritate my superrr sensitive skin down there. I bought lemon balm,  , pure tea tree oil, pure tea tree oil SPRAY,   soap, (  creme was sold out) so I got the whole line of Dr. Weatgrass products. It was an expensive, but I'd definitely say it was worth it. I'm not trying to deal with this months on end.  Most of my products came very fast and I was left with a lot of options. Everyones skin is different, this is important because it may take a few tries to find out what method will work for you. Everyone has a different immune system, skin elasticity, melanin, absorbency so it may take longer for results in some people.  My third method has definitely been doing the trick. I've been showering daily with   soap only all over my body, I cut the bar into two pieces so I wouldn't have to use the same bar on my non-infected areas. I also wear gloves when I wash my infected areas. Do not shave. I towel dry my body (don't reuse) and very carefuly hold a paper towel over my vagina to dry. Do not rub or pat repeatedly just let it absorb for a second. Then use the hairdryer. (Same applies if you have it on other areas of your body) Do not towel dry your infected areas at all, use a hair dryer. It's become my bff except for Walgreens Tea tree oil spray. After I'm 100% dry I spray Dr. WG spray all over my genital area and even surrounding area a little. Dry with the hair dryer and repeat the process with the Tea tree oil SPRAY. It's gonna be a little tingly and uncomfortable but it's not that bad, just cover your genital openings. It also doesn't smell so great but this stuff works miracles so get over it lol. Make sure you sit and let it absorb and dry for awhile before you put your underwear back on or your underwear will absord most of it. I spray the area of my undies (cotton briefs only) that will touch the mollescum with a little TT oil spray and dry them too. Then went on with my day. I've been doing this process thoroughly 3 times a day, washing once a day, for a total of 4 days now and it's almost completely gone! My horrible rash I couldn't get rid of was gone in two days and my mollescum is down to just a few bumps! My small ones just shrunk away and a few fully matured within a couple days. I popped them and held a Tea tree oil soaked cotton ball over it until it stopped bleeding (5-10 mins) Then did my spray process as normal.  I haven't seen any new ones appear and my skin is finally healing. Going to be very adamant and add my Dr. WG creme when it comes in a couple days. It's a time consuming process but I can't believe how fast I've been seeing improvements, especially when it can take weeks for others. I really hope this helps someone and I'll post an update when I finally beat it 100%. Thank you for reading, good luck! 😊 0 likes, 1 reply "
Molluscum Contagiosum,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/molluscum-anxiety-please-help-648551,"Molluscum anxiety, please help ","Hi I had MC for about four or five months. I thought I was totally clear by about the beginning of February. I had it on my genitals, thighs, and towards the end my chest as well. I tried so many different things to get rid of them that it's hard to know what actually worked in the end,  however they really started to go when I used a combination of   soap and just popping the things using a needle and rubbing alcohol. I had the most, probably around 25 at any given time, in my genital area. They shrivelled up and went away. A couple of weeks ago, I noticed some pink blotches in my genital area along with some flat, clear spots on my chest.  Obviously I freaked the eff out. I ran to my GP, who looked at the spots on my chest and said they didn't look like molluscum, just ""random lesions"" and advised applying sudocrem. I did pop one and no core came out, just some clear fluid and a bit of blood. He called in  a sexual health nurse to look at my genitals, she looked using a big bright light and said it was just scarring. That I can believe... but I continue to worry about the ones on my chest. Any tiny spot on my body, for that matter. I don't think I can see the dimple in the ones on my chest and I compared a picture I took of the lesions in my genitals when I was first diagnosed and they don't look the same.. but I'm still worried sick.  I constantly Google images of molluscum to compare with the ones on my chest and some look the same, some don't.  I know it's not common for molluscum to come back... but still,  I'm worried sick. I study my genitals every day for signs and I often find little red bumps that make me panic, but by the next day they've gone down and a hair has sprouted out. Even back in November when I last got it seen to the doctor said the lesions I had seemed to be healing up. I guess I'm just looking for some advice and reassurance. I know it's not common for molluscum to come back and it's highly unlikely I've been reinfected, I haven't had sex since... and I know two different healthcare professionals have said don't worry... I do trust this GP... but it doesn't stop the  . I found a little red bump on my bikini line last night and I think I can see a hair inside, its not dimpled and when i pull it i can see s little white bump underneath.. my bikini line is nearly always red and irritated... but all this reassuring myself just isn't working. Doctors really do underestimate the psychological impact this condition has. I think it's just that I never got spots on my chest before,  none that I noticed anyway. I am stressed out and did just have a very heavy period a couple weeks back. I don't know if that might be part of it. Its got to the point where I'm constantly studying blemishes on others to compare them to my own.  A lot of people seem to have spots that look like mine, which gives me some hope. I'm constantly googling this for reassurance and all I come across is horror stories of people having this for years. I just want my life back. Any advice anyone can offer on whether this sounds like molluscum or if not how to manage the horrible anxiety it's left me with would be hugely appreciated.  Thank you. 0 likes, 4 replies "

Losing hope :( ","Hi guys, I just joined this group as I'm running out of hope with this horrible infection! I have probably had MC for about 5 months now, on my inner thigh and genital region. For the first 3 months, I actually thought I had ingrown hairs, or a fungal infection from having to wear stockings every day so I was lathering steroid cream on the bumps- which made it 10000x worse. I finally went to the doctor in early April, and I couldn't believe I had MC- still have no idea how I got it. We started burning the bumps, but alas they kept returning more and more. I have tried everything (ACV, TTO). I even got so desperate, I stupidly used 'wart-off' a highly acidic product. This actually burnt off most of my skin, including my very sensitive genital region. The pain was unbearable, I couldn't walk as huge burn blisters formed between my legs and my doc confirmed I had second degree burns. I did not think the MC could survive that trauma, but I was wrong and after my wounds heal guess what?.... MORE FRESH MC LESIONS!!  The doctor looked at the MC again after the burns had healed and he insisted it was clearing up. But I used my phone light to inspect myself again as I got home, and I could clearly see new lesions forming.  So this is where I'm at now. For the past week, I have been rigirous in my methods. I am using aldara 3 times a week, and on the other days using iodine solution( Aldara comes in teeny tiny packets and is super expensive, which is really annoying). I am then covering every inch of skin between my legs with tough, XL bandaids. It's not all that comfortable but that way I am stopping the infection from spreading ( I hope ). I do this every night after a shower. I then wear it for the whole next day then take the bandaids off in the shower at night and repeat the process. I have seen a big improvement with this method. My skin is quite red and irritated in general, but I know that the inflamation of molluscum is good as it means the immune system is fighting it. Other than scabby lesions, I have about 6 newer tiny ones that are only skin colour and I'm waiting for them to run its course.  I am going to Europe in July, which is only 6 weeks away. We are meant to be sailing around Croatia in a yacht and I have no idea how I am going to stomach wearing bikini with the scars I have from this horrible disease. It is so hard to keep positive, I have had to push away a relationship with someone I really liked because I was so afraid of him finding out/getting intimate.  I would love to hear other people's advice/stories. It's good to finally get this off my chest. I wish anyone else who is suffering with this a speedy recovery     Many thanks B  0 likes, 13 replies "

So today I went to a sexual health clinic for a check up and some general reassurance. I had been to my GP previously twice for a check who the second time advised me to go to an actual clinic to put my mind at rest. ?I'm still feeling pretty anxious, but definitely a lot better. I had an examination and they confirmed that the virus has gone. This is great in itself, but alongside this I got some general advice about MC that I thought would be helpful to share with you guys. There is so much conflicting and scary info on the internet that is no match for advice from experienced sexual health practitioners who see MC several times a day. So in a nutshell here's what it was: ?- Don't google MC. A lot of information is incorrect as well as stigmatising. MC is not officially regarded as an STI (in my country anyway), it is a skin condition and much like kids pass it around through playing and wrestlers pass it through, well, wrestling, adults pass it sexually because that's the close contact we have! ?- MC, like chickenpox, is something most people get at some point - usually as children, where it was probably either never noticed or a long forgotten distant memory. Those of us who are unfortunate to have never been exposed as children will end up getting as adults. It doesn't mean we are dirty, or promiscuous, or anything like that - it just means we are unlucky. ?- MC is incredibly common. I know we feel all alone when we get this because, like, who has even heard of this?! But it's more common than we think. He told me they literally see it several times a day. It's everywhere. ?- Unfortunately, without treatment, molluscum does tend to have an average duration of about 18 months (another doctor I've seen said 9 months so it seems the jury really is out on this), but very rarely longer than that, and it is very possible for it to not last this long at all. It tends to be that you will have an initial big outbreak, then they will come and go until about the one year mark, where there will be another big outbreak, then after that they should start going away. Your body will build an immunity to the virus then fight it, and it will go away with no scarring. Something that really scared me was reading online about people having this for years on end, and I raised this; I was told that this is not only exceedingly rare, but probably not molluscum at all if it lasts this long. I had the virus for only about five months but I did treat the living daylights out of it, and given the relatively short duration, I asked if it was possible that I actually had it for a lot longer and just didn't realise it. Confirmed that this was indeed possible. ?- Best treatments are removal and cryotherapy but they will leave scars (I can testify to this) ?- It won't come back once gone unless you are reinfected. ?I really hope this helps. MC WILL GO AWAY. Stay strong, and it will be gone before you know it. 0 likes, 7 replies "

I was on 15MG for three years, I cut down to 7.5MG when I went back onto Mirtazapine and this is my fourth year on it. Anyone who says 7.5mg isn't doing anything, you're very mistaken because this dosage helps me sleep and has caused me to put on a lot of weight, too. Now I want off it -- but my question is, how do I exactly come off this medication without experiencing what I did before? I need like a guide on how much I should cut down each week or something, and I cannot speak to my GP about this because as far as I'm concerned my GP isn't well informed about this medication because my GP's advice was to stop taking it after 3 days which I did and then I had that hell experience and he actually wanted me to not go back on it. So I am doing this solo, I just need a helping hand.   1 like, 39 replies "

Migraine,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/migraine-aura-unable-to-cope-688384,Migraine aura unable to cope,"I am looking for ways to cope with having   with aura. Prior to two months ago, I never heard of a migraine with aura. I have suffered from menstrual migraine for roughly 7/8 years, but they have only consisted of intense one sided pain that would last 24 hours. I was at work on October 17th, when suddenly everything seemed too bright. Then, I developed what I have since learned is a scotoma. It slowly got larger until it turned into colorful triangles that covered my entire view. The whole episode lasted roughly 30 minutes. I was brought by ambulance to the hospital and after many tests was told it was an ocular migraine. Three days later, I woke up to a zig zag pattern which turned into a bright arch that made its way across my vision in about 20 minutes. Then, two days after the second, I had another zig zag only aura while in doctor's office waiting room. To be totally honest, I feel like I have PTSD. I am completely traumatized by the whole experience. I know it may seem silly to some of you, but I truly had no idea what was happening to me. I thought I was fainting due to a heavy perimenopausal period. I'm not sure how to get over this fear. I send every day worrying that it will happen again. I haven't been to work since the initial incident and am on the cusp of losing my professional career. I am practically housebound and am afraid to be alone. This experience has completely changed my life. I should also mention that my vision has been blurry/wonky ever since the aura. I am not sure if it is migraine related or due to perimenopause. All I know is that I am afraid and no one I know in real life has ever experienced an aura. I feel very alone. 1 like, 30 replies "

Doctors didn’t take me serious and said it was a virus, then it was my age, then anxiety and throughout my teenage years just palmed me off with beta blocker tablets without knowing what was wrong with me. I finally got diagnosed with migraine associated vertigo when I was 19. I am now 22 and still nothing has been done about it. I am on 100mg topiramate per day and stemetil. I have a “dizzy attack” around once per week but when it happens I am bed bound for about 3 days. On bad weeks it can last a whole week. When this happens, I feel so dizzy I physically cannot lift my head up so if it happens when I’m outside I have to sit on the ground with my head down and I’m unable to see whose around me. I vomit until my stomach aches, I have slurred speech and unable to say more than 2/3 words and I’m unable to walk by myself and basically need someone to carry me into my bed. It’s the worst experience I’ve ever had in my life - and because I’ve had this since I was 3 years old it’s affected my life in every way possible. I don’t even know what to do anymore, I’ve been to the doctors more times than I can imagine but all they do is change my medication and I’ve been on so so many but nothing seems to make much of a difference.

This post could've gone in a few other forums but its a mainly neurological issue which sorta fits the symptoms of a   plus other stuff. The least odd symptom is near constant brain-fog and very mild headache. Beyond that, there have been two occurences where things escalated beyond that, they share some symptoms but not all. The first started with lightheadedness and strong brain fog, then progressed as I got the sense that my bloodpressure was suddenly dropping-- I could feel my hands going numb and the weight of my body pushing the blood out of the bottom of my feet, dizziness. With this, there was an increasing feeling of upset stomach typical of diarrhea. My face started to feel flushed and warm, my ears started ringing, I got tunnel vision and it became hard to stand. Oddly, every time I passed gas, the symptoms little by little subsided, and completely left once I used the bathroom. The second incident started with a blot of kaleidoscope-vision which was increasing in size. Besides this, I felt normal. As it increased in size, I gradually lost the ability to form sentences or remember what was just said to me, I could reason and grasp the meaning of what I wanted to say, but I couldn't find the words to express them. Like my entire vocabulary was 'on the tip of my tongue'. There was also a marked drop in blood pressure, I got lightheaded and my ears started ringing, and it hurt when I shook my head. None of this had happened before. Similarly, it seemed to subside with the passing of gas and stool, but I'm not totally sure. That night I was constantly bothered by my limbs going numb, even when completely horizontal and not compressed at all. The same problem has stayed persistent, but much less intense. I honestly have no idea what's goin on. Thanks for the help! 0 likes, 10 replies "

My headache is continuous there in the morning and there in the night. Early on it was band like but now it is mainly at the back but it moves around a bit.  I feel like there is a lead weight tied around my head. My headache is worse when I focus or read or around loud noises. I also feel like my headache gets worse everyday.   I also have a few other symptoms: - I struggle to get to sleep, I got to bed at 9:30 but don’t fall asleep to around 11:30 and my headache wakes me up at night up to 5 times a night, most commonly at 1 am, 3am and about 7am. -I’ve also felt sick on and off much of the time but otherwise I eat a varied diet. - I also have back ache although that started when I saw the chiropractor. -Lastly I go from hot to cold and can be sweating and then need to clutch a hot water bottle. -I am tired all of the time and constantly have to rest   I usually get a lot of headaches that are at the front of my head which go either over night or after taking Paracetamol. There is also a history of migraines in my family; my mum gets them so she is on a daily beta-blocker, my great grandmother also suffered with them.   I have tried quite a few medicines: Paracetamol, Calpol, Ibuprofen and Co-Codamol- a form of Codeine- which gave me really bad tummy ache. We suggested relaxants to the GP but she said it wouldn’t help so not to bother. I tried yoga which made me feel a little better but for only around 10 minutes. We also took me to the chiropractor but now I have really bad back ache, so we stopped that. Also, I found swimming good while in the pool but my headache got worse when I came out.   As of today, I have been to the GP 6 times. They first few said it was a virus. But the 3rd and 4th times I got a referral to CDU. I’ve been there three times where I have had neurological tests, an MRI, to sets of blood tests and I also went to eye casualty where they took photos of the back of my eye. All of those where clear; I’ve also been to the opticians and I don’t need glasses. We’ve also rung 111 twice, been to 3 pharmacists and been to A&E twice. None of which was much help and I can’t help feeling like they’ve missed something simple.   I have been of school for 8 weeks now but I tried going back in twice but it became to much to bear and I really want to be there doing in the work. I am also a perfectionist. So I wander if the answer is for them to send some worksheets home so I can do it in my leisure?   Recently I have felt really low because of the pain and not seeing my friends and when I do people say I should because I’m ill so then I feel guilty and don’t but then I feel lonely. Some days I can feel very bad like I don’t want to live and lock myself in the bathroom because I want to get away. On those bad days like I mention above there is a voice in my head telling me I want to die. But who wouldn’t feel low if they had been in pain constantly for 9 weeks?   I am going to the paediatrics Friday. Does anyone have any advice or has anyone been through this too?

Sorry for the long story! I'm not sure if the migraine is the source of my problems or a symptom . I only did one so far , but that's clearly when it all started. I'm a 37 yo male btw, no serious health issue until this... 1 month ago I had a strong migraine with aura, without headache, my very first one in my whole life. Very bright zig zag light shining in the middle of my field of view, lasted 30 min before disappearing trough the sides. After the episode, my brain felt very tired, but I didn’t make too much of it and thought I just needed rest and went to bed. The next day, i felt big discomfort to sound and light and i felt as if my vision had changed, (i have a small tendency to be cross eyed when i'm tired), and it has worsened ever since, especially because my eyes get tired so much quicker. Worst of all that day i started to have difficulty thinking, finding my words, having slurred speech, this intense fatigue when i was trying to think. For 10 days, i thought it was a regular migraine postdrome, so i rested a lot , and ate healthier, stopped going out, stopped smoking, i thought it was a good opportunity to get healthier, like a good wake up call. But it never went away, after 10 days i had a mental breakdown all of a sudden , because i had to face the fact of having to live like this or even worse slowly declining and disappearing into dementia. The   made everything worse of course... It took me a few weeks to take control of the fear, so now i'm coping with the condition. About distinctive symptoms : Everything that requires brain processing is a challenge, even just adding numbers sometimes. Regular conversation is so exhausting, I feel like I’m speaking a foreign language in my mother tongue. I feel like i can only treat direct simple questions , and all ""peripheral thinking"" is blocked, i used to have ideas all the time floating and now it's just a black hole, as if i had a bucket over my head. I also often feel disoriented, I have to actually “think” where I am or where I wanna go rather than “knowing it”, i go to places i know but i don't recognize them, or not straight away. I have this constant feeling of a barrier between my brain and the world perception, as if it was floating in cotton and not directly linked to the world...a bit like a hangover sensation. Only consolation, some days are better than others, and when this fog lifts a little, it's always in the evening. For the whole  month i had 2 evenings with very good clarity, it felt so good that i cried when it happened, but it's equally horrible and disheartening to see it all disappear the following morning... It's so powerful that i had to adapt my work around it, because some morning, i can't process more than yes/ no,left/ right, i'm super clumsy, do erratic stuff. My life now consists of waiting for the next day to come and offer some relief ,although i'm not in constant fear, i'm deeply depressed by this condition.... Now I try to remain active and positive, but it’s hard. Thank you for reading me and courage to all of you guys! Mike 1 like, 7 replies "

It did help to reduce the severity and frequency of migraines, but since the second treatment I have suffered a lot of unexplained generalised symptoms including numbess, weakness, pins and needles and pain in my legs, arms, hands and feet, difficulty walking (especially up hills or stairs) twitching of muscles all over body, general fatigue, diificulty in speaking, memory loss and reduced ability to concentrate. I have had numerous tests with neurologist, including MRI scans to rule out  . Most tests have been normal apart from very mild abnormality in EMG indicating some   in my feet. The symptoms are very slowly resolving with time, but are still present to some degree one year after the last botox treament. My neurologist submitted an adverse event report about the botox, but says that there have been no confirmed reports of distant effects of botulin toxin after treatment for migraine.

Long story short - I've suffered from headaches and tension type headaches for many years but its getting really really bad now. I have been to 2 neurologists about this in the last 2 years, had a brain scan,   - nothing! They say take medication and that's all. Headaches sometimes triggered by computer use but also develops on random occasions. Symptoms - Very deep headaches right behind both eyes,   in middle of head to front - sore, inflamed nerves right on top of scalp (hurts if you touch this area), inflamed occipital nerves at back of head. Ache/Stiff feeling extending down neck to base of neck. Sometimes causes me to feel ill to my chest and stomach but sometimes not. Feels achy/sore at base of neck but also sometimes only mildly in neck area. Cannot think or even function - makes me want to sleep. Had moderate results with physio but then my body almost ""Resets"" itself after a few weeks back to normal. Moving my jaw makes like a crackling feeling behind my eyes. It's really unusual but so bad. Cannot figure it out. Seems like its referred pain/headache from problems in my neck/spine but unsure. I have not been able to go out for 9 days now its been so bad.

Migraine,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/vestibular-migraine-and-continual-computer-use-696284,Vestibular Migraine and continual computer use,"Hey everyone! I was diagnosed what was thought to be Menieres Disease about 2 1/2 years ago. Overall, I’m a healthy 31 year old female. A few years ago, when the symptoms first started, I was working as a nurse in a hospital on a busy floor. I initially presented with constant vertigo, tinnitus and pressure to the left year. The symptoms were almost constant for months. I tried Meclizine, Valium, Promethazine, Dyazide and Betahistine, all of which were unsuccessful. Eventually my specialist, moved on to Dexamethasone injections into my ear. I received three rounds with no relief. My doctor was about to send me for another opinion, however, gradually my symptoms began to improve to where I was symptom free for about a year. I unfortunately had lost my previous job at the hospital because I was unable to work for months but eventually I started working again as a nurse but this time doing telephone triage all day. I basically look at a computer screen for 10 hour shifts talking to patients all day. I take multiple breaks through out the day, however, a few months into the new job, my symptoms returned. They weren’t bad a first but have gotten progressively worse over the past 8-9 months. I’m currently in the worse flare I've been to date. The symptoms consist of horrible vertigo, tinnitus, pressure and intense pain to my left ear but now with boughts of intense migraine pains. The symptoms have been on going for three weeks straight with no relief at all. I have been out of work the entire time (three weeks) and have no sick time left. I’m not eligible for FMLA. Unfortunately, there is just no way I can try and work and focus on a computer the way I feel. I saw a specialist today who does not believe I have Ménière’s disease as my hearing and balance tests were all normal. He believes I have vestibular migraines. He referred me to a neurologist (which looks like may take months to get into to see). I’m unaware when I’ll be able to return to work as the symptoms have not let up. I did start on Nortriptyline to see if it will help. My question is do you think that my migraines are further exacerbated from the continual computer use from my job? The symptoms did start up again soon after I started there. I have adjusted the brightness on the computer screen with no improvement. Try to take multiple breaks looking away from the computer. I find I get dizzy (even before this latest flare) if staring at a computer screen for too long. I wonder if I’d be better at a job with less computer time. Please let me know your thoughts or if you have experienced anything similar. Thank you! 0 likes, 4 replies "

I have been suffering severe chronic migraines for the past year and a bit and severe chronic headaches with occasional migraine for the past two and a half years. I’m 25 and I live in Australia. I haven’t had a headache free day since October 2015. I’ve seen four neurologists over the years and I found one in May last year that seems interested, even though there’s currently no cure, she is trying to help the best she can. It seems we have come to the end of the line with current treatments until new treatments start coming out. Botox injections failed and many other medications either didn’t work or had terrible side effects. Massage, acupuncture, etc hasn’t worked either.  My problem now is with my night time preventative, Endep. I’m up to a 50mg dose now. While it seems to be making a bit of difference with the severity of my migraines, I’ve started getting, on most nights, very weird dreams.  If anyone else gets this, is there anything that can be done about it? I would really like these weird dreams to stop. It scares me to try to come off it and on to another one, because if a migraine were to hit while I wasn’t at home, I would probably need to call an ambulance. Has anyone been able to come off it and on to another preventative? I have spoken to my GP about this and will mention to my neurologist when I go back in June.  Thanks 😊 0 likes, 10 replies "

Also taking 40mg Seroxat. What's the best way to come off Mirtazapine? The side effects outweigh the benefits. The medical profession have just left me in limbo. They were quick to put me on to the Mirtazapine but have offered no help in coming off. The waiting list to see a physchiatrist is months. The duty doctor just told me to go from 30mg to 15mg & then come straight off them. My own doctor said that there's not much she can do other than help me with the insomnia by prescribing me a week's supply of 7.5mg Zopiclone but no more after because they're addictive. So i feel that i am well & truly in complete limbo at the moment. Due to the insomnia, they advised me to go back on 30mg but the side effects were too harsh. They then advised me to drop to 22.5mg but still the insomnia continues & side effects are harsh. I've been sleeping 4 hours per night roughly for the last 2 weeks, which is having a detrimental impact on my mental & physical health. I feel the sooner i can safely get off the awful drug the better. The longer i take it the worse the withdrawals will be.

I have been taking 15 mg for about 8 months then tapered to 7.5 for a month and 3.75 for another month. I stopped taking it completely 3 weeks ago. Mirtazapine has helped me with sleep and anxiety to some extent but the weight gain (17 pounds) is more than I was willing to put up with.  I had no withdrawal symptoms during tapering or for the first 10 days after stopping. Since then my sleep has been getting gradually worse and right now can barely sleep at all without sleeping pill. I'm also feeling very tearful and having lots of negative thoughts. My appetite has reduced slightly although haven't lost any weight yet (unfortunately)  So questions for anyone has been through it... When did your withdrawal symptoms 'peak' and then start to get better? How quickly did your ability to sleep come back? And how long did it take you to lose weight gained?  I appreciate that everyone has a different experience, but it would be helpful just to have some idea of what's to come! Starting to feel a bit desperate especially with the insomnia.

I don't look over weight but the belly fat is just too annoying and does not help when breathing while sitting down. So I thought enough is enough and no diets had worked due to powerful cravings for cake, sweets and junk. I felt good and ready to stop the Mirtazapine  ie I felt ready! I looked into it and read other peoples experiences and I got to be honest it scared the life out of me from what I was reading with regards to Mirtazapine withdrawal. My advice DON'T! As it will only put the unnecessary fear into you Yes of course everyone is different, but go by how you feel and not by how others feel as you know your own body feelings! I went for the tapering off method but the method was mine that I think has worked for me well fingers crossed. This is what I done if you can call it tapering: January 30th 2019 I dropped the dose from 45mg to 30mg. This gave me stomach upset diarrhea that lasted 24 hours then all was good, Could not sleep and also vivid dreams but also more energy lasted only about 3 days the sleep problems that is. February 23rd 2019 I dropped the dose from 30mg down to 22.5mg per day. My sleep was normal but I did notice a bit of anxiety and internal tremors but I knew what the cause was so I just enjoyed the ride so to speak and within a few days the tremors stopped but still had some anxiety and to be honest I have anxiety anyway which Ive just got used to over the years.

Mirtazapine,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/remeron-withdrawal-hell--34786,Remeron withdrawal hell!!!,"I was put on Remeron (mirtazapine) by an Egyptian doctor when I worked in Saudi Arabia a year and a half ago and suffered from GERD. He told me that it would remove the nausea and help me sleep. That it did. What I didn't realize though was how difficult it would be to quit it. I'm at my wits end so please anyone who successfully went off let me know and share your experience, I really need it.  I had a surgery for GERD, but retained some hypersensitivity and pain problems despite that. I was seen by some of the most brilliant surgeons in the US and they did all tests and concluded that my surgery was a success and I'm suffering from a functional problem now.  I already tried to discontinue Remeron 4 or 5 times. I even tried to taper it over a month or two, but when I go off of it completely within 7-8 days I get the same picture: terrible abdominal pains, heartburn, cramps, some diarrhea, hunger pains, excruciating upper back aches that strangely come and go suddenly, exhausting nausea, no sleep for days, tremors, sweating profusely many times a day, general fatigue,   like condition, shakiness,  ,headaches and goosebumps, electric waves over my back and head, feeling of doom, complete desperation.  I have never felt all of these symptoms at once before. In fact I have never felt some of them at all ever before. Back in April the psychiatrist told me to take it every other day for 2 weeks and then just quit it. I tried that, and after 3 weeks of terrible suffering I gave in and went back on it again. I called and talked to the RNs and they just didn't seem to believe that it could be withdrawal.  As soon as I take 7.5 mg for a day or two, all the symptoms are gone, almost completely! It's amazing.  It's the only medication I've been taking since I quit all acid meds in April, 2011.  My GI Doctor told me to stop Remeron and start taking Nortriptyline for dyspepsia. I wish I could!!!! I tried again and it's been 3 weeks now and I'm absolutely dying. Nortriptyline is helping a little to take the edge off the pain and nausea and insomnia, but the suffering is still too much. It's mostly physical, mostly abdominal symptoms although I get a fair share of the other symptoms listed as well.  I even have a feeling that I don't have any underlying gastric pathology and this all is related to withdrawals. Otherwise how could it clear with the first dose or two of Remeron? A while ago when I was tapering  I felt very well on 7.5 mg every 3 days but when I stopped completely - after a week all the symptoms came back with a vengeance.

I'm 33 and never taken   before now, and my doctor recommended Mirtazapine as he said they’d help with my early waking too. I was falling asleep fine but waking up after only a few hours and unable to get back to sleep, meaning I was constantly shattered which exacerbated the anxiety and low mood. Anyway, as soon as I started taking the 30mg, they knocked me out I started to actually sleep through the night which was amazing. I started to feel slightly better straight away, whether that was the sleep or the drugs starting to take effect, I don’t know. After 3 weeks, the sedative effect seems to have completely stopped. For the last week, I’ve been struggling to fall and stay asleep, which is once again exacerbating the depression and anxiety. Is this normal? I’ve read that Mirtazapine’s sedative effect is better in lower doses, does this mean my sleep won’t get much better on 30mg? In those first 3 weeks when it was knocking me out at night, I realised just how important sleep is for the mood and general wellbeing. I had a great 3 weeks on Mirtazapine but now feeling like I’m back where I started – shattered, anxious and low. I’m hoping it’s just a blip and it’s my body adjusting to the drug.

First off let me say stop with all these horror stories giving people false hope! I was one of them! I have withdrawal from 7 medications since August of last year, Zyprexa, Depakote, propranolol, Seroquel, Valium, Remeron, and Lamictal. I did all these myself and help of my faith, but back to remeron. I was on 15mg of Remeron for 11 years. Now it was much easier than I expected, but did have trouble with nausea,  , insomnia, and  . Now I cut the 15 to 7.5 for 2 weeks, for 5 days I had heightened anxiety, and for 2 weeks insomnia, and nausea. Now the nausea, and insomnia were easy. Zofran once a day, and Phenergan to sleep with melatonin. I’m also prescribed Klonopin so anxiety wasn’t much a problem. The best thing to do to beat insomnia, because it has been 2 months and I still kinda have it but take Benadryl at bedtime with gabapentin and melatonin. But don’t replace Remeron with another sleeping pill. Get off it with melatonin and Benadryl, and exercise. I’m only on 300mg of gabapentin, and that’s my next drug to taper off of, and I have found a way to get off that with no withdrawals. But that’s for another post. So do not listen to these stupid horror stories, I have gad, and I came off it smoothly, but you will need medication for nausea, and nothing better than Phenergan for night and Zofran for the day. I promise you, it was simple and I was on it for 11 years,2 weeks on 7.5 then jumped off. Do this on easy weeks. It’s not bad  0 likes, 34 replies "

Molluscum Contagiosum,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/adult-mc-success-story-660065,Adult MC Success Story,"This site was pretty helpful so I wanted to relay my experience and lessons learned. I am not a medical professional but do have an advanced degree in engineering and the sciences.  My lessons learned are below. Having MC sucked, full stop. I did not know what it was. I did not know how to treat it effectively. It took a while to find competent medical help. And I was repeatedly told that it could last several years. I will not belabor this point except that it was helpful to read many of the other folks on this site discuss the challenges that they faced and I can completely relate to the emotional challenges you face. As I read through the medical literature, MC was constantly described as a nuisance virus and it was obvious that little effort had been expended to try to find a cure, effective remedies, or even understand the disease at all. This was also a source of frustration because the disease strongly impacted my life.  Over time, I assumed ownership and responsibility over my own battle with MC and recommend that you do the same. I was initially misdiagnosed and learned that a number of primary care doctors have never heard of MC. I saw 5 different dermatologists and would only rate 2 as reasonably competent. One dermatologist told me that I would be cured 24 hours after my first cryo-treatment. I saw two different urologists for unrelated issues but discussed MC. One was incredibly helpful and the other was not. Treatment options fall into 3 categories (1) Local destruction of MC - when a bump appears, you destroy it by freezing or acid or curettage or laser or some other means.  (2) Local excitation of Immune System - when a bump appears, you apply a substance that irritates the immune system in that area and gets the body to attack the virus. (3) Turbo charge your Immune System - more on this below. My recommendation is to do (1) or (2) AND (3). Everyone recommends that, as soon as a bump appears, you want to do (1) or (2) to eliminate it as quickly as possible. I personally tried a lot of different ways to physically eliminate the bumps and found freezing with liquid nitrogen to be the best (and least destructive). I even looked into getting my own liquid nitrogen from a supply store but it is very expensive. The wart freezing stuff seems to be reasonably effective as well and MUCH cheaper and you can do it yourself. I never tried curettage.  The turbo charge your overall immune system is what I haven't seen discussed much so I wanted to document my experiences.  I believe this is possibly the single most effective way to shorten your time with MC. The reason I believe this is that some folks get MC and it is horrible and lasts for years and others either never get it or have a few bumps and it goes away. The only explanation that I have for this is variation in immune systems. My infection started with one bump and then ballooned to dozens all over my body. My doctors said I was in for the long hall -- 12 to 18 months -- and one doctor gasped and said it was the worst adult case he had seen in years. However, I started doing the things below 3 months into my experience with relentless intensity and my entire MC experience lasted about 6 months. First, . I was drinking 60-100 extra ounces of water a day. Many people say that drinking water helps to clear up your skin so this makes a lot of sense intuitively. This ""treatment"" option is both easy and inexpensive and has tons of additional benefits. I cannot recommend this option enough.  Second, do all of the things you would do to be extremely healthy. Cut out all alcohol, eat lots of vegetables, eat less sugar, eat as healthily as you can, get lots of sleep, etc. Again, this treatment option is relatively inexpensive and has a ton of benefits. Third, I seemed to have good success with Cimetidine/Tagamet at high dosage (1000 - 2000mg per day). This drug has been shown to have effectiveness against all sorts of viruses including MC (and HPV and herpes and others). Unfortunately, it is off patent and no one is running the trials necessary to flesh out its true capabilities. Note that Walmart sells this OTC for a VERY low price. Also, note that I ramped up my dosage slowly over time to see if there were any side effects. One of the most difficult parts of MC was being able to identify what was MC and what was something else, like folliculitis. I highly recommend training yourself using photos from the Internet as MC have a pretty distinct appearance (as compared to many other things that cause red bumps).  I wish you the best of luck. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Molluscum Contagiosum,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/mc-eczema-hell-656411,MC/Eczema hell,"Hey everyone, so after a month of being diagnosed with MC and having read many peoples stories here I thought it was time to share my experience and successes/failures. I first noticed the bumps as I said 4 weeks ago, about 8 or so white pearly papules up the shaft of my penis. I have Fordyce spots on my penis also, which I have had forever, but I think this is why I didn't spot the Molluscum earlier. The early stage MC looks very similar to fordyce spots. I also had thrush at the same time I was diagnosed with MC, which makes me wonder if this may have influenced the ferocity of the initial break out? My immune system has definitely been run down recently, which I think is a contributing factor to the spread. I booked in with a dermatologist right away and she told me not to worry as its very common in adults nowadays due to sexual transmission. She then went on and curetted (removed the cores with a tool) the ones that were visible.   I must mention that my anxiety was really peaked by my MC diagnosis and I noticed very faint bumps all over my body. I wasn't sure if they were normal or early molluscum.  I showed the derma and she said it just looked like general skin irritation... so I felt reassured. Fast forward a week and 6 more came up in my pubic region and the ones up my torso were looking more and more like MC. So I decided to go to a new derma. He told me they were still too early to call but then froze the new ones that had come up on my penis and pubis. I went back the following week and he positively ID'd the ones on my torso as MC... my worst nightmare! not only that but my skin was giving me real trouble pretty much all over my body. Dry and irritated, sometimes flakey. I've always had sensitive skin but not full blown eczema, but it looks like the MC infection has made my skin react and in turn that reaction has contributed to the widespread of my infection. I have some acne on my body normally but now I just freak out at every blemish or bump that comes up! My anxiety is through the roof and I feel extremely depressed. I just want this nightmare to be over... The derma gave me Hydrogen Peroxide 1% cream to apply to new lesions as the come up and ordered me to come back in 4 weeks. I don't think I will leave it that long though. Lesions in my pubic area seem to mature a lot quicker than the ones anywhere else on my body. Has anyone else experienced this? I'll keep you all up to date with my progress. I'd love to speak to any other MC sufferers. Feeling very alone right now.   I change my bedding every night, new clothes every day and every night when I go to bed. I use dermol 500 instead of soap in the shower. I even wear latex gloves when I clean the affected areas in the shower.. then I use paper towels and a hair dryer to dry my body. I haven't had sex or even masturbated since this all began in fear of spreading it.  Yet it STILL spreads!  I've removed all things in my diet that may affect my immune systems function i.e. Caffeine, added sugar etc, and I've been taking Vit C, Zinc, B6 & D3.  I'm not going to let MC win though. We'll all be free of this awful thing someday, and I hope that day is just around the corner. We can do this!  0 likes, 10 replies "

My daughter had it in the creases of her arms, one arm was so bad it had up to 20.She had this for about a year before I decided I HAD to do something. Some were big and red and some were small, just starting out. I learned there are 4 different stages to this virus. The last stage is where they get big and red, and nasty looking. I was told to leave it alone but they only got worse, and spread more! So this Is what we did to heal them within 4 weeks. I created a scrub from Epsom Salt, a splash of Apple Cider Vinegar, coconut oil, and about 10 drops of Tea tree oil. We scrubbed the area morning and night. After this step we soaked a cotton ball in apple cider Vinegar, and dabbed the area, which really burned so be careful. I let this dry out, then I whipped up part coconut oil, and tea tree oil, used a Q-Tip to spread this around. Healed in 4 weeks! When they show the little white part in the middle I made sure to really scrubbed them, and really rubbed the ACV because this is the part the is contagious. Sometimes it would bleed. I also think by opening them up with the scrub, helped the healing AVC and tea tree oil get in there and wipe out the virus. 0 likes, 3 replies "
Molluscum Contagiosum,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-cured-my-moluscum-contagiosum-very-quickly-668456,I cured my moluscum contagiosum very quickly,"Hello. Skip ahead if you want to see how I did it. Some backstory. I am an Australian. I went to volunteer overseas but right before I left I noticed some peculiar bumps on the back of my neck. They weren't itchy, but they were just... there. I wasn't too concerned about them, but I already had other skin conditions such as  , eczema, and   so I asked my Dermatologist and he diagnosed me with 'moluscum contagiosum'. I asked him what I should do about it and he told me don't worry, it'll just go away. Well... I'm NEVER going back to that Dermatologist ever again, but how grateful I am that I got diagnosed while I was at home and I was able to see how other people tried treating it. Anyways, I was in Laos first where it was hot and I was sweaty and I started to scratch the back of my neck where the moluscum was. Naturally, it started to spread. It went all around my neck and behind my ears but thankfully not my face. It also went along the arms where the elbow is (an area that is particularly eczema-heavy for me). I started looking up what to do. Apple Cider Vinegar, oils, even considered using a knife. It sort of worked? But not really. When one pearly bump went red (apparently a sign that it's on the way out), three more fresh ones spawned around it. I was so depressed because everyone could see it and it was one of those things that everyone sees but no one talks about. Except a shopkeeper in Indonesia who said 'What's wrong with your skin?' It was dreadful. I was so, so, so terrified that I was going to pass it on to the people I was volunteering with or a student.  HOW I CURED IT So by this point approximately 5 months had passed, I was volunteering in Bali, Indonesia and it was at it's worst. Hundreds of bumps all around my neck and arms, undeniable. But.. I read online that someone cured their kid by having them play in the sand at a beach. Well, I was in Indonesia living right beside a beach so I thought it was worth a shot. I literally walked onto the beach, grabbed some  , and rubbed it over my body in the affected areas. Basically  with sand for about 10 minutes. I did this for a couple of days and then almost IMMEDIATELY all the bumps with the white pearly goop inside them changed to red and started vanishing. No more bumps started appearing either. After just a couple of weeks it all disappeared, so I would say I had moluscum contagiosum for 6 months total. I hope someone finds this helpful. The sand at the beach I was at was  and I have no idea if that's significant or not. I really hate the idea of getting someones hopes up and it turns out that it doesn't work for them.  I wish everyone that reads this all the best. One thing I will say is that I came out of this a stronger person. I know there are people that had this way longer than I did and I can't fathom how brave you must be. This broke me, crying on multiple occasions wondering 'why me?' You will make it through this. 1 like, 0 replies "

Molluscum Contagiosum,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/tips-treatment-for-molluscum-very-detailed--635779,Tips/Treatment For Molluscum (Very Detailed),"I am writing this to try and help someone because I know how horrendous this virus is and just would like to put some tips out there. This is going to be very long and detailed so grab a snack.  A little background- I am a 22 year old female and had Molluscum in the genital region for about a year which I have just finally gotten rid of (I hope). First off, I know how absolutely sh*tty it is to find out you have this virus. It is horrible to deal with and drags on forever which is absolutely depressing. It has pretty much made my abstinent because I do not want to tell anyone that I have it and am so afraid to pass it on. BUT what I want to say is this: It could be worse! I know that may not be what you want to hear but I am so grateful that was wasn't something more serious- Molluscum goes away   It may take forever but at least it is not life long. When Molluscum first appeared for me I was certain it was herpes, and although it does suck to have Molluscum Contagiosum I was very relieved to find out it was not HSV. TIPS: As mentioned I have been dealing with this for about a year but noticed around 6 months that it was beginning to clear up, or lessen in severity.  1. MOST IMPORTANT: DO NOT STOP TREATING. I would get frustrated or lazy and decide to ""ignore"" the Molluscum for a while instead of treating them daily and that was the absolute worst decision. Inevitably, the Molluscum got waaaay worse and harder to treat during these periods. I know sometimes you may want to give up or ""take a break"" from treating like I did but trust me you must stay consistent if you want to keep it under control/get rid of it faster. 2. No baths/hot tubs/hot water. Avoid bathes at all costs. Any heat/wet makes the Molluscum so much worse and I have noticed bathes can also make the Molluscum transfer to another part of your body. Avoid the area being moist and warm as much as possible which I know can be hard when dealing with down there. Try to take quick lukewarm showers if possible because this will definitely be a huge help in keeping the MC under control. Once you get out pat the affected area dry with toilet paper or tissue and DO NOT use the towel you are using for your body. Because Molluscum is so incredibly contagious and easily spread it is vital to not touch clothing or towels to the affected area and then touch anywhere else on the body. 3. Take a good multi-vitamin/keep up a healthy lifestyle. Eat well, excersize, sleep well, drink plenty of water and take a really good must-vitamin to help build up your immune system. The worse the immune system, the harder MC will be to get rid of. 4. WASH WASH WASH. Wash your sheets as often as possible in hot water. Buy comfy lose-fitting underwear that you can wash and bleach the sh*t out of and change often. Never use a towel twice or wear the same pants without washing because this will cause it to spread. Wash your hands before and after every time you touch the affected area.  5. DO NOT SHAVE THE AREA. This causes the MC to spread so badly and multiply like crazy. Do not even think about shaving the area until you are 100% that the MC is gone. Trim your pubes if need be in order to treat the MC. TREATMENT: *This is what worked for me* I see lots of forums on here recommending doing little amateur surgery on the molluscum at home to dig them out. I don't recommend this unless you are super confident about it, I have tried it and left me with some gnarly scars that took forever to fade, same with the Nitrogen freezing at the doc's office, which I found to not be effective enough to be worth it.  1. APPLE CIDER VINEGAR: Very effective if used properly. Helped me finally kick this thing in the butt. -Take a small cotton ball or half cotton ball and dip in ACV, squeeze out excess.  -Take a strip of duct tape and place the small ball in the centre -Place carefully on any big Molluscums and leave overnight The more tediously you do this the better the outcome, if you get the duct tape too wet it will not stick. Best results if the ACV dipped ball is squeezed out so it is not dripping wet and the tape has been secured all the way around it without gaping. After a couple nights of this you will notice the Molluscum(s) turn black and die. This then turns into a scab which goes away with time. 2. Tea-Tree Oil: Not quite as effective as ACV but still got very good results. I would do this at least every day sometimes I did this multiple times a day and it worked very well to dry up the Molluscums, causing many of the little ones to go away (ACV better for big ones).  -Take a clean Q tip, dip in the TT oil and smother any Molluscums with it. Simple and easy to do. Change Q tips in between Molluscums!!! 3. Tape: Also had a lot of success with this. -Take packing or duct tape and cut into size appropriate squares, cover the molluscums -Leave this overnight, it suffocates them and can help kill them -For big areas with many little ones I would just use one big strip of tape and for the larger Molluscums I would cut the tape into individual squares. I tried epsom salts bathes in cool water and that had virtually no effect for me. The three treatments above are what worked the best for me and I think I would definitely still be dealing with Molluscum if not for them. Hope this helps and keep on keepin' on.   0 likes, 13 replies "
Molluscum Contagiosum,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/how-i-healed-my-molluscum-contagiusum-672737,How I healed my Molluscum Contagiusum,"So I suffered from MC in my genital area. I will keep this brief since you are probably stressed while reading this. Sexual activity: I was sexually active in Nov 2017. Symptoms: I tend to be pretty self aware and check myself out regularly down there. I noticed two pale colored formations under my skin in Feb 2017. I decided to squeeze one out like a pimple and let the other one stay. The one I sqeezed out became inflamed, but disappeared after 2 weeks. The other one turned into 3 pale spots within 2 months. Oh I wish I had squeezed both out. Diagnosis: In May 2018, I was stressed about exams, so naturally my immune system was weakened and I noticed pimple like growths where the pale spots were. I immediately stopped shaving and did some research online realizing I had MC. For about 2 months the MC was spreading. When your immune system is weakened, this disease spreads like wild fire. So spreading continued into July 2018. In total I had around 12 papules.  Cure: This part truly works. Trust me! The products below should be applied at your own discretion. I am also not advertising for them. They simply worked on me, and I will explain why they can help you. Step 1: Get your immune system up and strong again. No more smoking, no more McDonalds junk. Get yourself some ""Comprehensive Immune Support"" by Mycommunity. It's sold on Amazon. And take two capsules every day. It will make your immune system much stronger within a few weeks. Step 2: Start using tea tree soap when you shower. And when you get out of shower, use a separate towel to dry the infected area. Keep your genitals dry. Apply baby powder! Step 3: Buy a Compound W Freeze Off Advanced. You want to freeze off the MC papules with cryotherapy. It doesn't hurt. The mental burden of having MC is worse than the freeze off pain. Remember to get the Compound W with the small tip. You don't want to kill healthy skin cells unnecessarily.  Step 4: Burn those m*****f*****. The bottle says apply for 40 secs? Don't worry, the pharmaceuticals have factors of safety of 5.  Hold on for a minute. Make sure the papule gets frozen = meaning the virus will be killed.  Step 6: After a week, the area will heal and there won't be any signs of MC. When the papule gets inflamed and turns white, it means you killed it and now your body is removing it!!! You may notice new papules forming. That's because you spread the virus before. Papules form a few weeks after the virus has already spread to fresh skin. So don't freak out. Burn it off again. Within a month you should be clear. And the freeze off scarring will go away after 1-2 months.  This cure will take 1 month. If you don't do it, you could have MC for up to a year. Thank me a later. The sooner you burn those b******s, the sooner you will heal. Every papule will heal on its own, but chances are that they will spread before healing. So killing them is the best choice.  0 likes, 1 reply "
Molluscum Contagiosum,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/how-i-beat-molluscum-contagiosum-in-1-week-for-less-than-10--677734,HOW I BEAT MOLLUSCUM CONTAGIOSUM IN 1 WEEK FOR LESS THAN $10.,"Wanted to post this to help anyone else struggling with this awful infection: I had about 30-40 sores in my genital area and was able to achieve clear skin in 1 week. No medicine, no dermatology appointments, just some reading online to get some background information on the infection. If you have less sores, or in a more accessible area, this method only gets easier with an even higher likelihood of success. Other forums or doctors will tell you not to pop them because if people try to do it without understanding the gravity of the situation or the need for meticulous control of what touches what, they can make it worse.  -Some toilet paper (really hoping you all have this anyway) -a bottle of 70-90% isopropyl alcohol or rubbing alcohol (~$2) -metal tweezers with a sharp flat tip(~$3-5), like one for plucking eyebrows or something -neosporin, triple antibiotic, or any other ointment that would be used for minor wound treatment -any flashlight or phone light -In my early 20s, male -Studying medicine so pretty well informed on how all of this works (i.e. transmission, why a physician would warn you of certain things to do/not do, etc.) -Probably got the initial infection in my genital area through sexual contact, first noticed 1-2 pimple-like bumps right above my penis around June. My guess is that they spread when I shaved, because I went right over them and didn't think anything of it because I used get a decent amount of acne in occasionally random spots like on my leg or shoulder.  -Weeks later, now July, they began sprouting up all over the area...all over the pubic region, down around my gooch, scrotum and penis shaft - I had about 30 in total. I went to my internist, who took one look and immediately wrote down ""mulloscum contagiosum"" and told me that I should go to a dermatologist that he recommended. -Because a dermatologist's methods for removing the infection is technically considered a procedure, they will charge $100s in multiple sessions if your infection is as bad as mine was. Plus, the less severe your infection is, the easier my method is for proper execution and successful results. My treatment was a modified at-home form of the curette treatment, some also freeze them off or prescribe medicine.  1. Know there will be some blood. Not really pain, because the sores aren't innervated and so not sensitive, but blood.  2. YOU HAVE TO BE METICULOUS 3. You MUST treat  visible infection sore as described below as you notice them. I spent about 2 hours (keep in mind I had  ) the first day, then about 30 minutes a day for two days after that going through and methodically treating each sore. Since the third day, however, and now for about 1 month, haven't seen a single one. I waited to post this to make sure they wouldn't return, and I still comb over the area every couple days with a flashlight to ensure no new ones are coming.  Step 1. Sterilize area where sores are by dipping toilet paper in alcohol and rubbing around the entire area. Step 2. Take a lighter to the end of the tweezers, then dip in alcohol.  Step 3. Squeeze the tweezers together around the white tipped sore  the level of the white tip (same as you would a pimple to ensure squeezing out all the contents). While squeezing harder than you think you should, pull up. If done correctly, you will see the white/yellow colored pill-shaped waxy core that contains the infectious agent and maybe some blood on the tweezers. Wipe this on a sheet of toilet paper.  Step 4. Dip the tweezers in alcohol, set aside Step 5. Wipe the sore you just squeezed with toilet paper to remove any blood, then dab wound with alcohol, there might be some burning but that's good! It means you went deep and with almost 100% removed all of the sore and maybe even some skin.  Step 6. Using a Q-tip or your finger, dab some neosporin or substitute and cover the wound Step 7. Repeat Step 2-6 until every visible sore has been treated. I found that using a flashlight to look over the area helped to reveal some of the smaller ones, because they have a waxy, shiny finish to them that reflects in the light. Don't stop until you can't find any more.  Step 8. Repeat this process of examining the area for several days or until you feel comfortable to ensure no new ones are coming in and were missed the first day. You can also feel free to retreat every wound with neosporin every day although this might be overkill.  Other helpful suggestions: In the days after you begin doing this, I would wash your bath towel every day. Do not touch the area. Wash your hands frequently, change articles of clothing that touch the area twice a day. No sexual activity.  I know at first glance this looks like a lot but when you consider that it's one week of serious care max for a bad case like mine, in exchange for treating the infection swiftly and not having to spend serious money, wait months for the infection to pass on its own or even get worse, or play a guessing game with some of the BS home remedies like dieting or putting erosive chemicals on the skin that people promise worked for them and took months, this one week treatment plan is a very rewarding and efficient way to get rid of mulloscum. Remember that it's not the end of the world if you have it! I was incredibly stressed about the prospect of waiting months for this infection to pass until I decided to try and treat it aggressively, and it paid off! 0 likes, 0 replies "

Molluscum Contagiosum,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/molluscum-is-ruining-my-life-i-need-help-604207,"Molluscum is ruining my life, I need help ","I'm at my wits end and lowest point so far in my 7 months of living with MC. I am a 23 year old female and I contracted it from protected sex. It started on my genitals but just a few. I confused them with razor burn and just moisturized the area. It wasn't until I had a few bumps on my inner thighs too that I really began to worry. I went to the doctor because I thought I had herpes or an STD. The doctor nearly immediately told me it was MC and that it wasn't a big deal.  She guessed I had had it for a month or two as that was the last time I'd had sex and when I first noticed ""razor burn"". She said they would go away in time. I was worried but she calmed me. She didn't even warn me not to have sex or talk about how contagious it is. I broke down and went home for the weekend. My mom ordered tea tree oil and   at the recommendation of my doctor. I began putting it on and for the most part they did start to scab and fade. I'd been taking care of it but it seemed like it was clearing up. I was wrong. In that time I started shaving again and stupidly used the same razor on my legs as my underarms and privates. I also was moisturizing a lot, spreading the MC all over my arms and legs. I have small legions of probably 10 or less on my upper arm and butt. I have what look like several new ones coming in on my chest, forearms, and sprinkled on my thighs and legs. I feel covered and disgusting, they're all over me. They're not huge bumps but it's awful.  I have been trying ACV, tea tree oil, and bandaging them up. Some of my skin is raw and red from a reaction to a latex waterproof bandage, does anyone know how to soothe this? I just don't know what to do. I'm going to the doctor Friday with my mom but when I scheduled the appointment today a nurse later called and said my doctor said that it ""will go away on it' own"" dismissively but agreed the to see me. I ordered something called     Occidentalis that is by mouth 3 times a day. I also ordered   MC treatment cream. I'm going to try them and hope for the best but everything just seems to be getting worse. Advice? Kind words? Anything please Also. When they are very red and you can see the white core, what should you do to it? Keep treating it? Bandage it up? Poke it? I want to have my mom poke it or have a derm freeze or cut them when they're white like that. I worry about spreading the MC when popping them. Is there a safe way?

I'm finding it hard to live my life because of this disease. I went to the doctor about 5 months ago once I noticed the bumps, originally I just thought they were shaving marks, but they stayed there after weeks and hardened. The doctor spent about an hour scraping the warts off (which was painful as f**k) so he could send the scrapings back to the lab. Once he got the results, he called me and told me it was MC, and there was no treatment for it except the scraping method. I contacted my insurance and found out there was some topical solution for getting rid of the warts. I've been using it for about 3 days now and it's making my skin dry up down there. Now for the social aspect of this. I'll go out with friends and sometimes one of my girl friends (as in a girl who is my friend) will bring their friends and we'll end up hooking up. But It's getting real tiresome to explain to everyone who I consider attractive that I can't go back to their place with them. This sucks. This is my 20's here, I can't go through it with some awful disease which is going to limit my ability to socialize or develop relationships. I've had the disease for about 5 months now and my summer is about to start. I don't want to have to go through the whole summer having to limit the amount of fun I have because I'm not clean down there. I'm suffering entirely too much   to try to talk to someone in hopes of a serious relationship because I'm sure they'll just stop talking to me if I tell them I have this disease. And they'll have to find out sooner or later because they'll wonder why I don't want to take off my pants. I'm very grateful for the life I have lived so far, and I know we all have to go through our hardships, but this just flat out sucks. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this illness or any other recommendations for treatment? I really don't want to have this for the rest of the summer. Thanks.   0 likes, 12 replies "

I've always had a very mild OCD that had me, say, checking door handles four, eight or twelve times and looking at the eyes on any teddies etc when I left rooms. Annoying things, sure, but managable. Following a Staph aureus /   infection in my leg that formed an ulcer and was left unattended for 4 months by doctors because they said they couldn't help as it was closed up, leading to it being very hard to get rid of and several horrible doctor's visits where they struggled to realise why both my legs were going red (a venous problem, in the end), I developed very acute and serious OCD. There's now no infection, the wound is closed up and I'm wearing compression stockings for a while to help my vein valves. The docs say there's no infection but I don't believe them because sometimes it feels warm?  And because of how badly I've been treated for it last time. At home I can't touch my legs. I panic and can't touch anything they've touched, or things that touch things that they've touched. For example, I lean my leg on the arm of the sofa to put on the socks, but then my uncle leaned a plate on that arm of the sofa and I couldn't touch it. It's in the think with fairy liquid and hot water and my cup is in the same sink. I can't wash them up. I can't think of drinking from my cup anymore even though if there was any infection the fairy would kill it? And there isn't any infection anyway? The logic is all there but I can't... It's ruining my life. I can't touch half my house. I feel sick and panicy all the time. I'm staring therapy on the 12th but I just can't... function.

Starting back in college working at my laptop for hours underneath the dorm fluorescent tube lights, I feel like I began to have dimmer vision.  My college days we're moderate drinking, sometimes a lot, and almost all computer work.  I started interning in 2015 at my current desk job full time during the summer and then part time during school. In 2017 I started full time and feel like it's all been down hill from there.  I would come home from work feeling the effects of the day, and the only thing that would sort of remedy it would be sleep.  Fast forward to today, and I pretty much feel that way all the time.  It is very hard to describe the way one feels.  It is a derealization/trance like state with sporadic disassociation.  It is almost like my life is a lie.  I talk to co workers under the lights and it is almost a dream like state, and hard to focus on them.  I feel like I had severe tunnel vision when I was wearing my glasses back in 2017 at work, but have now been wearing contacts at work for almost a year.

It's been a long time since she and her husband got to that decision so it's been a year or two how i was dealing with the daughter of the husband. Now, there is no DNA connection, they were just both divorced and got together and the kids(like me) were from the past marriages. The topic here is his daughter(or my step-sister, i don't go by those names because she doesn't have the genes of my mother but whatever). She is about 13-14 years old and back a year or two when she was even younger, i never thought about mature behavior coming from her because she was a kid. Now, in about 14 i would say, she has the same behavior that irritates me to the bone. It's hard to explain without extreme details but i will try. She always asks stupid, irrelevant questions that are funny to her almost as taboo but yet interesting to her. Some of the common, frequent questions: ""Do you have a girlfriend?"", ""Do you kiss your girlfriend?"", ""Can you wake me up if something funny happens outside so i can get up and see what's funny?"", ""Your dad is not your dad, my dad is your real dad."", ""Will you be coming to my party?""...The questions are always followed by weird smiles with bent heads almost like a psychopathic feel.  These are just the basic questions, some occur that are quite private based on family and my decisions. Like, she once asked me if i would be in a relationship with my own sister, and sometimes will i be in a relationship with a person i don't even know. I think most of those are from her world that she has in her head, as things occur she sees but i don't. Her physical behavior is also weird. She has no interest in any clothing, technology, food, places even relationships and boys and etc...She is quite generic as a person i would say and i cannot have any communication with her longer then ""Hi"" as we have nothing to talk about. Her movement is rather clumsy and pretty weak for her age. She cannot do 2 things at once most of the time. She has no speech disability, but yet, she composes sentences on a ""Hey, i think you are retarded so i will speak on a pretty slow and quite basic"" level. She lives in Norway now with her mother and when she comes here, it's like we are taboo people on a way ""We are not interesting, we are different"". Things she mostly does is interact with people on this weird way and is as home as like she doesn't have any friends here( and she moved to Norway just about 2-3 years ago). She cares about privacy, but not others which is selfish, i know. I was thinking about   but she is not depressed as far as i see. Any answers because i need them? I need to know how to talk to this kid, i don't want her near me because i am not used to those kinds of people, i have no interest in that person(she comes once or twice a year to visit her father so i don't need to think about long term interactions but i am interested as this behavior is something i have never seen in my life) and i don't want to hurt someones feelings because her father is with my mother and it would be a problem if i made a mistake. This is all out of interest. I really don't want to sound like a bad person judging someone, this behavior of hers has be confirmed by multiple people but i am just curious what it is.

It takes me an hour to get out of bed in the morning because my legs won't lift. I try my hardest, then relax for a few seconds and then try again, over and over until it finally works. I'm on sick leave from school because of all of this. I've tried both SNRI and SSRI medications, as well as various anti-  medications, with no success. I've even had 10 sessions of electroconvulsive therapy with no success as far as my depression goes; the OCD, however, has gone away a bit. Today me and my mother met my doctor who explained to us that my depression is psychologically based rather than biological and that it will go away even though it doesn't feel like it. I can't believe the last thing he said. How is it supposed to go away if it's existed for 20 years without ever getting any better? How much longer should I have to wait for my overall mental and physical well-being to improve? He's now decided not to give me any more ECT sessions. He even said it's not my fault. How is it not my fault? I understand that mental illnesses can be complex in nature. It would be nice if someone could explain how my depression could be psychological, especially if it's not my fault. I would also like to know what I can personally do to make my situation better.

Mental Health,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/can-insurance-companies-override-a-psychiatrists-decision--697323,can insurance companies override a psychiatrists decision?,"i have   and am on conservatorship. im doing really well on my meds for the past 5 years or so. no meds have changed, been added nor dosages increased or lowered in that time. just 1 injection of abilify a month and a vit D pill once a week. i asked my psychiatrist if he could lower my injection dose  (which is already a low one, 400mgs) if anything to see if i would do just as well on a lower dose and eventually wean me off of it completely. he agreed and said he doesnt usually accept such requests but he loves doing it and that i was a perfect candidate. my conservator approved it too as she oversees all of my med changes but the order wasnt approved by MediCal. this is my issue im bringing here because only answer ive gotten from my doctor, nurse and other mental health workers is along the lines of ""sometimes it just turns out that way"" what reason would MediCal refuse an order by a doctor if im already on the medication and its a smaller dose?  my hunch is that them or the medication company (not sure how all that business is handled) wont be making as much money due to selling me less of the medication. and for the record its a very expensive medication from what ive been told by my nurse, upwards 2000 us dollars per injection. even if money is not the reason, how is medical allowed to override my psychiatrist's decision to lower my medication dose. all thoughts and input gladly accepted whether you are a medical professional or not. thanks 0 likes, 1 reply "

Mental Health,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-can-t-seem-to-quit-cutting--696866,I can’t seem to quit cutting.,"... I’ve been a cutter since I was about 13. I started because I just had no idea how to express my feelings, and I felt that if I cut, then people would see I had negative feelings. When I got older, 14/15 I became suicidal, and I was cutting constantly for the same reason - I wanted people to see the pain I felt. I overcame this with time and stopped until I was 17. My   had started again, and I picked up cutting. This went on until I completed school when I was 18. Once I was done with school, I stopped more or less. There were times, maybe once every couple months or so, I relapsed and would make a few cuts. I’m now 19, nearly 20, and I’m finding it extremely hard to quit. Unfortunately, I’ve picked up cutting heavily since the summertime of 2018. Every time I feel particularly strong negative emotions, I cut. Not for attention or anything, but it makes me feel better. Usually half an hour to an hour after cutting, I don’t feel the negative emotion nearly as strong, if not at all. I’ve spoken to my doctor about the possibility of having depression several times. A few times in high school, which they passed off as “normal for a teenager”, and again after I was done with school. That time, they’re explanation was “there is probably nothing wrong, pills and therapy will not help you.” This has forced me into believing there’s nothing mentally wrong with me. I’m nearly 20, and I still have streaks of intense emotional distress. I also have streaks of highs though too- its difficult to explain, and I don’t think it’s important for this discussion. I just don’t know how to stop cutting! Help? 0 likes, 2 replies "

Mental Health,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/is-this-normal-behaviour-for-a-therapist--698592,Is this normal behaviour for a therapist??,"So, I have know him for 3 years now. He was quite distant from me at first since he was speculative about my behaviour and therefore he was hesitant to be close and share anything with me. 3 years later, we are really close. He told me that he worries about me out of work hours and on Mother’s Day he was thinking of me because he lost his mom and I have lost mine too; last year when I was 15, so it’s pretty recent. He discloses things about his personal life every now and then. He keeps on saying “you’re so mature now”, which he is right, considering a few years back I would act like a little kid. We were doing a vocabulary test and he said “ogle - a thing you do when you see an attractive young lady” and he stared at me in the eyes and smirked, it made me chuckle. I guess some people, men in particular, make flirtatious jokes and y’know... they’re funny f ck? Where did that come from? I looked at my psychiatrist and she looked at me and my dad, that’s when my therapist quickly retracted what he just said by saying “I’m joking I’m joking I’m joking” but it just caused an awkward silence accompanied by my uncomfortable giggles. Many times he has contradicted himself, he says “when I go home at the end of the day I don’t think about you” then other times he said “I was up all night worrying about you”, I know he has his own issues and that’s why I care about him so much, he’s my best friend and I wish I could just give him a big hug because I can see the pain in his eyes, but I’m so lost on why he says some inappropriate things? Back when me and him didn’t like each other, he never said a nice word in my defence, but he even admitted to my dad that he ‘gets attached easily with some of his patients’ and that leaves me wondering, why mention that to MY dad? Can I have some feedback please? Ask any questions that may come to your mind, thank you! XXX 0 likes, 19 replies "

Mental Health,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/unusual-and-extreme-personality-change-while-drinking-698835,Unusual and extreme personality change while drinking,"First and foremost I drink. A lot less than I use to but due to metabolism, genetics, and tolerance (and gods know what else) a normal tame night of drinking is a bottle of whiskey, some friends, and good times. The moment in question was a few nights ago (now I've asked this in another section for some varied answers so apologizes on the repeat) but after a couple of hours and about a 1/4 of what a normal night of drinking is for me. I passed out, woke up a few minutes later and I was not the one driving my meat suit around. About a dozen witnesses, hours of extreme personality traits and swaps. I was violent and punchy, the world's craziest child stunt devil, a gymnast, then a chatterbox. (over the course of about 12 hours) I was lucky enough to have people watching over me and I've drank with them before. I do not say this lightly, they were f*****g terrified of me. One even called poison control thinking I had been drugged. I've been drunk and stupid dozens of times, I've never had wild, abusive, or child like personalities manifest and throw themselves around a room like that. Now the damage is done, the scars are mine to bear, if I'm lucky only one person will never speak to me again, and I'm just a total jackass in front of a dozen people I sadly hangout with in a weekly basis. My question is, was I drugged (as some signs and symptoms are pointing to yes but I like clear cut evidence) or did my brain fracture in some weird personality aspect? We're all different people when we drink but I'm usually the same drunk person not a half dozen random ones. Now, over 20 years of drinking and stupidity, I've been sick, I've p****d myself before, I've done the normal range of drunken dumbass f** kery. The next morning I woke up sore and that was it. Due to puncture wounds and gashes from a fall but that was it. No pukeage at any point, no sickness, no hangover, no.... anything. A quarter of the normal amount I drink, EXTREME personality switches, and no ill side effects? That ain't right. That is mind blowingly NOT right. Foul play levels of something went wrong. So, because I like to cover all possiblities, assuming I wasn't drugged, as I only have on suspect for that and I wouldn't put it pass them but I like clear cut evidence; what sort of mental health issue(s) causes an EXTREME personality switch after someone drinks? Keep in mind I've drank plenty before and this is a literal first. A terrifying literal first. I have/ have had mental health issues in the past. I've dealt with s t happen to me because of. Aside from that moment, I've never had personality issues. As in multiple personalities, voices in the head, etc. So I have literally no f*****g clue what causes this. I need answers and I got nothing but I do have a couple dozen people asking me like I should know and I don't have a clue. Having to apologize to someone, for doing something to them that scared them, when you have no memory of it, of why you would, or how you managed to if you were black out drunk when you have zero history of it and have never had a moment like this in your life. It's beyond embarrassing and it's certainly terrifying. Just looking for insight, answers, whatever I can get. 0 likes, 0 replies "

There is absolutely no way to lay on my sides,   I can't find a comfortable way to lay in bed at all,  so I'm up and down like a yo yo,  lucky  to get an hour and a half sleep at a time,  I am so tired!   In the day the pains ease a little bit, it depends what I'm doing,  walking hurts,  lifting my legs in and out of the car hurt,  climbing stairs hurt,   getting up or down to a kneeling position hurts.      My knees, ankles and feet are the only part of my legs that don't hurt!!   I mentioned all this to my specialist during my last appointment but he said it was probably down to the statins that I was taking, so I stopped them for two months and it made no difference at all,  the pains are just getting worse and worse, I dread going to bed.    I was on predisolone for my PMR and as I was reducing the dose the leg pains started. The specialist told me to go back on them but I don;t want to mask the pain, I want to know what's causing it.

I slowly got in the shower and as the water hit me i started to cry. I am 44 why has my life turned to the worst i thought to myself. After getting ready i made myself a smoothy and took my vitamins and made my way to the coach. I turned on the tv and watched a interview with Celine Dion. She was talking on her show coming to an end in Vegas in June. She was happy, smiling. As i sat there watching this interview i asked myself how do these celebs do it. They get up early to do rehearsal then make it on stage every night. Dance and sing for 2 hrs. Then there are the actresses who are on set daily. What in earth are they doing that we are not. I feel like there is no life in me. Its such a beautiful day outside after a long winter and i wish for my old self that would be out there enjoying it. I will have to resort to sitting in the back, hoping that these symptoms ease up so i can take a walk around the block. i am crying writing this. this forum is all i have and my son. I feel that everyone is tired of me complaining and not feeling well. i pretend to be ok when people call.Have you ladies ever wondered about these celebs, or is just me.

And major surgery besides scaring me isn't really an option with my current job and being single. Which is the other thing. I'm 47 still single, no retirement savings or major savings, working 2 jobs, my family isn't very supportive or well off, my friends are all off in their own lives and marriages and I think, what's the point when now my health is falling apart??? How can anything get better? Why haven't I met someone by now or found a great paying job? I'm a good, kind, intelligent being. Am I just fundamentally flawed. Am I the only one? It seems like as an old therapist said to me, everyone else has at least one table leg, like a husband, or money or their health, or a good job etc. What does it say about me that I have none of these at 47 not to mention I owe more on my student loans now then I did when I graduated thanks to interest and being out of work a lot from freelancing, layoffs, the contractor economy and not being in a high-paying field.

I mentioned last time that my bleeding was super heavy, passing blood clots about 3 inch long and having absolutely no break in between bleeding!

I ended up staying in over night so they could put me on a drip to slow my bleeding down. The next morning the head gynecologist came to see me and his verdict was that one of my ovaries was enlarged and this could mean i either have cysts on my ovary or polycistic ovary syndrome. He even said ""we cant see exactly what it is because there is too much blood in the way"" brilliant, so that made me lose confidence. They discharged me and said if i dont have another period i must go see the gynecologist in February!!! However, i have been bleeding again for weeks so i went back to my doctors and told to wait until Feb! I will add my surgery is useless, you never see the same doctor and they have a 1 star rating on google. I feel so alone and im absolutely fed up of feeling and seeing blood!

They've always been very irregular but I'm currently having the longest cycle since I had my son 3 yrs ago. I've been diagnosed with secondary   and am under investigation due to   on my cervix and enlarged ovaries. My gyny gave me Provera in December to induce a bleed (take for 5 days). I had hoped it would come naturally but I haven't had a period now for 5 months, so decided to start the Provera on Sunday. Problem is I've had severe cramping since yesterday and I'm absolutely exhausted - can barely stand up or keep my eyes open by 6pm. Is this usual to feel this way? I wasn't advised of any side effects so wasn't sure what to expect! 0 likes, 2 replies "

I'm probably overreacting/overthinking like I usually do... but I'm a little nervous because this hasn't ever happened before. I've had my period for about 6 years now, and I've never missed until now... Today is April 4th, and the first day of my last period was February 19th (so my cycle is 45 days so far.) My head is telling me something is wrong with me but I'm not having any symptoms so I'm not sure what's wrong. Like I said, of the 6 years I've had my period I have never missed once. Does anyone know what could cause this? Or have any tips on how I can get it to come back? Thank you. 0 likes, 4 replies "

About three months ago I started to feel very dizzy around my period. It lasts around 7-10 days, comes and goes and stays even adter my period has stopped. I’m not so dizzy that I can’t stand or feel like the room is spinning, it’s more subtle than that but very uncomfortable and disturbing. I also feel extremely tired during these times. It then goes away mostly and returns around my period again. I’ve had iron and bloods taken and all are clear. I also suffer from   auras which are very unpredictable and occur often. I haven’t noticed a link between the two. I’ve seen a doctor and a neurologist (for my migraines) and neither seem worried about it but can’t tell me what the   if from. It’s very upsetting not having a clear diagnosis or any idea on how to make it stop. I’d love any stories of similar symptoms that might help me work out what is going on.

I've read, with dubious authority that blurred vision may generally just be an MCAS etc. issue.  I've also had eye discomfort but never this degree of idiopathic pain.  I saw an ophthalmologist who could find no discernible issue on examination (but didn't do like tear tryptase stuff etc.).  So two tangential questions - 1)  Does anyone have experience with tear tryptase tests?  Where do you go to have that done - allergist?  Ophthalmologist? 2)  Does anyone have any experience with these symptoms - severe almost foreign object pain and acute blurring without any other discernible symptoms like fainting or  ?  (I concede the possibility this may just be the most recent peak severity of my other eye symptoms... but the blurriness isn't really tenable.) To the original question, it seems all commercial preparations of cromolyn and ketotifen eye drops have benzalkonium chloride.  I can't find for-sale single-use vials, which allegedly don't use the preservative.  But whether or not this is my issue (and I suspect it is not), how do MCAS patients who react to benzalkonium chloride get around this issue? 0 likes, 3 replies "

I can't seem to get it under control. It has been going for almost a month. I went to the allergist, saw his new NP, and she had no answers. They want me to try Allegra, but I am leery of trying another med as I had reactions to Nexium and Zyrtec. I think I have mastocytosis as my tryptase was over 20 even without reactions. Been in the ER 3 times, but they don't help. Yesterday I took my Vitamin D3 and calcium and had a reaction. I am talking about sudden feeling of doom, low bp, and I grabbed the benadryl. It pulled me out of it, but now I don't know if it was that or if my histamine levels are not being controlled by the meds. She wouldn't order any blood work. My urinalysis is showing a high pH and I'm going into ketosis, slight for now. I am limited to only a few foods I can tolerate and they are bothering me now. I am on cromolyn, Zantac, Claritin, Flonase, eye drops, and Benadryl as needed. The benadryl really helps, but don't want to use it all time. The NP said if it continues they might have to consider a food line. I said no. It is in my GI tract. I have had polyps removed that were full of lymphatic tissue and other cells, but at the time they didn't test for mastocytosis. The Immunologist is pretty sure I have it in the gut. Joy. I have constant heartburn (helped by benadryl! That's why they think the mast cells are everywhere), terrible abdominal pain, diarrhea, and now blood. I am existing on bone broth. I can't eat anything not organic. It is getting expensive. I can't take any antibiotics, antifungals, etc. I have to avoid people, even my grandchildren for fear of catching something. I see Dr. Akin at U of M in September. I am trying to stay alive until then. Any suggestions would be appreciated. My PCP just won't even consider discussing this and says go to the specialist. My gastro's office says the same thing! I am hoping Dr. Akin can suggest a good PCP and gastro who will work with him. BTW, I had a bone biopsy that just showed low ferritin, which I didn't know is a sign of mastocytosis too. I really don't want another one done, but the doctor said sometimes they miss the spot. Joy!

Symtoms - chronic cough, mucus overload which gets worse after eating, tight chest, nausea, fatigue, itchy skin, small pea size lumps on upper arms, migraines, vitamin deficient, constipation, heartburn.

My tryptase level was normal as were other mast cell markers in a urine test, but the allergist is going to treat me as if I have a mast cell disorder based on my symptoms. Nothing showed up on the food allergy skin test, although I am highly allergic to grasses and other inhalants. Here are my questions: I've had a chronic   for years, and occasionally my throat and nose will close up completely so I cannot breathe at all during a coughing spell. Eventually it will release and I am exhausted for the day. There are no hives and this does not seem to happen in response to any food or inhalant, just triggered by the random cough. Sometimes it will occur when I've been asleep for a few hours out of nowhere. The doctor is calling this   and has given a prescription for an epi pen and a rescue inhaler with directions to go to ER after an episode. Since I can't possibly inhale during these episodes, I won't be able to use the inhaler. There is no point going to ER because once it's over, it's over. Does this sound like anaphlaxis to those of you with more experience? I am wondering if the epi pen is the answer. Next, I have terrible flushing episodes at random times during the day, and they are worse at night. I always have one about half an hour after falling asleep, where I get very hot, anxious, have elevated heart rate and my hands turn bright red. My blood pressure goes down and I feel faint. A cardiologist recently diagnosed me with dysautonomia. Sometimes I sweat a lot during an episode, and last night I nearly fainted when I got up to use the bathroom. I had to lie on the floor for a while before I could get up. This is in spite of using medications. I'm now using an inhaler for the asthmawhich has helped the cough a lot and increased my lung capacity significantly. I am also taking Zyzal, Zantac, doxepin and quercetin but the night time episodes have not diminished at all. They seem to happen at the same time every night beginning around 10 p.m. I don't get hives or itching with these attacks, but I also have neuropathy and it is highly activated by an episode. I am also woken up with a mild episode when it's time to get up for the day and that irritates the nerves terribly. Does this sound like a mast cell problem or something else? The trigger seems to be changing sleep states rather than an allergen. I am happy to finally have doctors taking me seriously but am overwhelmed and confused by these episodes and not sure we have hit the target yet. I would appreciate any observations.

Ive been really struggling with coping with my symptoms and diagnosis journey for MCAS. Not really medically (although that has been difficult as well) but coping mentally has been hard. I wanted to start this discussion to meet other people going through the same thing because I feel like my family, and even my doctors, dont really understand what Im going through right now and Im just super confused about everything since I dont know anyone with this condition to compare it to. I first started with symptoms when I was 15, I ate ice cream and suddenly started feeling like someone was sitting on my chest and restricting my breathing. I went to three different allergists – all of which said that I was not allergic to dairy. I kept eating dairy (despite the fact that it usually did not turn out well for me) mostly because I was in denial about suddenly having any type of limitation. Finally, when I was 17 I decided to give up dairy all together because my symptoms were starting to get really scary. Over time I have developed an allergy to many more foods (dairy, egg, gluten, peanuts, cashews, sesame, shellfish, coffee, peas, green beans, certain strong smells, chemicals, etc). Typically what I think to be allergic reactions present themselves through shortness of breath, chest tightness, coughing, lightheartedness, dizziness, flushing/hot flash, itchy skin (but never a rash or hives), nausea or a variation of said symptoms which (if they get really bad) are typically resolved by using an epipen. Recently I have also had a lot of trouble eating since I get full very quickly and start feeling super nauseous afterwards. The thing is: I have never had hives so what if its all in my head? Could these be caused by panic attacks, although its gotten to a point when Im not even worried when I get a reaction, my thought is usually something along the lines of ""dang it, there goes my streak""? I saw an allergist who told me that it might be MCAS, but all of the tests we have done keep coming back negative: we did a test for the kit mutation as well as a 24 hr urine histamine test. My doctor decided to put me on medication for mast cell to see what happens and they have really helped. They have slightly helped reduced the amount of reactions (I went from a reaction once to twice a week to going two weeks without a reaction at times) and they have made my reactions less severe in terms of symptoms and the amount of time it takes for it to go away. I was just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience? Has anyone else had episodes where its just one symptom? Sometimes I will randomly have chest tightness but no flushing or dizziness, which I dont know if thats typical of an allergic reaction, if that is an allergic reaction. I would appreciate any advice anyone could give me on this, thanks! 0 likes, 0 replies "
Neuropathic Pain,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/pregabalin-and-gabapentin-682925,Pregabalin and gabapentin ,"Pregabalin and gabapentin are to be reclassified as Class C controlled substances from April 2019, the government has announced. The switch will come more than two years after the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs recommended that the two medicines become controlled drugs and be placed under Schedule 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 and Class C of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The medicines are used for treating neuropathic pain, seizures and anxiety, but illicit use of the drugs has increased in recent years. In June 2018, NHS Scotland figures revealed that gabapentinoids had been prescribed prior to a fifth of drug-related deaths in Scotland in 2016. Following a consultation on the status of gabapentinoids which closed in January 2018, the UK government has now decided to reclassify the medicines but not to apply the requirements for safe custody. It is illegal to possess controlled substances without a prescription or to sell or otherwise supply them to others. Under the new classification, pharmacists will not be able to accept electronic prescriptions for pregabalin and gabapentin, although an impact assessment from the government says that this “may be mitigated in the future if the Electronic Prescribing System (EPS) can be used to prescribe controlled drugs electronically instead”. A pilot scheme prescribing Schedule 2 and 3 drugs using the EPS began in October 2018. Prescriptions of pregabalin and gabapentin will also be limited to 30 days’ treatment, and repeat prescriptions will not be issued. Any prescription received must be dispensed within 28 days. Ash Soni, president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS), said in response to the reclassification that “these restrictions are designed to improve safety, and from that perspective will be recognised as a positive step by pharmacists”. But he emphasised that patients must be made aware of the changes so that they understand the new requirements for prescriptions, particularly regarding the time limits for dispensing and restrictions in prescribed quantity. “It is likely that there will be some reduction in the prescribing of these drugs and pharmacies will need support in managing their stock holding to ensure they meet patient demand, without ending up with significant stocks that go out of date,” Soni added. “Misuse of the gabapentinoids, often in combination with opioids, is becoming more prevalent and recognised in specialist drug and alcohol services”, said Graham Parsons, RPS spokesperson on misuse of drugs and chief pharmacist of the charity Turning Point. “It is always a fine balance when drugs are reclassified. Prescribers must always be cautious that the pendulum does not swing too much in the other direction leading to patients with a genuine clinical need being denied evidenced-based pharmacotherapies.” 0 likes, 9 replies "

I went to the out of hours doctor and she did my blood pressure and said nothing about it and checked the pulse in my right foot and said that it was good. She said that it was nerve entrapment but that didn't make sense to me as the pain was in both feet, but I am not a doctor so I don't know if it's possible to get nerve entrapment in both feet. The pain went away for a few days so I cancelled my doctors appointment, believing i would be fine  (now regretting this massively) and went on with my life, only for it to reappear a few days ago. I've down the awful thing of googling it and   is coming up and the word diabetes is mentioned a lot of the time. I'm only 18, and only my grandfather has diabetes and even then, he's step so it's not blood. I'm not the skinniest but I am in the process of loosing weight - I am around 12 stone the last time I checked. Is there a chance it could be diabetes or peripheral neuropathy? Symptoms include; aching, heavy feeling, sometimes a burning pain but not often, stabbing pain but with no feeling - almost like a pulse if that makes any sense. It should also be noted that both my mum and sister suffer from restless leg syndrome so I thought it could be that but RLS only occurs at night - at least that's what I think. Any information or advice would be appreciated. I'm going to ring the doctors on Monday morning and they will probably hate me but I can't keep panicking like this.

Neck Pain,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/strange-neck-and-shoulder-pain-for-8-years-what-do-i-have--603056,"Strange Neck and Shoulder pain for 8 years, what do I have?!","Hello Everyone,  I have been coping with a very unusual (so it seems) condition that has had me visit every doctor where I live, and about 8 years later, I have slightly improved but I'm still always accompanied by stiffness and pain in my neck and shoulders, all the time!.  It started when I was around 20. I would get the urge to crack my neck, accompanied by increasing pain, and a stiff stuck-like kind of feeling. It has moved around my shoulders and neck ever since, sometimes more concentrated on one side or area, but generally, pain in the whole area, felt mostly when I am tired, stressed/nervous.  I was also extremely sensitive to cold air for a while, but that has also improved in the past few years. The punchline is I STILL don't know what condition or disease I have. After countless MRI's, tests and scans which mainly showed normal or mild results, my latest doctor has put me on skeletal muscle relaxant medication for treating  , but im not really noticing a big change (almost 2 months in.) I haven't suffered any injuries or trauma that would cause this or had hurt my neck and can't think of anything else rather than stress and computer use, but even for these reasons, my scans show normal results with one of my disks 'Mildly Dehydrated"" c3-c4. Currently, my neck feels like little particles are touching the sides from within, and I can crack it in numerous directions and small hear small pops and clicks.  This has obviously become a great problem in my life and I have had to restrict my routines in many ways. It would be really helpful if I could just find someone else who has the same problem and know what it is, and how to treat it.  Any light shed on this issue would be of great help to me and I wish you all good health!    1 like, 15 replies "

Neurological Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/dystonic-tremor--692435,Dystonic tremor? ,"So for the last year I've had problems with tremors, mainly in my left hand. But it's odd, it's triggered mainly by some sort of activity, very specific activity, like cutting the hedge with shears, or holding my kids bike for them for a length of time, or holding a heavy cake for a while. Then after I'll have pretty intense tremors, for quite some time, but only in one position, like bending my wrist, or gripping. But the tremors are severe. Its a bit like when you sit with your leg on tippy toes on one side and your leg starts shaking and gets worse and worse until you put your leg down, it's like that, but ongoing. Brain scan was normal, I have uctd/lupus. I have suspected gastroparesis, I suspect heats makes it worse, enough that some days after a shower I'll have a tremor with no trigger. My movement specialist said its likely dystonic tremors. But I'm not sure it fits. I definitely suspect muscular. I had hyperthyroidism, and had a half thyroidectomy which helped a lot of other symptoms, but not this. Does anything link tremors and my gastroparesis?

Nasal Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/complete-loss-of-smell-and-taste-after-sinus-surgery-super-worried--669780,Complete Loss of Smell and Taste After Sinus Surgery-SUPER WORRIED!,"Hi everyone, Three days ago, I had sinus surgery, specifically, a septoplasty and a sinus cleaning. Pain has been minimal, but I have completely lost my ability to smell and taste. Many medical articles I've read have reassured me that this is common after surgery, but I have no sense of smell and taste, LITERALLY 0%, I probably couldn't even smell gasoline. What's really strange though is that hours after the surgery, I could taste just fine. A nurse brought me a orange popsicle and I could taste it just fine. After getting home, I ate some chocolate ice cream and I couldn't finish eating it becasue of how rich in flavor it was. So I could taste hours after the surgery, but by the evening, as I was eating dinner with my family, I couldn't taste at all. What could this mean? Three days have passed and I have no sense of smell or taste. It's gotten worse actually becasue yesterday I could still smell my perfume and a few other scents and now I really can't smell anything. I can't taste anything, not even raw sugar or potent spices. I have no desire to eat, the inability to taste freaks me out so much. Another thing I would like to mention is that while I have no sense of taste or smell, I have this constant yucky taste lingering in my mouth. It tastes like disgusting medicine and metal. What does this mean? I think it may be related to the antibiotics, since in the past, antibiotics have given me a metallic taste in my mouth and I've also experienced a temporary 50% decrease in smell from antibiotics about a year ago. Is it really necessary to take antibiotics after surgery? They just give me such bad side effects... I know I'm probably overreacting, but it's all just really scary. I know the reason why I can't smell is probably related to swelling, inflammation, the antibiotics, and congestion, but is it really normal to have a COMPLETE loss of smell and taste after surgery? I just turned 16 recently and I can't imagine living several decades without being able to taste a single bite of food.....I'd rather not live. Pathetic, I know, but I'm so sad about this, I've been crying nonstop, I want to be able to smell, I want to be able to taste chocolate and smell coffee.  I wouldn't be so worried if I still had a partial ability to smell, but I have no sense of smell at all. I wouldn't be as worried if it improved after being able to breathe through my nose, I was so congested, I thought that was the reason I couldn't smell, but after using decongestant spray, I can breathe through my nose, but I still have zero sense of smell. What could have gone wrong? Why could I smell and taste right after surgery, but not several hours later? Could there have been any sort of nerve damage?? I remember waking up and having intense burning in my nose, did something happen? I'm doing everything my doctor told me to do, I'm rinsing my nose with saline water 3 times a day and applying an antibiotic ointment. My doctor has been performing this surgery every week for nearly 20 years, so he has lots of experience. I just don't understand what's happening...I didn't know that the last meal I ate the night before the surgery could have been the last meal I'd ever taste... For anyone who's bothered to read this to this point, thank you so much. If you have had sinus surgery before, did you lose your sense of smell and taste? How long did it take for it to come back? How did you cope in the meantime? According to my research, it can take several weeks for smell and taste to come back, sometimes months, and post-surgical swelling can exist up to a year after surgery....What are the chances that this complete loss of smell and taste is permanent??? Is it really normal to have NO sense of smell after sinus surgery?  I'm sorry this turned into one long rant, I have given more details that I probably needed to give. I'm just so worried, I don't wanna live my life without the ability to smell the roses or taste.....any information or sharing of personal experiences would be appreciated, thank you so much <3 0 likes, 7 replies "

I went to see an ENT  about 10 days ago.  He told me that he is not sure what the lump is in my nose .  He stated it is about  2 mm  in size,  firm, smooth, but it is not a cyst .  He also said it is not a nasal polyp, as they normally see them further up in the nose.  He said he was 99% sure that it is not cancer, but the only way to know for sure is to do a biopsy.  Although he was fascinated by it, he did not seem  to think that it was something to worry about. He said we could do a biopsy, or wait 6 weeks and take a look at it again. and take a look at it again. I opted to wait 6 weeks. I will go see him in early January.

I'm struggling to breathe properly, its like I've got a constant cold. I'm getting headaches from it. the only solution apparently is surgery which is a last resort for me. The worst thing is my breath, and ive been to the dentist who said its not coming from bad dental hygiene. its causing a funny smell which must be coming from my nose?? please help 😦 0 likes, 1 reply "
Nasal Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/constant-inflammation-in-right-side-of-nose-ideas--646936,constant inflammation in right side of nose - ideas?,"I'm experiencing inflammation in the right side of my nose. It feels like it's in the middle + top turbinate. Some times it feels like it's burning/irritated skin inside. Other times it feels like I've been punched in the eye/nose and it's swollen. Headaches sometimes. Almost always I cannot breath through my right nostril. I've had this feeling for about 2 years. I went to an ENT dr to have it checked. He had me try Flonase for a few months, but that did not do anything. Then I had a   and he said that there is no structural problem. He suggested it was caused by clenching/grinding my jaw. I do clench my jaw, especially when I'm asleep. But, I think it's because I have pain/inflammation in my nose/face - a circular problem. I'm looking for some ideas on what's causing this and how to calm it down. I've got a bit of history… so here's more info: When I was 28, I had sinus surgery to remove a bone spur that was in the upper right of my nose and had a contact point that caused migraines (same area as the inflammation). They also straightened out my septum while they were in there. The surgery solved the migraines. I was basically problem free until about 2 years ago. I'm 39 now.  I had a baby 2 years ago, this inflammation started soon after his birth. While I was pregnant with baby, I fell down a flight of stairs and had a head injury above my eyebrow on the left side.  In the months to a year following having baby, I had dizzy spells. I went to the Dr. Blood work only showed  . Thyroid tested normal. I eventually got desperate and googled for solutions. I read about BBPV and tried the Epley maneuver and that solved the   on the first try. Since baby, I've also had a hard time maintaining my blood sugar. I breast fed for 1 year. Only recently (baby now 2 years old) have I been able to manage that better by changing my diet - reducing carbs and eating more protein and fat. That sounds obvious, but I was eating very healthy and balanced before. I have had to push it to paleo style (no refined grains, very few carbs) to feel comfortable and not starving all of the time. I am fatigued, but baby was not a good sleeper for the first full year. I get as much sleep as I can, but with jaw clenching and two small children, it's not perfect. I neti pot fairly regularly with salt water. It helps with any congestion I get, but does not get rid of inflammation. I recently went to an indoor swimming pool and had increased nasal/sinus inflammation and   on the right side and a  . It was inflamed before, the pool environment made it incredibly painful. When I have a cold, there's lots of pain/pressure/discomfort on that right side. I had a head cold a few months ago and the Dr. said my ears were very blocked with ear wax and had to clean them out in order to see my ear drum. It makes me wonder if something is going on with my ears. I am allergic to milk. I eat yogurt, butter. Small amounts of milk in cooking. Would not dare drink a glass of milk or ice cream. I used to have irritable bowels when I did drink milk... so I generally control my intake so that I have no bowel symptoms. But, I'm wondering if milk could contribute to congestion/inflammation. I also recently realized that if I sleep tilted up (with 2 pillows) I will wake up with my right nostril completely clear and air moving through comfortably with no inflammation. This makes no sense to me since I have a blocked nostril all day long. Another remedy that seems to help is inhaling steam with tea tree oil. It takes out the raw/stinging feeling. But, obviously hasn't cured it. Any ideas for what is causing this or how to reduce the inflammation would be a great help! Thank you   0 likes, 1 reply "

I don’t seem to have symptoms such as running nose, itchy eyes, sneezing, coughing...etc, but seems that I have the post nasal drip sensation most of the time, it’s like a lump or a mucus around my throat that I can neither swallow down nor   out, sometimes good sometimes bad. These are my background.  Since 4 days ago, right before my period started(don’t know if they are relevent tho) all of a sudden the symptom became very severe. The “mucus thing” seems to be stuck at a very uncomfortable location(right in between of my nasal cavity and my throat) it’s like too much discomfort and you can hardly ignore it...I swallow all the time but it never really go down and even if it does it comes back right after...and my mouth and throat became extremely dry with no saliva at all. This is ruining my life and I haven’t had a proper meal for 4 days...because everytime I tried to swallow I feel the food stuck in between my back throat and my nasal cavity, along with the mucus, and it doesn’t go down smoothly, I even have a feeling that food partially went up to my nose instead of going down. I know this can’t happen and it’s against your body design, but whenever I had this feeling I couldn’t swallow anymore food even like congee. I feel I could choke or something if something stuck in there. I went to my family doc today and he just thinks it’s caused by allergy and he sees irritation in my back throat. He gave me   and saline nasal spray. I told him I have some trouble swallowing and he ended up giving me Sandoz Ondansetron ODT which is for controlling the   feeling, but I don’t have those symptoms so really don’t know if that’s gonna do anything......I will go see an ENT for further test maybe using a endoscope to see what’s going on. By the way, I used Apo-mometasone and Fluticasone furoate nasal sprays in the past month and stopped using them 2 days ago. It is seriously ruining my life...I loved eating and now I feel so nervous and stressful with eating. I’m hungry but just can’t eat for 3 days. I used to love all those outdoor activities but now I’m just totally in the dark and rather go sleeping because only when I’m asleep I don’t feel anything...what’s going on? Can post nasal drip cause those feelings at all?  Please if anyone ever suffering from similar problem like I do...share it with me if you have any way to get better.

Nasal Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/sinus-issues-unsure-if-it-s-post-nasal-drip-or-what--694570,Sinus Issues - Unsure if it's Post Nasal Drip or What.,"Hello It's Arily, I'm 36 and have been suffering for awhile with some sinus issues. I'm unsure if it's a post nasal drip issue, allergies, or sinus infection. I have used a Doctor app on my phone (covered by insurance) to speak with a doctor however the app is sort of a band aide and they encourage a follow-up with a Doctor in person. I however do not have this convenience as I do not have the funds to be continuously going back and forth to the Doctor. As stated the Doctor app is 100% covered by insurance but Doctor visits are not. So firstly the issues I am experiencing are: Sneezing Runny nose Clogged nose Clear HOT Mucus Fluid in Ears Sometimes a smell Some post nasal dripping I can see my adenoids in my nostrils, left side seems more visible. Remedies I have tried: Afrin nasal spray (I had became addicted, but was able to stopped taking it with a prescribed steroid from the Doctor app and haven't touched it since) Flonase (Had side effect. Throbbing headache daily) Claritin (Same side effect. Throbbing headache daily) Allegra (Same side effect. Throbbing headache daily) Zyrtec (I had thought this was working but as it turns out I think I was having a side effect that was making my condition worse. More info below) Sudafed PE Sinus and Allergy (Worked before sort of, now because I've been taking it so long I do not get the relief like I used too) Saline nasal spray (Isontonic Formula from the store and Hypotonic Formula made at home.) With the Saline nasal spray I have attempted to shoot it up one nostril with head tilted for it to come out the other like a rinse, however it will go up the nostril and right back out the same one. Never have I been able to successfully go up one and out the other. Day time issues vs Night time issues: So during the day I have a lot of sneezing and runny nose. I'm constantly blowing my nose. I notice out in public my nose will run more so than when I'm at home however at home it's runny as well. During the night. (I think this issue might have started by taking Zyrtec however since discontinuing taking it I'm still having the issue as described. However it was worse while taking Zyrtec) As soon as it starts getting late I can feel the left nostril begin to close. This is just sitting up regularly. As soon as I lay down for bedtime the left nostril will completely close off. Only the left each and every night. Sometimes during the night the right becomes clogged and the left opens but it always starts out with the left nostril. Because of this my sleeping is horrible. I am a nose breather all the way and because one nostril is completely blocked I'm constantly tossing and turning for relief. My usual method has been if the left is shut sleep on the right and if the right is shut sleep on the left...however this hasn't been helping recently. Also in the mornings I will have clear fluid in my ears, and my ears will itch really bad. I have to use cotton to soak up this fluid for relief but sometimes it drains all day long. So my thoughts are because of the blocked sinuses the excess mucus is draining into my ear canals. I'm sure I have allergies (maybe combined with something else too), however all of the over-the-counter allergy reliefs have been giving me side effects to where I cannot take them anymore. At this point the only thing I continue to do is the Saline nasal spray and Sudafed but I'm still suffering daily and nightly. Because of the lack of sleep and stress of my condition I've been feeling sadden and a little depressed. I've been experiencing ice pike headaches on the right side on and just above my temple which has me worried. I always think brain aneurysm. I have three children and I just want to be here for them happy and healthy without suffering anymore. If possible I'm looking for any and all advice. I do not mind purchasing inexpensive over-the-counter items if it will help, however I haven't had any luck with any so far. Thank you for reading 0 likes, 2 replies "

Neck Pain,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/shoulder-neck-chest-pain--687249,Shoulder/Neck/Chest Pain!,"Hi, Hope all is well. I've been doing some research myself. For the past 2 years from what I can remember, I've been having neck pain, shoulder pain, near the arm pit but on front chest and then radiates to front chest.. I get it daily which is crazy, I feel like a day doesn't go by if I haven't got the pain so I sort of got use to it. It becomes really annoying because it throws me off if something can seriously be wrong. I am not sure if it is Acid Reflux, but I am all over the place. I little about me! I'm 30, mostly in a computer chair at work, 5'6, about 240 lbs (Yes over weight) and slim to none exercise. I decided earlier this week, I will change my life and lose weight a long with getting active! I am on the start of that. So, obviously when losing weight and changing my diet comes the headaches and feeling off, so yes I am getting that now too, but this pain is so... unique. I just feel so tight like my muscles are tight or spasm. I sometimes notice my hand go numb here and there. I sometimes can wake up with my hand numb in sleep, as if I slept on it but didn't? Weird! About a year ago or better, I did an MRI, I was told I had 2 herniated disc. They wanted me to go to do physical therapy. I haven't had the chance to start yet, but plan to do that as well. They wanted me to start on Advil like 4 times a day for 3 weeks, but I can't due to my stomach. They also prescribed for the pain these 2: Methocarbamo 750MG OR CYCLOBENZAPRINE 5MG which I haven't tried yet. They are relaxers. Do they work? Back to the pain, I can feel off like when walking just not as I am going to trip or fall, just off balanced a bit. As I told this to you, I am sitting in my chair not straight up back pushed back a little, when I go to raise my back up and sit straight and push my chest forward to stretch, this is where I feel the pain in the shoulders/upper back/neck area. From there, my head feels a bit off, again not dizzy as the room is spinning, just 'dazed.' I'm not sure if this an anxiety symptom playing a game on me? But the pain is real. The shoulders or muscles seem to pull and create this chest pressure that has my head flying and thinking it is a heart related. My GP thinks it is all muscles.

Not sure what there is left for me to do. ,"I looked over another thread where the writer seems to have a similar problem to mine, but I thought it might help me more if I posted my own specific issues and history, especially because no one so far has given that person a solution that has fixed the problem. I never had trouble with neck pain throughout my life. But almost exactly 2 years ago, some friends of mine who were living here in Japan were moving away and had stuff to get rid of. They had this big desk and they said I could have it for free, and I thought, “Hey, I need a desk! I’ll take it.” Little did I realize how tall it actually was when sitting at it, and unfortunately, my chair at the time was in a permanently reclined position, and so when I would use my computer (and sometimes I can spend too much time at the computer at once), my arm would be stretched way forward and upward to use the mouse, and I didn’t realize how bad my posture had become and the repercussions it would have even to this day. Before I knew it, I started having a lot of trouble with neck pain. I started going to my local osteopath. And over these two years I have gone to him countless times, usually once a week until recently; I haven’t been going because I’m tired of him squeezing my neck with his hand. I tell them it hurts the sides of my neck when he squeezes, but he always seems to do it again the next time I come. He uses some massaging in addition to things like electrical pads, and while it seems like it helps some, it definitely hasn’t fixed the problem, obviously. I also went to an orthopedist, and all he did after giving me a quick check over was give me a handout with information about different stretches I can do. I’ve been doing most of those stretches every night to this day, and it helps, but it’s not enough. I’ve also occasionally gone for massages, but unless I have a lot of confidence that it is going to fix me I’m reluctant to go because I need to watch my money very carefully and massages are the most expensive option I’ve looked at so far. I’ve considered going for a CT scan to better assess the problem, but I’m hoping to avoid that if possible because I’m worried about additional costs (I do at health insurance but still). I’ve also considered trying acupuncture but I’m worried that all that’s going to do is temporarily help relieve some of the pain but not actually fix the problem. The other thing that I’ve thought about is exercising my neck, because it’s so sensitive I’m not sure which exercises would be safe to do. I’ve tried to do a little swimming, but I haven’t done enough to see if it’s been helping or not. It’s also hard to do anything consistently because I’m usually working, and to be honest, if I’m using much of what free time I do have to be doing exercises and other stuff, it’ll just make me frustrated because I already don’t have as much free time as I wish I did and there’s other stuff I want to and need to do. I’ve looked up my problem on the Internet to see if I could find additional good stretches and stuff for my neck, but so far nothing has worked. One person I know, who is a personal fitness trainer, noticed that my alignment is not good because when I let my arms hang at rest my palms face behind me, instead of toward my legs like they should. He gave me a sort of stretchy rubber tube that I could pull to try and fix that, but I found that before long it was only making my neck hurt. I’ve also tried using heat, but that hasn’t seemed to help me much. I’ve definitely noticed that looking down easily makes my neck hurt. Sometimes the small museum near me has special exhibits I like to go and see, and just spending an hour or two there looking down at the descriptions will make my neck sore for the rest of the day. And unfortunately, I love to use my cell phone a lot. When I’m not playing games I’m using the Internet or making notes or something. I know this isn’t helping me, but honestly, even if I reduced my cell phone usage, in my free time I would probably be replacing it with something else that would involve me looking down, like reading a book or something. I try to be careful not to tilt my head too much, but it really takes nothing at all to make my neck feel more aggravated. I also find that if I use my cell phone while I’m walking, even if I’m holding it up so my head is hardly looking down at all, it makes my neck feel more aggravated than if I’m using it while sitting. So obviously I need to be careful, but I don’t consider illuminating using my cell phone recreationally as an option because that’s part of how I relax (though I guess I should be more mindful of how much time I’m spending using it). I’m also wondering if I can help my situation with a better pillow, but I don’t really know what I need. Using a pillow when I’m lying on my back causes my neck to be pushed forward a little bit, so I just illuminate the pillow entirely in that case. I use one when I am on my stomach. It’s a firm pillow with beans inside instead of feathers. As for which parts of my neck bother me the most, it’s primarily my left side. Here’s a link to a doodle I made to try and express where the problems are. Sorry it’s so sloppy but I did this with my thumb on my phone screen. https://flic.kr/p/29A7RRp Basically, my sides are really stiff. If I turn my head to the right it hurts a lot more than when I turn it to the left. In fact, it feels a little relieving when I turn it to the left. I think this is somehow connected to me using my right arm so much when I hold my phone and do other stuff. The area I feel like is, for lack of a better way of putting it, the center of the pain, is just where the neck meets the skull on the left side. That’s the area where, when I get a massage, I always want the massage therapist to just press and hold for a long time in that one spot because it feels like a good, burning-type of relief sensation. But the problem runs through the muscles all the way down to where my shoulder and scapula are, and sometimes my left scapula muscles bother me as well. The right side is bad as well, but it’s the left I notice more when my neck is aggravated, for sure. Again, I think it’s connected to me using my right arm more. I notice that even when I’m sitting at church in the pew, because my neck has no support, my neck will get more aggravated by the end of service, even though my neck is aligned with my spine, upright. And if my neck is bothering me and I just tip my head all the way back and let it sit there, looking up at the ceiling, if I do this much at all, though at first it feels good on my muscles, it puts stress on my neck bone. Even putting it back for a short time, when I bring my neck upright again, I feel my bone pop in one place near the middle of the neck bone. So obviously stress has been put on the bones as well. And when I do my stretches, especially the one where I roll my head in a circular motion, I always can really hear a lot of loud crackling and sometimes popping. I do this stretch as well as looking up and down repetitively and tilting my head from side to side, though I don’t do that one much because it starts to make the sides of my neck hurt after doing it much. I also will connect my hands behind my back and pull my arms up and down. This one feels pretty good. Obviously my arms must be forward too much and so pulling the muscles back gives some relief. It just doesn’t seem fair because I used to have my arms forward using my computer, playing my 3DS, or using my phone as in the past as I do now, and it never bothered me. But that short time with the new desk combined with the chair giving me such bad posture really messed me up, and now everything bothers my neck. I know it’s important to mind my posture when I’m sitting in when I’m standing, and I know I probably should be reducing my time on my phone, but beyond that, I’m not really sure where to go from here. I feel like I’ve tried most of my options, and I would like some advice before I try to commit to something. I’m sorry this was such a long post but I really wanted to point out all the details and flesh it out. I really appreciate anyone who took the time to read this and anyone who has any advice to give!

Severe pain in the abdomen after eating. I thought it was nothing more than a case of indigestion. Over the course of three months, it would occur three more times. After two bowls of hot soup, the pain occurred again. The next day would be the onset of concerning symptoms. At the end of November, 2018 I would have constipation that would last for the next two months. Along with these symptoms would be waved of heat in my upper abdomen After drinking coffee. I would have colon spasms, and cases of Malabsorption that would occur in the middle of Janurary. While the indigestion has not occurred, nor has the heat sensations, I found that my stool came out more in balls, varying in the size of a pebble to almost as big as golf balls. I also had colon spasms that would occur. The most recent symptom has brought me to this board. Muscle spasms all across my body that started close to when I believed I suffered a case of Optic Nuritis. Pain when i moved my eyes too far to the left or right. The Twitching has been nonstop. If my colon has lost partial nerve function, then it seems likely that my limbs are following suit. I have no money to see a doctor.

Because I really do not know what to do! When I was young (between 22 and 26), I was distressed and abused tranquilizers, sleeping pills,  . I took up to 5 times the maximum recommended doses for 4 years. It took me a year and a half to detox. Since the age of 26, I no longer consume drugs or alcohol. But since that time, my muscles are tense and painful almost constantly. Doctors and neurologists say there is nothing to do. I followed two psychotherapies in case the cause was psychological. But that had no effect. (And I do not feel particularly anxious anyway) The treatments that help me the most are: supplementation of 2000 mg of lecithin a day, Acupuncture (once or twice a week), relaxation techniques, soft gymnastics, and especially warm bath accompanied by self-hypnosis the evening before going to bed. But these treatments do not cure me, they only reduce the pain and tension in my muscles. And that has hardly changed in 30 years. I am really tired of this constant pain. Have an idea of what I could or should do? Any idea will be really appreciated. Thank you very much in advance! 😃 0 likes, 3 replies "
Neurological Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/help-160-head-rushes-or-brain-zaps-everyday--611513,"Help - 160+ ""head rushes"" or ""brain zaps"" everyday? ","Hi Folks – I’m a 49 year old male and starting in May this year, I started experiencing some very weird “head rushes” or “head zaps” as I have seen other folks make reference to. I’m now 4 months in and they are continuing - getting worse and more frequent. I actually know exactly when I had the first one – I was on holidays and departing the hotel and I got this head rush that was very sharp and lasted only a few seconds. It felt like someone stuck a needle in my brain full of adrenaline. I could feel the rush come from behind my right eye and it was so strong I got tingling down my entire body. These “rushes” only last a few seconds and don’t interfere with my balance / motor skills nor do I have any cognitive break etc.… they are just very annoying and generate a bit of anxiety.  The rushes are not painful and no noise heard. After that first one, I was experiencing them 4 or 5 times every hour for the next month. For that first month, they generally only occurred when I was in situations that had a bit of anxiety involved – good or bad: i.e. playing a video game and monster jumps out, watching TV and phone rings… initially the sensation was almost pleasurable – almost like a release of sorts. Again, they only last a few seconds and once over, I do get an anxious feeling. Initially, in-between these episodes I felt fine. For the first month I just wrote these off as I must have picked up a bug while on vacation (I was in New York). Few items about me – I have never had any issues with depression or anxiety in the past and take no drugs and am a very moderate drinker.  I began to get worried the second month as the head rushes started to occur every 10 minutes of so regardless of what I was doing – no anxiety needed. These new head rushes are similar to the more anxiety generated rushes just a bit milder. They also last just a few seconds. In the second and third month of this issue, I got as many as 80 of the milder rushes a day. As of right now (four months in), I get the milder rushes up to 160 a day. I swear I can feel a build up to each rush in the minute before they occur. I still get the “sharper” and more anxiety driven rushes as well but 3 or 4 an hour. These rushes also occur at night and the sharper ones will wake me up. I’m off work at the moment and have very little stress in my life.  In addition to the head rushes, in month 3 and 4 I started experiencing general fatigue and am now sleeping 12 hour a day. I usually run on my treadmill for an hour and now can only manage 20 minutes before I am exhausted and drenched in sweat. One of the worse problems I am now having related to this is I have no sex drive – never had that issue before. I am also putting on weight.  After the first month I went to see my Doctor about this – he tested my thyroid and I was a bit low so am now on 50 mg of synthroid. My vitamin B was a bit low as well so am on a B supplement. As my symptoms are so strange and persistent, I had an MRI on my head done to ensure no tumor etc.… The MRI was clean. Doc also suspected Cushing Disease so have done 2 X 24 hour urine cortisol test. In both tests my cortisol was above average. Doc had MRI on my adrenal glands to see if there was a tumor – MRI was clean. Running out of ideas, my GP has now referred me to an Endocrinologist. The Endocrinologist had me do a blood cortisol test – it came up as abnormal but too low cortisol not too high? Endocrinologist now doesn’t think it is cushing or even endocrine issue?  I have searched high and low on the Net for folks with my similar symptoms – closest I can find are for folks with antidepressant withdrawal (SSRI) however, I have never been on antidepressants and am not on any drugs.  Anyways – saw this forum with folks who had similar symptoms and thought I would post in hopes of finding someone in a similar situation looking for answers.  1 like, 13 replies "

It all started in June last year i woke with a stiff neck and later that day did some neck stretches off of you tube. This pain seemed to ease in my neck but, seemed to travel from my left side neck to behind my left shoulder blade. Even though the   initially eased the muscle remained like a knot behind my left shoulder blade. i carried on for  couple of months but, my muscles in my neck became more tense and tight saw my GP who said health anxiety and tried to give me   and suggested yoga and  . Things got worse and more tight even effecting my scapula on the left side again like a tightness. Looking down and to either side hurt, and when i rotate my shoulder blades i hear and feel awful clunking and grinding noises but, this does not hurt. I tried yoga but , this made it worse so referred myself to health and wellbeing and attended 3 months of physio and had many back massages. In December i pulled my lower back started on many drugs to help which, also helped with my neck. As my neck seemed to be a bit better my physio discharged me. I had a month off of work due to my lower back I stopped the pain killers and my neck, shoulders and upper spine are just as bad. I have been back to my GP who have prescribed more pain killers. I am sick of this constant muscular neck pain, TBH the stretches seem to cause me more pain. I have started swimming and do mindfullness but no help. I tried the tennis ball roll on the wall but this is shear agony  on the area behind my left shoulder blade. I have now got pain in my middle back. Can anyone offer any help. I have had no scans or xrays but, the GP said it will not show any muscular  problem any way. Please shed some light x    2 likes, 27 replies "

Going on for 2+ years. ,"Right, so for over 2 years now, I've been having these bazaar sudden bouts of memory loss. They start with a dizzy feeling, followed by confusion and having no memory of what I was doing / where I was going / what day it is / what I HAVE been doing etc etc. I'm a 31 year old, otherwise healthy male. I've had multiple test done including:  , MRI x3 (all done WITHOUT contrast dye. More on that later...), EEG x2, 48 hour heart monitor and so far all have come back normal. The first MRI did show I had an 'arachnoid cyst' but apparently it's harmless. The second MRI was an fMRI which was fine, and the third MRI was to compare it to the first to see if the cyst had grown any bigger, which, thankfully, it hadn't. The attacks have recently changed, seemingly. At first, they would be quite long. Lasting anywhere between 5 and 20 minutes, and I could usually remember what I did DURING the attack. I still remember the first attack I had, looking through old phone messages remembering none of what I had read or sent. More recent attacks however are shorter, usually only a few minutes if that, and I can never remember what happened during. I make notes for work and sometimes I'll come back after having an attack and have no memory of writing the notes that are on the page. The attacks usually come in bursts. I'll be fine for a week or two and then I'll have them a few days in a row or even multiple times in a day. The longest I've gone between attacks is 4 weeks. I've been on epilepsy medication and anti-depressants (citalopram) but neither seemed to make a difference. So I guess my main questions are: Could this be  /  related? I have always been an anxious person (even more so since I've been having these attacks, due to fear of not knowing and being scared it might be serious) and I was going through a bout of depression at the time of my first attack Could the MRIs have missed something? As mentioned earlier, the MRIs were all done WITHOUT use of a contrast dye, which would make tumours etc show up more clearly. Could it be a sleep thing? I have had trouble sleeping in the past, although I've been sleeping better recently and the attacks keep coming.

On the other hand, there is information that sensory-motor impulses from the visceral organs travel along the splanchnic nerves. And there is a slight contradiction, because sensory-motor impulses usually go not in to to the sympathetic trunk, but to the dorsal ganglia. But the splanchic nerves connect just with the sympathetic trunk, and not with the dorsal ganglia. For example, in this study: sensory transmission pathways have been found to go to the spinal cord through the dorsal ganglia, which, to my knowledge, are not associated with splanchic nerves. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Hubby said: Thursday. Apparently I kept on repeating the same question every 5-10mins - about 20 times. Hubby thought that strange, why doesn't she know these simple things. Then Hubby asked me: do you know what we did this morning? And I couldn't tell him. He told me we had been shopping, so I said: well it can't be Thursday because I go shopping on a Friday! (No probs with LT memory/reasoning then?) Hubby was worried so he thought he'd better check what I'd been up to in the garden and found one long hazel branch cut off which he put in the wheelie bin, but I told him to cut it up in chunks as things mustn't stick out of the bin (bossiness still in tact!). He tidied the stuff up and I changed out of my wellies and garden clobber all by myself apparently (procedural memory intact!) and by then Hubby had Googled 'loss of memory', and it came up with things like: go straight to A&E, it could be blood clot. So at 4.30pm Hubby said we'll ring up the surgery and I said: I'll do that. So I rang the surgery myself and spoke to L, but she couldn't get much sense out of me apparently, so Hubby spoke with her and she advised him to take me to A&E. About 5pm arrived at the hospital. Hubby was chatting with me asking what we'd been up earlier that day, but I couldn't remember anything. Couldn't remember our walk, that I had done some invoicing and arranging parcel despatch. After 30mins it was my turn, then had   very quickly - around 6pm. apparently, had a Chest X-ray at 7.40pm and ECG at 8pm. I do remember a nurse sticking these ECG pads on my body, but I don't remember the actual ECG being recorded. The very first check had been how physically fit I was - knee reflex, push the medic's hand away with my own hand and foot, etc. - all OK. Followed by  . CT scan results came back within one hour, all clear. Good news, so then what could it be? Then it was change of shift (8pm-ish?) and at that stage they seemed to think I had to stay in overnight - I do remember that bit, being told to stay overnight, feeling quite calm and resigned. Then Dr D came to us towards the end of our stay - he tested my ST memory by asking me if I remembered his name. I had no trouble remembering his name. He told us I had Transient Global Amnesia. He said it was fairly typical, liable to have a  , it should have cleared up within 12 hours, with a 6% chance of recurrence. Otherwise I should be back to normal. But I have been feeling very groggy ever since, a headache for 2 whole days (yesterday Sunday, was the first day without) and very very tired, so it ws very reassuring to hear other people's experiences with similar after effects (on a soon to be defunct website). The consultant's secretary rang the next day with a follow-up appointment in 14 days' time. Can't fault the UK National Health Service. I have looked on YouTube for TGA and found a video called 'It's Tuesday' - a daughter recorded her mum in hospital - had to laugh, recognised all the symptoms, only with her it happened on a Tuesday, so daughter had to keep on repeating 'It's Tuesday' to her mum, hence the title of the video.  Hope it doesn't recurr.  Will ask consultant at my follow-up appointment if I need to avoid strenuous exercise for a while/forever? 0 likes, 57 replies "

Currently I am suffering with generalized body wide muscle twitching. They initially started in December of this year after I had a twitch in my right shoulder. I decided to google the symptoms and ended up in the worst panic of my life. I thought at first it could be MS and I then learned of ALS and my twitches exploded all over. I went to a neurologist in March who did not want to do the EMG and she said it was something called benign fasciculation syndrome. It took some time but the twitches became less frequent but never went away. In July I had a full physical and my GP stated it was nothing and could be attributed to stress or somatization of symptoms. I began an accelerated nursing program and now I can't concentrate because I am scared to death again because the twitching has come back.  My biggest problem is the unbelievable amount of discrepancy there is related to the subject. You can look on any site and it states that ""muscle twitching"" is a sign of MND. There are people who have been diagnosed who say they started out with twitching as their first symptoms. There are people in their 20s saying they have been diagnosed with the illness. Then there are hoards of people who state twitching is related to   and stress. That it is benign if no other symptoms are present. I just do not know what to think. I am 27 and have never been diagnosed with GAD or anything but I have had a very stressful childhood. Maybe I do need to see a psychiatrist?  If anyone has these issues please let me know. I would love to discuss them I hate this so much 4 likes, 39 replies "

I was diagnosed with epilepsy 12 years or so ago because of 2 grand mals within a year. I am on lamotrigine and have only possible auras every couple months since then. My neurologist looks at me like I'm crazy when I tell him the tickle neck problem and smiles a little condescendingly saying he does not think think it is related at all to my seizures. Besides, I have had these as long as I can remember, way before the grand mals.   Is there a name for this condition? Why does no one seem to have this same problem? It is so debilitating and draining the nights I have it, that it often brings me to tears. Any way to cure it? 😓 Thank you! Leslie Ann 2 likes, 26 replies "

Medication is after a lot of testing out years ago Tramadol (slow realessed over 12 hours ) and Gabapentin which is fantastic, I have had a back operation in the UK and 2 spinal stimulators fitted in Germany but both didn't work (I am that unlucky 20 percent 🙄 ), now I am taking Marinol ( also called Dronabinol a Medical  ) and comes with all the side effects without the smoking etc, oh and only occasionally giggling, but I can't stand this stoned feeling all day everyday maybe its being 56 years old 🤟😎. lastly I have investigated and bought a small bottle of   drops from the online chemist I use frequently as they source everything from here in Germany,   is legal everywhere with no prescription and comes with no or very little THC so feeling stoned etc is a thing off the passed, the   actually work a treat but cost 50 euros a bottle and to be used when needed ,I think I will need 3 maybe more bottles a month, I am not well off at all for money but to have little pain and very few or no side effects is priceless. Nights are the worse now with the   as when I wake with pain around 2am I must get up go downstairs to the fridge warm the bottle a little (as it thickens when cold) 2 drops under the tongue and job done, but as sufferers with nerve problems will tell you, when your in bed in severe pain as it's in your head as well, you need medication but can't get up to get it, it's the worsed feeling I know and can understand those  who get seriously depressed (I have once), I try my hardest everyday to laugh or cry it really doesn't  matter as long as it's out ( talk talk talk ), I am man on an on going quest to be comfortable just comfortable but most of all Tramadol free, it's not a lot to ask, is it.

Neuropathic Pain,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/ulnar-nerve-compression-690342,Ulnar Nerve Compression,"Hello - I appear to be experiencing some Ulnar Nerve compression in my left arm. Here is some background on what led up to this. I am a 33 year old Male, about a week and a half ago I was working on cutting deer meat when I cut up near the left tip of my middle finger (of the left hand) with a knife. I cleaned up the cut, applied isopropyl alcohol and Neosporin to the cut and put a bandaid on it. At the time I had no numbness or odd sensations in my hand. About 3-4 days after I took the bandage off and was noticing that I appeared to have some numbness in my hand, along with some pressure around the palm of my hand. I then started experiencing some warmthness in this hand, extending partially up my arm. When this started occuring I went to a Walk In clinic who looked at the cut and my hand and other than the cut didnt see anything abnormal. They prescribed me a 10 day supply of Amoxicillin for an antibiotic (in case there eas an infection from the cut) along with a 5 day supply of Prednisone, along with a Tetnis shot. I am not on my last day of the Prednisone course and I feel like I have much better sensation in my left hand and that my numbess is gone, however I've had compression in my Ulnar nerve for the past few days. The compression appears to be centered mostly near my elbow, either on the inner side of the Funny bone, or just above it in my upper arm. It feels like in that one spot like the never is being pinched. I have no idea if the cut to my finger in any way could have caused this, or if it's pure coincidence. I will say that I have never experienced anything similar to this before. From what I understand the Ulnar nerve covers your pinky finger and right side of the ring finger, whereas my cut was to my middle finger so I dont know how the cut to the middle finger would affect the Ulnar nerve. Is it possible that I have some inflammation from the cut that is somehow affecting this nerve? Would you expect to see this compression if you did have an infection I'm trying not to worry too much but at the same time I don't want to ignore the problem. Would a hand Surgeon be a good option to make an appointment with if this doesn't resolve over the next fee days or what would you recommend doing? Thank you very much for your feedback! 1/4/19 UPDATE: Just an update, the compression I felt in my elbow is gone, however I am feeling compression now above the elbow, on the upper part of my arm, and at times right below my shoulder. I want this to go away! What can I do? I had an appointment with an NP in Hand Orthopedics and she has scheduled me to have an EMG test performed. I wonder if there is some type of fluid buildup from inflammation from my cut (even though its not the same nerve). 0 likes, 3 replies "

But I'm at a music festival this weekend and I wondered if I would be silly to drink a pint of cider, maybe two. I wouldn't get excessively drunk as I have a 5 year old but a pint might be nice.  Would that be really silly? What would you do? I did ask the nurse and she said it would probably be okay but then I read that it might lessen the efficacy of the pills. So I would like to know if anyone has ever had a bullseye rash for any other reason, especially such a quickly disappearing one ! 0 likes, 0 replies "

The last couple of months have been hard for me and I just want to start feeling better. I'm begging any of you to take a look at the below and let me know of any insight that you can possibly provide on the matter.  Over the last four months, I have been experiencing a wide range of strange and disturbing symptoms. I have not found any answers from a traditional healthcare standpoint and decided to reach out to you to see if you've heard of anything like this. Below, I will outline the symptoms that I have been experiencing along with the tests that I have done from a traditional healthcare standpoint. Again, ANY help that you can provide on this would be greatly appreciated. I have a young daughter at home and really need to start getting better.    Symptoms:  Frequent Heartburn - I've never struggled with heartburn before this. This causes a burning in my chest and tightness in my throat.  Chest Pains  Muscle Twitching - Body-Wide... This comes and goes and can be felt anywhere, especially in my legs.  Muscle Coordination/Off-Balance - I feel like my hands are not coordinated and that my balance is off, though when I test my balance, etc... I seem to be fine.  Muscle Soreness - This comes and goes and is not brought on by a specific activity.  Heavy Anxiety/Doom Feelings - These seem to not really be brought on by anything in specific.  Random Skin Rashes/Tingling Mouth - I do not have any allergies that I am aware of and this is a newer symptom.  Frequent Belching and Gas  Urinary Slowness and Frequent  Vision Floaters  Heavy fatigue after eating  Mouth Sores/Blisters  Hypersensitive Nerves - Water drops are very noticeable, etc.  Fine Motor Functions Appear to be fine  Traditional Healthcare Checks:  Heart Echo and Stress Test - Clear  Endoscopy and Celic/HPylori Screen - Clear  Neuro Exams x2 - Clear and no muscle weakness Lyme Disease and Western Blot - Clear -  s  Rhumotoidologist Exam - Clear  Endocrinologist - Ordered 7-Day Glucose Monitor and Testosterone Check.  Diabetes Blood Tests - Clear  Chest X-Ray - Clear  EKG - Clear  ANA Test - Mild Positive  Blood Sugar and C-Pep Tests - Mildly Off - Investigating Further  CBC Tests - Clear  Brain MRI - Clear  Spine MRI - Clear  Brain CT Scan - Clear  EEG - Clear  Lupus Blood Test - Negative  Inflammation Rate Blood Tests - Negative  STD Tests - Negative  Heavy Metals Blood Test - Negative  Vitamin Blood Tests - Negative  Parasite Stool Test - Negative  Vitamin Tests - All Fine - Except Low D Kidney and Liver Blood Tests - Clear  Celiac Blood Test - Positive but then Endoscopy Negative for it.  I've basically learned to live with these symptoms at this point but I feel like things are getting worse. I keep getting told that I am find but I know that I am not. I find myself missing things sometimes when trying to grab something/missing keyboard keys, getting random rashes, etc. The most disturbing is the muscle twitching that can occur anywhere on my body.  I am getting nowhere with traditional medicine at this point and I feel that doctors are scratching their heads. I've done so many tests so it is hard to argue with them but I also know that the symptoms are still present and persistent. Really the only thing that we have to go on is a positive ANA test but the Rhumologist says that I am fine.  My diet and exercise patterns have always been excellent and I do not take any medication.  I'm really very troubled by everything and am desperate at this point.  I would really appreciate any information that someone can provide on my issues.  Thank You,    0 likes, 25 replies "

It started with a feeling of a lump in my throat that would not go away, and frequent hiccups. I am now on a medication for reflux. I realize that is not a known symptom of Lyme, but I wanted to include it because it all started around the same time. I also had ear pain that lasted for weeks, with no sign of infection. I then started experiencing muscle aches in my legs. For a solid two weeks, they hurt. Sometimes  they also felt very heavy- like there was cement strapped to them. Then the muscle aches spread through my body- arms, neck, shoulders, back.This pain usually moves around- but occasionally several things hurt at once. I also had frequent tingling in my hands and arms- one day, my entire left arm tingled all day. Then I started to have fleeting nerve pains all over my body- especially in my wrists, chest, and ankles, but even in my teeth. Anyway, at an appointment in late August I had a blood test for Lyme. It came back negative. My doctor put me on doxycycline anyway because of my symptoms. I started to feel somewhat better- notably, the heaviness and intense pain in my legs disappeared. The tingly feelings lessened- but the symptoms didn't fully go away. Because there was improvement, my doctor extended the antibiotic for 7 days. I finished the full course about a week ago. Overall, there is significant improvement. My ears rarely hurt. If my legs hurt, it's much more mild. The nerve pain is far less frequent, as are the tingly/numb feelings. However, the muscle aches have not fully gone away. I still wake up stiff  and with something (or more than one thing) sore. It usually gets a bit better throughout the day, but I still feel like I'm hurting more than is normal. The hiccups/throat lump feeling are also still present, though I know that is quite possibly a second and unrelated issue. If you read this far, I really appreciate it! I would just like to hear if anyone has had a similar experience or has any thoughts on whether this could be Lyme. Has anyone had symptoms linger after a full course of treatment? Also, I never had a rash or  . I know those are typical symptoms. I did have a known tick bite, but it was 2 months before any symptoms started.

It can make you a carrier and because of this many expensive horses who have survived the initial illness are eventually culled.

They were skin-colored at first and itchy and then turned into what you see in the pictures and stopped  . The rash/reaction went away that night and only the bite marks remained. Since it was the first time I got a reaction that bad I googled it and all I could see was Lyme. I tried to ignore it and also had no symptoms but now a week ago I started having joint and muscle pain, which is either from   or it means that this was in fact a lyme tick. Can you please give me your opinion before I go to an LLMD? Thank you. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Lyme Disease,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/help-685829,Help,"HELLO, So I was bit by a tick back in 2006. i did develop a rash that eventually scarred. I didnt know anything about how bad ticks could be until recently though. Shortly after, I got bit I did get quite sick and was in severe pain. Was pretty much bedrriden. I went to sports medicine and was diagnosed with fibromalgia.  For the next 12 years, I have been in alot of pain. I have found that my short term memory is gone and I very recently started having tingling in my fingers abs feet. My father recently mentioned LYME DISEASE to me and wow I have almost all of the sypmtoms. However, when my LYMES test came back it was negative except for the IGG 41 ab. present. I read that having lymes for a long time it will eventually move ro your tissue and bone so it will not be found in the blood any longer. Is this true? I know you cant believe what you read on the internet but it would make so much sense because I am having alot of random pain in my joints. My pcp just said she was going to continue with muscle relaxers ext. but I really want to know wth is in my body. So basically, is it possible to test negative for lymes after 12 years and should I try to find a LLMD or a disease doctor. Or is being IGg 41 ab nothing to worry about? I have been sick for so long at this point, I just want to feel better. 0 likes, 4 replies "

Lyme Disease,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/suspected-chronic-lyme-morgellons-690137,Suspected Chronic Lyme & Morgellons,"Hi! I had bad bites 9 years ago in May 2010. They came up a week after returning from holiday in Thailand, but I'm also very outdoorsy so could have been from home in UK. They went bad and after a week of oral antibiotics from GP (who said they were boils!), they got a lot worse and I got even more poorly, raging fever, throwing up. I went to hospital and they said I had developed sepsis. I had a week of IV antibiotics in hospital followed by another 2 weeks oral antibiotics at home. So in total 4 weeks of antibiotics. There were 5 bites in total, all on one leg, the biggest one that took over the whole side of my thigh looks like it could of had the bullseye rash, hard to tell as I was very tanned. Hospital doctor could not diagnose but said likely they were some sort of tick bites as they had a black dot in the middle. A few months after treatment, the bites had all healed but the infection came back in my leg again with fever etc and I had another course of antibiotics. My health hasn't been right since. A few years ago i requested a test for Lyme but was refused, GP said if i had contracted Lyme, the month of antibiotics would have killed it. He also said the Lyme test wasn't accurate so there wasn't much point. Symptoms since bites: Spells of nausea, not being able to eat, no appetite, diarrea, IBS, along with weight loss Spells of chronic fatigue (sometime debilitating) Low blood pressure episodes Low blood sugar issues Temperature regulation issues (sometimes go hyperthermic, sometimes mild fever) Awful hormonal issues, severe PMT, bleeding 20 days a month Frequent injuries, sprains etc Very frequent infections. Colds & sick bugs every few months and also had Pneumonia and been hospitalized for a Quinzy needing IV antibiotics Developed skeeter syndrome (mosquito bite allergy) where whenever I get a bite my whole limb swells up and often needs antibiotics Heart palpitations & confirmed arythmia (of unknown cause) Post nasal drip / GERD / sticky thick lump in throat Insomnia Breathlessness Mild swelling of airways no known cause Recurrent fungal infections Melasma Ringing ears Various tests over the years have shown I'm in perfect health, except for one showing calcium deficiency which was resolved with treatment, and another showing high liver enzymes, which there was no cause for, but resolved itself. Basically I'm just told I'm fit, well and healthy and I must just be under too much stress. Anyhow, playing with my sons new TV microscope today that he got for Xmas, and I've accidently found that I am covered in what looks like Morgellons? All over my body but mostly face, neck, chest, back, upper arms, feet & hands. They cant be seen at all with the naked eye, these pics are at something like x200 magnification I think. Some are very close to the surface and some further under. And looking into this, Morgellons is apparently closely linked to chronic Lyme. Apparently the CDC said 60% of people with Morgellons tested positive for tick-bourne illness. Worryingly, my 7 year old son is also covered in these Morgellons things. He gets sick a lot and random fevers and always complaining of sore legs, or sore tummy, or headache. But I always assumed it was just nursery or school germs going about. Now I'm concerned if I did contract Lyme and it wasn't treated properly, I may have passed it to him during pregnancy. He was conceived less than a year after I was hospitalized for the bites. I'd really like to know if I have Lyme or not and therefore if my son may have, I guess I'm just looking for some input really, what to do. My GP has finally agreed over the phone to test us both for Lyme, so that's good, but my understanding is it might show as negative even if we have it? I will try to get a GP appointment for the suspected Morgellons next week. I have attached photos of the bites from 9 years ago and a few pics of the Morgellons in our skin.

Lupus,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/should-i-get-tested--685014,Should I get tested? ,"About 6 months ago I started getting some odd symptoms. It started with a burning sensation in my mouth and lips, eventually it evolved into hives/rash on my face, but mostly on the right side. I went to an urgent care office and they prescribed prednisone and told me to follow up with my doctor. The prednisone did the trick and I went to my doctor a few weeks later. His suspicion was a food allergy, as was mine. He referred me to an allergist. I couldn't get an appointment right away so decided to wait a few weeks and call back when my after summer as they advised me I would have to be off Claritin for 7 days prior to any testing. By the time fall comes my seasonal allergies are minimal so I could discontinue the Claritin with minimal issues. About the time its finally getting cold enough to discontinue the Claritin the burning, itchy, rash comes back on my face, although on the left side mostly this time.  I decided to cut my diet down to a few foods to see if that helps. It doesn't. Meanwhile I call the allergist back and they can't fit me in until December. I make the appointment but explain that I'm pretty miserable so they advise me to go back to the urgent care and get another round of prednisone. I went this morning and got the prednisone, but in the exam the practitioner said the other thing that came to his mind was Lupus.

I have had massive pains in my left ear for 3 years. My neurologist who is at his wits end thought a lumbar puncture may relieve what could be a potentially low pressure headache. After the operation i felt fine but the next day i started getting right ear pain. As you can imagine panic slowly set in. For some reason the day after this it completely disappeared. Unfortunately the next day it hit me hard. Its been 4 weeks since the lumbar puncture and the pain is severe. It seems any pressure on my right ear such as bending my neck etc causes severe pain. In addition it gets very painful listening to any noise and i have to turn down the TV etc. My neurologist has tried to tell me it is nothing to do with the lumbar puncture..... It started the day after and i cant believe that i can have chronic pain in both my ears from now on. He is arranging a blood patch to be done but unfortunately every time i go into hospital i get sent home (NHS.......). He is very doubtful it will work as he is sure the two aren’t linked. I just think this is a crazy diagnosis. It doesn’t take a genius to work out that it happened the day after!! I should make it clear that the pain is significantly different. My left ear feels like it has a knife stuck in it for the last 3 years. My right ear after the lumbar feels like a combination of an ear infection and massive pressure on it. However my ears don't get blocked. When i do clear them the right one feels week and that it may burst. Any advice would be appreciated, i am bed ridden and while i was struggling with my left ear, i am now completely crippled and spend all day in bed for my own good.

I stood for 30 minutes today and I wasn’t able to trigger one but I feel like if I stayed standing for another 10 minutes then I would have gotten a headache. My question is, is this blood patch something that is supposed to help decrease the headaches over time(like a few days)? Or should I be headache free by now? Any help or advice would be appreciated. Thanks! 0 likes, 5 replies "

May 1st I was admitted to hospital. 3rd May I had an LP which confirmed meningitis. I was given IV caffeine lots of fluids antibiotics and antivirals (which was given on arrival due to symptoms) but the pain wasn’t going so may 12th they done another LP. 3 attempts whilst I was on my bed and 6 attempts in a theatre room with the anaesthetists and she hit 2 nerves making my leg jolt. Traumatic!!! More IV caffeine and the low pressure slightly eased. The dressing was changed twice because of blood and fluid my back was wet. I have been home for 48 hours now. I have severe stiffness in my back and a don’t half way up my spine then further up a squish lump. The actually LP area doesn’t hurt at all in my lower back it’s middle and shooting up into my shoulders. There’s times I feel paralysed like I cannot move because if I move I get intense pain and pressure on my back. There’s no bruising but I’m having sweats hot and cold sweats. I need to pee a lot and when I eventually sit up I still have low pressure headache. I am trying my best to keep moving so I don’t seize up but every hour I am getting worse. One doctor said a hematoma (without seeing me face to face) another said this is what happens...I’ve had 8 LPs in my life and nothing at all like this. I’m 26! Is this normal? Does I have so much pressure against my spine? I can’t lie on my back, I can’t straighten my back much but I cannot bend what so ever and movement is becoming agonising? I’ve tried over the counter pain meds and also a dose of tramadol and oramorph (not taking too much because of rebound headaches and this low pressure headache I don’t want to make worse... and yes I have tried heat packs and cool packs) it hurts back. 3.08am and I’m sobbing with discomfort.

I have done so much searching and reading on the Internet to know it is normal however want to question the advice my doctor gave me yesterday. Firstly, there was little advice really In terms of managing it. Following what I have read online I am trying to drink as MUCH water as I can. Not that it is helping. Also going to get some Dioralyte today to see if that helps with hydrating. Open to all suggestions though, if anybody has any. I am not taking any paracetamol/pain killers as they weren’t helping and doctor said if the don’t help to stop as they could make the headaches worse.. Now what I am questioning is my doctors advice that I need to give it 2 weeks before going back for a potential blood patch. For anyone else in the UK is this normal practice? Everybody online seems to have had the blood patches within a few days.  I really would of course like nothing more than to avoid another needle in my spine, but feel like if it’s not going to get better on it’s own then this is the only choice. I’m struggling on day 4 of lying down and really worry for my mental well being if I get to two weeks. thank you for your time. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Lymphadenopathy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/swollen-lymph-nodes-676588,Swollen lymph nodes,"My story... I was at work one afternoon a month ago & noticed a lump on my neck - I went to the doctors the following day and had an ultrasound & a full blood count. The ultrasound showed a few swollen lymph nodes in my neck. That night I went to the gym and another lump popped up.  I went to see an ENT for a follow up and he said it was the start of a throat infection and gave me antibiotics. The antibiotics did nothing and over the course of that week my symptoms got worse. One tonsil was very swollen, the other coated in white. I was having night sweats, had an on/off mild fever & I was having upper left abdominal pain & generally felt awful. My throat was never sore. I also had some heart palpitations, dizzy spells and my chest generally felt uncomfortable. I also was experiencing chronic fatigue.  I went back to the ENT and requested a EBV Test. This came back positive and I was sent to see an infectious diseases doctor. He went through my symptoms, felt my spleen and said it was enlarged. He agreed on the Mono diagnosis. I had a chest X-ray which came back clear and 3 days later a ultrasound on my abdomon which by that point the spleen pain had gone and all results came back normal.  I had a liver function test which was very high and my bloods were retested and monocytes and lymphocytes were both very high.  My whole body ached.  After nearly 2 weeks of very healthy eating and at home relaxing, my symptoms gradually decreased.  During this period I was very worried about lymphoma and Lukeimia - I went to see a number of doctors who all agreed on the mono diagnosis.  My bloods were re tested and the liver function returned to normal after about 3 weeks and my lymphocytes are still slightly high at 51%. I have been given iron tablets for 6 months as my iron levels were slightly Low. My blood was looked at and the hemotoglisgt said there are reactive lymphocyte cells. Apart from that the blood looks normal.  I am still incredibly anxious as 4 weeks on my lymph nodes are still enlarged. After a further ultrasound there are a number of lumps in my neck & a couple under my arms & small ones in my groin.  My chest is also still feeling uncomfortable & the fatigue is lingering, but not as bad as it was two weeks ago.  I went to see a surgeon who said he would remove & test one of the lymph nodes to rule any bad things out, but I am extreamly nervous as this will involve general anesthetic.  Does anyone relate to my symptoms?

I was admitted to the hospital for extreme fatigue,  , and headaches. I was diagnosed with migraines and the lumbar puncture was just one of the many tests that they ran. The procedure itself took about 10 to 15 minutes and was very painful, however unlike a lot of the stories on here the doctor didn't miss or have to stick me several times in order to get my spinal fluid. They had me laying down flat on my stomach and used an x-ray to find where where he was going. After the procedure the tech. that helped the doctor told me to move myself to the other bed so that I could be transferred to my room as I was being admitted for further testing. The doctor told me to lay down on my back and be completely still for four hours which I did. I only sat up in my bed after the 4 hours were up however about 3 hours after I did sit up, I was in extreme pain in my back. I never had a   after the spinal tap apart from the Migraines that they diagnosed me with but it did not result from the spinal tap. It has now been 2 months since this has happened and I have still not been back to work because I cannot bend over at all. My pain is from the puncture site in my lower back and shoots up my spine to up upper back and neck. It also will shoot down my right leg from time to time. Sitting is the absolute worst for me it, I can stand for a little while before it starts to hurt me really bad. A week after I had the spinal tap, I went to a pain clinic and had a MRI done to make sure that my spine is not leaking and its not. I am now in physical therapy twice a week and it does help but only while I am there. My doctors and my PT have never seen anything like this.

Lumbar Puncture,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/post-lumbar-puncture-pain-622476,Post Lumbar puncture pain,"Hello community. So I received a lumbar puncture almost 2 years ago and I still have pain around my spine in the precise area where the needle pierced me. The pain has been there continuously ever since the procedure. It feels like a dull tinge right on my spine, always limiting my movement and flexibility. Depending on my movement it can become a sharper tinge and pain. It feels like there is a little cyst that can hardly be felt but I'm pretty sure its there.  Admittedly, I have done little yet to try and solve this issue. I spoke to a couple doctors from the  same medical establishment, but they just shrugged their shoulders. The pain is less if I am warmed up, loose and in warm temperatures. Also I did have a blood patch 3 days after the puncture. I had severe headaches for a week after but they went away for good after that. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. 0 likes, 2 replies "

The ones in my neck are very small as I said, less than 1cm and very soft. The one larger one on the left side of my groin is the most concerning. It’s fairly soft and moveable but seems to fluctuate in size, going down to 1cm at times and back up to 1.5cm/2cm others. I had blood work done which came back normal, but my doctor is sending me to a surgeon, I’m assuming for a biopsy of the groin node.

Let me list a brief medical history and medications below: 27 y/o Female, Type 1 Diabetic (for 20 years) very well controlled, am currently on Humalog insulin (pump) and 20mg Citalopram (for 6 years). I take Vit D, Vit B12 and Iron supplements. I work full time in an office but walk 6000-12000 steps a day. For the past 2-3 months I have had an array of symptoms that appear to be getting worse. At first, I started experiencing itchy tops of both of my feet, no rash in sight however. I have no history of neuropathy and have had this looked at during this time. The itchiness now happens on my feet, hands arms, shoulder neck and mostly my chest, top and bottom of my clavicles. I am experiencing extreme exhaustion but sleep 8-9hours most nights. I have aches in my arms and my shoulders most days also. My lymph nodes are swollen, and the left side of my neck has a weird ache that I can’t quite describe. I have been getting spells of vertigo and dizziness also. I have been to the doctors 4 times now, the first time I was told it was the gym causing my symptoms and was given some stretches to do. This hasn’t and isn’t working and I feel I can no longer go to the gym (haven’t been in 3 weeks) as I am just so tired. The 2nd time I was given Fexofenadine 180mg, taken once daily. This didn’t help any of my symptoms and my itchiness continues to get worse with no rash. The 3rd time I was given another antihistamine Montelukast 10mg, taken once daily along with the Fexofenadine given to me in visit 2. I was sent for a full blood work also. The 4th time I was told of my results, all was fine and normal with nothing I quote ‘Sinister’ showing. I was advised that my iron was still low, but not to an anaemic level, and that I should double my dose of iron supplements that I take daily. I was also given an antifungal cream. The doctor suggested I might have a fungal skin infection though there is nothing visually on my skin, his only reason was that “diabetics are prone to fungal skin infections”. The cream has yet to make any difference and I am still taking the two antihistamines to no avail. I just don’t know what to do anymore, I feel like I am getting worse. I am so tired and agitated because my chest and neck and arms are just getting itchier. My arms ache more often than not. I am exhausted and mentally foggy. Are you able to advise me what to do next?

Later that day I was diagnosed with pharyngitis and viral meningitis. I had a lumbar puncture done 6 times which caused further symptoms.  I’m now back in the uk and resting.  I had a lump on the left side of my neck ever since November 2017. This lump has not gone away. I also feel a little feverish but maybe I’m still recovering from what I suffered?  I went to see my gp and he examined me. He felt the lump on my neck that’s been there for almost 5 months. He also discovered another lump on my groin (which I can’t seem to find).  He seemed calm but told me I need an urgent referral to a haematologist as he thinks it could be lymphoma. But he said don’t read into it. But I read into it and I don’t really know what to expect. What is going to happen when I see the haematologist? Do my symptoms really suggest I have my lymphoma? Or could it just be due to the meningitis  I had 2 weeks ago? I went to see a GP again. I had an appointment with the manager of the practice. He knew what it was about as he knows I had been urgently referred for an appointment with the haematologist.  I have been experiencing a sharp pain in the left upper quadrant of my abdomen below my left rib. I explained it to him and he palpated it and explained how the other GP who referred me wrote on the notes that he could feel my spleen.  I explained how nervous I was about the scan and about the possibility of having cancer. I asked him to recheck the lump on my neck too. He said no matter how much he feels the lump and examines me he won’t know. Only the scan will tell me. I asked if I will be taken seriously by the haematologist and he said they have to as it was an urgent referral.  So could it be lymphoma? What will happen with the haematologist? What kind of symptoms did anyone suffer? Thank you for your time Hassan  0 likes, 4 replies "

I showed my mom and she said it was nothing to worry about probably a cyst and said she'll call the doctor but never did. Last year while I was stressing out about possibly having   (I don't have breast cancer though, I was going through hormones and thought I had breast cancer at 12   ) and I somehow remembered the bump again it and checked on it. I'm not even sure if it got bigger from the first time I noticed it bc I could barely remember, but I do remember stressing out so much about it when I remembered it was there last year. My mom and I went to the doctor and he wasn't worried, said it was some gluten problem (he told me he had the same thing) and I went back home. But it didn't feel right bc I searched online and no one else had the problem. I mean if we both had the problem then shouldn't I at least find someone else with the same problem? So I asked my mom again and for some reason we decided to go to the same doctor a couple months later and he gave me a totally different diagnosis! I even forgot what he said, but he totally forgot I had visited him a couple months ago and ignored me when I said it's been there for (probably) two years. My mother doesnt think anything is wrong with it, refuses to at least research my problem and gets angry when I talk to her about it bc she claims I bring it up too much. I asked my dad to take me but he keeps pushing it away and says he'll find another doctor another time and he'll talk to me another time about it and we never get to talk about it. My parents are kind of struggling with money right now so I guess finding another doctor and all wouldn't help but they should at least be worried!! And my symptoms are I have two lymph nodes in the back of my head. The right side is smaller than the left and actually the one on my left really scares me because there's like some dent in the middle of it but it's still connected and I think they might be matted lymph nodes !!!! i really don't know and I'm so scared and I've been crying and freaking out and worrying but my parents aren't listening to me!!!!! Both are hard, the right is a little bit movable while the left barely moves if I push on it!! There is also one in my armpit that I noticed last year, small, movable and soft, I don't think it has grown either so I don't worry about that one as much as the one in the back of my head. I don't think i have anymore lymph nodes. None of the other symptoms ( ,  , weight loss etc.).  And I had this lice infestation (ikr it's gross) so maybe that caused it. But the left node in the back of my head scares me to death and no one is listening to me  . I don't want to ask my mom anymore bc she will get mad and what's the point of asking my dad since he's going to push it aside.  And if I had to guess how long the one in the back of my head has been there for I'd say 2-3 years, though I'm not sure. I mean wouldn't I at least have some troubling symptoms if it's been there for three years?

(stuffy nose and boogers, occassional bloody nose if i blow too hard... i live in the mountains where its dry.... i just assumed this was the culprit) i will definitely update everyone once i get the results of the CT, but i   Remind you: ive had them like this for YEARS 10+ years. 3.8cm cervical lymph node, painless, moveable, i cant tell the consistency of it, i dont know if its rubbery or not. when i push on it, it moves around. 0 likes, 7 replies "

Lymphadenopathy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/one-sore-lymph-node-692131,One sore lymph node,"hi, So  I'm  sixteen years old and quite anxious at the moment. Basically, I have a sore lymph node on the left side of my neck which hurts when i press it. I'm really scared because the internet says its most likely an infection causing it but i dont feel like i have any sort of virus, maybe a slight cold at a push. I feel like its hurt for quite a bit (noticed it a few months ago) when i press it but idk what is causing it and whether i should be scared of cancers that could cause it. For as long as i can remember to be honest ive also had a pain in both armpits when i press them in certain areas but i didnt think anything of it until now because ive had that for years. Id really appreciate it if anyone could give me some advice about what to do, thank you 0 likes, 9 replies "

Saw my ent who put the camera down my nose and said it all was good. Well this was right at the beginning of May. I developed what felt like several swollen lymph to me. One behind my ear which feels kind of hard and others directly down under my jaw that are big soft and very mobile. They do not hurt. I have been to my doctor so many times over this. I've been to the emergency room. Ive saw different doctors. I even went back to my ent and he said he felt a little one but no cause for concern. I asked for an.ultrasound he said if it makes me feel better. They said it came back normal. They always say there's nothing there. My primary doctor said that until about a month ago she FINALLY felt what I'm talking about. So she ordered a CT of my neck. Which she says she believes the lymph nodes are acting up due to my tonsils. She has said all along how big my tonsils are and my throats red. But none of it hurts.the ct revealed two enlarged nodes on the right side where I'm always complaining and one on the right side. They were all around 2 ish cms. The radiologist even commented on how big my tonsils were and he suggested they're reactive nodes rather than cancerous. Which is what I've been so worried about all these months. I am always tired but I also have something called SIBO (small intestinal  ) this started around the same time as the nodes in my neck. It'd s bacterial over growth in the small intestine. I have abnormal stools, gas, etc. Its hard to treat I'm on my 2nd round of   for it and no improvements I know I have it though. I tested positive for it. So I'm feeling with that also. I have taken antibiotics which have done nothing for me for my stomach issues or the lymph nodes. I was referred to a different ent for the end of this month. She said if he doesn't think its my tonsils then she would send me for a   only to calm my nerves. I've had blood work numerous times just two weeks ago too all is normal. Ive had head  , neck, stomach also had chest x ray and stomach x ray. MRI of head. Blood work for mono,  , celiac, etc all negative. Doctor said if she thought it was cancerous she would have sent me on somewhere by now. I just wondered if anyone had any similar experiences or could shed some positive light my way. I'm almost 21 with a 7 month old baby. I've never had anything wrong with me so this is difficult. Also had my   removed, and nodes are still there. Any feedback is nice. I know no one here can diagnosis just looking for feedback. Thanks 0 likes, 28 replies "
