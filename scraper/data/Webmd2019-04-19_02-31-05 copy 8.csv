Heart Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/70820/proximal-and-mid-lad-stents,Proximal and mid LAD stents,"Hello, first time posting here. I'm looking for some support on my recent heart health issues. I'm a 43 y/o male nonsmoker. I have significant family history of poor heart health on my mothers side. I won't go into all of the specifics unless to keep this as short as possible. Here's my story: Around the first of this year I noticed some occasional dull achy chest pain. Was very sporadic and could happen at any time. This eventually became more and more frequent. In March I was sitting at work and was feeling the dull ache when I had an episode of sudden intense chest pain that doubled me over and caused SOB, nausea, and extreme sweating. A couple of weeks later I had some extreme SOB after moving a heavy object. My PCP did a work up (chest xray, holter monitor, ekg). All was normal except for ekg shows bradycardia (I exercise frequently). Cardiologist was not impressed but offered to order a stress test or CTA of Heart for my peace of mind. Being and xray tech, I opted for the CTA and it was positive for LAD stricture. On May 30th a Heart cath revealed an 80% ""widow maker"" stenosis in the mid LAD. Stent was placed and after increasing my workout routine I felt like a new man after a couple of weeks, all symptoms gone. Afterwards I correlated extreme fatigue and dizziness. Fast forward a couple of months and the dull achy pain starts coming back along with fatigue. On 9/27 I was jogging and had some pretty intense chest pain along with nausea and sweating. A trip to the ER and a heart cath later in the day and they find another 75% stenosis even more proximal in the LAD. Another stent was placed. F/u with my cardiologist was interesting. He doesn't feel that either stenting explained any of my symptoms and he couldn't explain why the other blockage happened so quickly. I'm still having the dull achy pressure/pain along with dizziness and sporadic SOB. On 10/16 I was also having some sharp stabbing type pain as well so I went to ER AGAIN. Nothing was found, troponin was ok. Was kept overnight for observation. Eventually the pains stopped in the night. My PCP is not satisfied that what has been done is sufficient. Based on the location of these blockages, he's concerned that maybe a bypass was the correct option from the start. Both interventionalists mentioned the possibility of by pass before each stent. My cardiologist says I need to be seen in a tertiary facility and I have an apt to see a specialist on 11/9. It's hard to correlate all of the things that I'm experiencing, but I know that something is not right with me. Any information or ideas would be very welcome. Thanks in advance to anyone who took the time to read all of this.",Heart Disease

I weight about 285lbs and am only 5'4"". I do have known issues with acid reflux and I had a stomach ulcer within the last year and esophagitis? I am trying to eat better and less, but still I struggle. Recently, since around January, I have been having strange chest pains. My left side of my chest hurts almost every day, some days it doesn't though, but those days are rare. My left arm has an uncomfortable pain aswell... It's not really painful, like a sharp or stabbing pain would be, but it's really uncomfortable and feels like something is wrong if that makes sense. I will randomly become very weak, shaky and feel like I will pass out. I've been getting the most intense head pains, on the sides where my temples are and have never had headaches like it before in my life. Also at random times, even when not doing anything, my chest will feel like it's pumping hard and fast as if I just ran or something. I want to exercise but I am actually scared to at this point. And the worst part of it all is that I cannot sleep at all! For months now, whenever I lay down I can barely breathe. I am usually a side sleeper but that is not even an option now, and can barely sleep on my back either. I try to sleep sitting up but I am just so miserable and uncomfortable. I want to go to my doctor to maybe get my heart checked out, but she always just kind of brushes me off and says ""You're morbidly obese, you need to lose weight and exercise and you will feel better."" Is that true or should I be pushing for more to be looked at? I mean I'm sure it would help and I know that it needs to be done but I feel like I'm about to drop dead.  A few other things to mention:  -My breasts are very very large and heavy, so heavy and large that they cover my whole stomach. Maybe they are too heavy for my chest and my arm is constantly off to the side because they can't rest against my sides due to my gigantic breasts.  -I recently had a blood test done, in I think December, to see if I had a problem with my thyroid. It came back that I do not have a problem with it, but surely she would see if I had other problems right, so I should be okay? -My dad died from an undetected enlarged heart, which led to a brain aneurysm. He went to the doctor almost twice a month and the coroner told us his heart was 3x the size of a normal heart.  I guess my question is just, should I look for another doctor since I feel that mine doesn't listen to me or do anything when I tell her how badly I feel or is it just because I am so fat and I have to deal with it until I lose a massive amount of weight?","Exercise , Diet , Heart Failure , Heart Attack , Heart Disease"

I’ve tried nothing for it yet except recently putting paw paw cream on it. It dries out even to a small amount onto my two ball fellas right beside. Is it just jock itch? Or is it something else? It also has a few tiny red spots I take are from the skin cracking but I’m not too sure. What can I do???

I ejaculated in her mouth, and then the experience was over, which I immediately regretted. This was my first time engaging in this kind of risky behaviour with someone I did not know. When I got home, I washed my penis with soup. I think I even put shampoo inside. I was pretty rigorous, as I felt very dirty from the behaviour. Of course, the shampoo hurt and made me feel stinging sensations at the tip of my penis. Next, I went and got myself tested on December 19 for everything imaginable. The big ones were HIV, HSV, chlamydia, gonorrhoeae, syphilis, hep B, and hep C, which all turned out negative. I felt good about that until I opened my pee hole and looked inside. The bottom wall or canal of the urethra was white in colour. It is slightly raised and it seemingly travels down the urethra tube for as far as I can see with a flashlight. I immediately panicked and realized I did all my tested way too soon. I can’t remember if I was feeling stinging inside the tip of my penis before looking inside, or if it started again after, but either way I have been feeling discomfort ever since December 15, and with the white appearance I see inside, I’m in even more discomfort. So on December 29 (2 weeks after high risk incident), I took a test for HSV 1 and 2, and it came back negative again. On January 2 (2 weeks + 4 days), I took a test for chlamydia and gonorrhoeae, which also both came back negative again. Still, the tip of my penis was irritating me. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. My underwear was bothering me. I felt rubbing against the fabric. It was getting red on the exterior of the tip of my penis, and I was frantically always checking, touching, and squeezing open. I even tried masturbating several times through this tough experience simply to see if that would get rid of the pressure and irritation I was feeling, but it only seemed to make things worse. I was feeling like my life was over. I’ve cried myself to sleep two times. That’s how shaken up I’ve been. So I went to see a doctor on January 6 who was not mine, because I felt ashamed to see my own. My doctor is actually quite rude and makes me feel uncomfortable, always brushing me off like my problems and concerns are not worthwhile. That’s besides the point though... so I saw a doctor and she gradually looked and just told me it was my urethra and not to worry. I tried taking that to heart but I felt like she didn’t even look closely. Just peered over and probably my angling of my penis towards her visual perspective was not the right angle, because from my vantage point I could clearly see it, while she sat in her chair not getting up to try and look. So as I reassessed that moment, I regressed back to my worries. On January 29, I went to see my doctor. He didn’t know what it was. I asked him if it’s normal? He said, “What is normal?” I said I don’t know, I’m not a doctor. He said anything can be normal. He berated me for even worrying and told me not to have sexual contact without protection, and yes I know, I get it that I screwed up. I have this mysterious irritation though with this mysterious appearance, and so I need answers. He took a swab for HSV, and I’m awaiting those results. I have another urine test to do to check for chlamydia or gonorrhoeae, but I feel like this will all come back negative again. My doctor thinks it could be HPV. I have had genital warts before on my scrotum, but those haven’t appeared for over a year and a half, going onto two years. Never had a bad breakout of that. It was so minor. Removed with the ice freezing or whatever it was, and they haven’t returned. Could this whiteness inside my urethra really be HPV? If so, how would I get rid of that? I asked my doctor, and he said you don’t. But really? If I can’t get rid of it, will I become infertile? Basically I am looking for answers. I have no answers at this point. I’m very confused. I can draw up any possibility without any concrete confidence that I’m correct about anything Help needed, please and thank you!","Chlamydia , HPV/Genital Warts , Men's Issues , Gonorrhea , Genital Herpes"

I do get vaginal yeast infections easily but I always know cause I'll get the discharge that goes with it and intense itching.

The coroner found asolutely nothing in the autopsy. He told my counselor that after conferring with other coroners that he felt his death was due to heart arrhythmia. His death certificate says “undetermined” because the coroner cannot prove that was the cause because an episode of arrhythmia doesn't leave any signs or cause damage that can be seen. He also told her that he felt that even if I would have been there, it would not have helped because he appeared to have died immediately. I found him so I know what the scene looked like; he had been lying there for approx. 8 hours. Actually at this point I don't want to think otherwise. I know that its probably true but my heart breaks that I wasn't there & possibly could have done something.  My son literally dropped dead. He was still holding his toothbrush so I feel certain he didn’t even try to break his fall.  My question(s) is whether it is possible that at times his heartbeat was off but he just accepted it and did not find it alarming? He played soccer from 1st grade to 12th grade. I would have thought it would have presented itself during those active times.  He was healthy and so he didn't visit the doctor on any kind of regular basis. He did have major ear infections and tubes were placed in his ears on 3 separate occasions before the age of 7. He had one other surgery at the age of 18 to have his adenoids removed , so he was in surgery four times in his life. Is it really possible that there were no signs of trouble but then have one episode that killed him?  At the time of his death he was under a lot of stress about his higher education. He had just grafuated with a bachelors degree & was under a time constraint. Although he always had a very high-strung temperament he did fine in life but at home he could be trying, lol! He was always moving, it seemed, and had some anxiety but managed to control it. He presented some depression signs when away at college which I recognized because of my own depression.  I know there is no absolute final answer. It has been 8 years but as a Mother it never leaves me. I do not feel guilt so I'm not looking for absolution. I think I just want to know how someone can appear to be so healthy (he did smoke & drink but moderately) & then drop dead 4 hours later? How can that happen? Did I miss some signs? Did he?  I know I rambled on & I scattered some questions throughout. I understand that knowing more information does not change anything.

I started having this symptom a year ago and it’s been reoccurring every now and then. The thing is, the rash only appears on my pubic hair region. I had unprotected sexual intercourse twice before with my partner. I had a total of 3 check ups. The first time was on March 2017. I was negative for HIV but postivie for a mild STI infection. The name of the disease which I forgot was something called “cocci”, but the one in-charge said that it was just mild. I was given a medicine for it but I was not able to have a follow up check up to know if I was cured or not since I had to go abroad the next day. The penile discharged that I was experiencing was gone so I thought I got better. To be sure, some time between late April and early of May 2017, I went to the social health clinic of Manhattan in New York. I took a urine and blood test there as well as an examination on the rash. They couldn’t tell what rash it was since It was almost healed and Ibwas advised to go back when it’s still fresh so that they can get a sample. The results came back two weeks later and it says online that I was fine. There were no diseases or any STD found. I was still having the rash and that’s when I decided to go back and asked if the rash that I was having was Herpes. The personnel said that it could not be Herpes since the result I got was all clean and he said if there’s anything that I’ve got then it should have shown in their test. Based on my research online, there is a separate test for Herpes and it includes blood test which I had in the clinic but was not sure if detecting Herpes was one of it. I got back to my country and had my follow up check up some time between August and September 2017. The result was also negative for any STD including my previous infection. Also, when I’m just at home, I only wear boxers ‘til I go to bed and I just started wearing boxers last 2 years. My country also has a hot weather since I live in South-East Asia. So I think that it’s just a rash from being sweaty and exposure to bacteria.  Attached to this post are the pictures of my rash on my pubic hair region. Herpes photos online resembles to my rash but I’m still hoping that it’s just a normal rash.  Thank you for any answers or suggestions and please respect my post.",Genital Herpes

The infection is on the head of my penis underneath my foreskin. I have had this infection before and it lasted for 5 years. During the time I had it before I saw 7 doctors in Canada about it including 2 dermatologists and none of them were able to help me. What eventually got rid of it the last time was overhauling my diet, exercising every day, and cleaning it with vinegar in the shower every day. What seems to trigger the infection is food like mcdonalds, pizza hut etc. I had a week about 3 months ago where I was living on airport food and the infection came back, and I can't get it to go away again. I am not a diabetic, I had a sugar test about a year and a half ago, the doctor said my sugar levels were high, and since then i have reduced my sugar intake by about 80%. My diet now is very healthy, I exercise regularly, I do not overeat, I am not overweight, I take a multi-vitamin every day, and I only drink water. Clotrimazole and Fluconazole seem to help a little bit but are not strong enough to get rid of the infection completely and after about a week on either of the medications the infection just becomes immune to them. Are there any other stronger creams or drugs out there that I could try to try and get rid of this infection. - Note: please do not suggest natural and herbal remedies... I have tried them all and they do nothing.",Men's Issues

She coughed up Blood 2 weeks ago and is not a smoker. In November, when I knew something was wrong; I told her to go the ER - I made her go quite honestly. They did an EKG, and said everything was fine and her heart looked good. I know she has a lung problem, thyroid problem and possibly a brain problem. I am positive because of handwriting analysis. I backed off for a while after her EKG was good because I was worrying her and my parents were both getting upset. She had mild and completely random - maybe once a week or once every two weeks - problems with her memory. She had random leg pain only in one leg and she didn’t know how to describe it. She had a minor and very little cough I think she has been hiding from me. In December, around Christmas, she was watching my baby and she said she reached for something behind the radio and pulled a muscle. I kept telling her to go make sure that was all it was and she just kept ignoring it. She had the pain to where at times I could tell it was bothering her and at times it hurt her to sit and feed my baby when she visited which really bugged me. This pain she had was in her upper left quadrant (near her ribs and she described it as basically from the front of the lower rib area to the back of the lower rib area). She never had it looked at! It hurt her for ATLEAST a month probably more like 2 months.  I have noticed her “tripping” or losing balance for the past 3-6 months but it is becoming more and more often. I said something to her almost every time I seen it happen and she brushes it off as if nothing happened. Well, it has got more and more frequent to the point I’m worried she will fall and really hurt herself or while holding my baby, fall and hurt my baby along with herself!! :(  Also, she told me just recently she has been having a lot more symptoms than I realized. I made her go to the ER last night with the following symptoms: -Coughed up blood clot 2 weeks ago -Fatigue -Anxiety and Stress (she attributes to being from her job and some of it probably is) -Feels like it’s hard to swallow -she is always clearing her throat -recently I see her grabbing her neck more and more (universal sign for choking) -lack of balance -dry cough -feels like she is congested -coughed up almost a 1 inch blood clot less than 2 weeks ago -Charlie horse pains often in her right foot and lower leg (sign of DVT) -she described to me she “felt like there was a blood clot in her neck”  -she physically looks drained -she seems to know something is wrong -she is forgetting things she never should forget (she bought my baby an elephant and it’s head and ears flap - she was SO happy to show my baby this toy and less than ONE or TWO months later, she asked me who got it for my daughter!! I almost cried because I know something is wrong. Her grandma had mini strokes often and her grandma and grandpa were both on blood thinners. Last night they gave her a contrast ct of her chest, blood work and d-dimer and told her she did not have a PE or lun cancer. They didn’t even check her right leg for a DVT!  She is also lightheaded and said she gets dizzy when she goes to lay straight back or when she touches or lays on a specific area on the back top of her head.  They didn’t even do an MRI!!!! They released her with a diagnosis of coughing up blood - they didn’t even do enough testing to find out wtf is going on!!!!! Please help. Before her contrast ct last night they gave her Ativan via her IV... she went to work after the hospital without sleeping even though she assured me she would sleep.

I am going to type a letter with all of her symptoms and demand they admit me her and find out what is causing all of these symptoms. I’m frustrated and disgusted with the care she is receiving. I also took her to the PCP on Monday last week who listened and said that it couldn’t be a PE because coughing blood isn’t a sign of a PE (MORON) and he ordered a CBC diff and lipid panel or whatever and a CT without contrast which he said needed a pre with from insurance.","AFib , High Blood Pressure , Heart Failure , Heart Attack , Heart Disease , Cholesterol Control"

He considers it minor, because it is not very wide, probably not more than 1/8 or 1/4 of an inch, and it connects more to the underside of the head rather than farther up the head of the penis. The medical term is ""penile skin bridge"". Fortunately it doesn't cause any pain during an erection or masturbating, so his issues are purely cosmetic. He feels too embarrassed to talk to his parents about it, and he has discovered online that a surgery to fix it would cost more than a thousand dollars (not sure how accurate that is). Another solution could be to remove it himself, but the thought is gruesome and scary. He could consider leaving it there, but he really really really just wants it to be gone and heal fast, so his penis looks normal. Some questions he has are if he is too young to get the surgery, if it would be painful, if it would reduce pleasure, if it would still look weird later, other possible solutions, and how to talk about it with his parents.

About 3 months ago I had sex with a girl from the Philippines. She was NOT a prostitute or a sex worker, just a normal girl. I used a condom every time, but one of the times we had sex the condom broke. About 6 weeks later I started experiencing some symptoms that made me think I had a urinary tract infection/ yeast infection that was unrelated to the sex i had had: Frequent urination, fungal looking rash on the penis under the foreskin. I have a history of getting these types of infections when I have a very poor diet and when I do not exercise. After noticing these symptoms I changed my diet, started exercising again, had no sexual contact or masturbation for 2 weeks, and the symptoms were all but gone when I had another sexual encounter. The day after the sexual encounter the symptoms returned along with some lower abdominal pain, testicular swelling and tenderness, and a clear but sometimes cloudy discharge from the end of my penis. I assumed the urinary tract/yeast infection was back but 2 weeks later it was still not gone and the girl I had recently had sex with informed me that she had been to the doctor and the doctor told her that she had Colpitis/Vaginitis. The doctor prescribed her ""Nifuratel and Nysfungin Vaginal Soft Capsules"" and ""Cefpodoxime Proxetil Tablets."" I went to 10 different pharmacies looking for the Cefpodoxime but none of them had it. None of them had any doxycycline either, so I bought Ciprofloxacin. I have been taking 1g of Cipro every 12 hours for the last 12 days. After 10 days of taking the antibiotics the discharge was gone, the frequent urination was gone, but I still had the rash under the foreskin and, less often, but occasional testicular swelling and tenderness and lower abdominal pain. I masturbated for the first time 2 days ago (still taking the antibiotics) and now all of the symptoms have returned in full force along with swelling and redness around my pee hole. There is no pain or burning during urination, the discharge is always clear, except when I wake up in the morning it is cloudy. Not sure what else I can say about it.

I'm a female & 46 years old. On February 2 I went to the ER because I was losing vision in my right eye. I was terrified. They discovered that my blood pressure was 270/150. They treated me, got the bp down a little and sent me home (crazy!). I visited an eye doctor that day and he said that I had suffered an eye stroke in my right eye due to uncontrolled high blood pressure. Back story, I'd been diagnosed with high bp about eight years ago but quit taking my meds because I didn't like my doctor. I felt fine so I figured it was fine. Dumb! So anyhow, we're assuming my bp has been incredibly high all these years. So, fast forwarded back to February. The next morning my bp was rising again and I was concerned so we went back to the ER. They admitted me that time, thankfully, and I was there for about four days. My bp seemed to be getting under control with the medication they put me on and it was 158/99 when they released me. Still high but much better. I was placed on 2 bp meds - Carvedilol 25 MG twice a day & Amlodipine 10 MG once a day - and told to follow up with a hypertension specialist and my family doctor. I also purchased a bp monitor and began taking my bp various times throughout the day. After a few weeks it was obvious the medication was working for sure because I was averaging about 125/82, sometimes much lower too. Unfortunately, I was feeling rotten. I was sleeping 12 to 13 hours at night and still needed two or three naps throughout the day. When I was awake I felt like a complete zombie. Miserable.  I had an appointment with the specialist on February 27. He said that the reason I was feeling so awful was because my body was trying to adjust to my bp being so much lower after being so incredibly high for so many years. He decided to raise my bp up to about 140/90 in hopes that I'd feel better. In order to do that he cut my Carvedilol down to 12.5 MG twice a day but left the Amlodipine the same. He said if that didn't work we'd cut the Amlodipine down to 5 MG once a day too. Well, it worked.....kind of. My bp is still only averaging about 130/85, sometimes alittle higher or lower. But hardly ever even close to 140/90. I'm able to stay awake more but I still feel rotten. I'm tired and weak all the time. I have some dizziness and feel out of breath sometimes. Plus my brain just feels ""foggy"" all the time. I'm frustrated! I finally had an appointment with my family doctor on March 19 (she'd had an emergency and wasn't available for quite some time). She thinks I'm okay the way I am. She wants to keep the meds the same and thinks I need to start walking on the treadmill. I am overweight and know I need to lose weight but right now the idea of walking on a treadmill is crazy to me. I'm so tired all the time. I'm lucky to stay awake and carry on a conversation. I'm seriously considering cutting the Amlodipine down to 5 MG once a day to see if that will help. I""m thinking it'll get me closer to the 140/90 goal that my specialist wants. Plus I've read a lot that Amlodipine can be very sedating. I'll be monitoring my bp closely and if it rises too high I'll go back to taking the 10 MG.  I'm just curious if any of you have had this type of thing. Have any of you lost vision in one of your eyes due to high bp? My vision still hasn't come back, by the way. The doctors say it may but it may not, they don't really know. And, also, have any of you experienced a situation like mine where you had incredibly high bp for a long time & have now lowered it significantly? Did you feel rotten all the time? How long did it take for you body to adjust to the lower bp?",High Blood Pressure

It feels like my heart or something near it at least. Its different than past symptoms. I havent been this sure of something being heart-related or mimicking it in forever. Thats why Im worried. Here’s what’s going on.  -Been having this strange feeling almost like a deep gulping or flipping in the center of my chest. Feels identical to a strong heart beat but its just one. A single strong ”bah--dum”. Can happen all day long off and on. Its accompanied by strange gurgling and tightening esophagus feelings that I also had long ago (feel like GERD but no heartburn at all). Liquid does come up a bit in my throat when this happens. Ive also, when dozing off or right about to close my eyes and nap Im jolted awake (not the classic falling feeling or hyptic jerk) but this chest feeling again. It jolts me and rises up in me and I visibly am rattled. its so bizarre. I have sleep apnea. Could it be related? This feeling feels so much like my heart. Could it be a premature heart beat? Esophogeal spasm? (I read that those are painful but this is not) Vagal nerve-related? Mitral Valve? could it be GERD after all and that old endoscopy was wrong?

At this same time my bladder was not responding when I tried to push urine out. These things lasted 2--3 weeks.   Then about one year ago I had this bizarre feeling that I only had partial control of my muscles. I could walk but but I just did not feel normal. I was admitted to hosp. via ER because my symptoms looked like I was having a stroke. Nothing further happened and I was released the next day The ""best guess diagnosis"" was a delayed reaction to the drug Latuda , which I had been taking for 7 months. I now have episodes of this tingling in left arm several times (10--12?) each day. My left arm also tingles when I lie in bed on my right side (but not left). Earlier this month (12/2016) I had the overall numbness and decreased control over my entire body, again resembling a stroke.

Im really worried, though, that I have gotten really loose from having so much sex. I think it feels a lot different now. He is about 8 inches hard and 6 inches around. When we first were having sex, he would ""hit it from the back"" and it would hurt pretty bad(in a good way) because I think he was hitting my cervix/g spot. He couldnt even put it all the way in.

It doesnt feel as good as it once did because my vagina doesnt feel like its gripping his penis as tight.

Before, it felt like he was breaking me because I felt so small. I did in the beginning feel my vagina tear and it would hurt for awhile after. I never let it heal and we kept having sex. Now it doesnt even get torn. Sometimes he would try to put it in before I was fully aroused/lubricated. Could this have stretched out my labia?

(I'm not sure if this is related, but my tooth chipped and my dentist put me on penicillin a week before the defibrillator went off. The doctors and dentist said it was okay to take)  They tried putting me on mexilietine after the shock. I didn't react well to it, and my heart continued to have racing episodes.  I'm now on sotalol as well as metroprolol and Lisinopril. My heart hasn't raced on sotalol. I actually now have episodes of bradycardia. I have been on it for over a month now, and I broke out into a rash last night. My doctor has me taking Benadryl for it. He hasn't seen the rash.  The sotalol has stopped my heart from racing, but I have been extremely tired and irritable since starting it. It makes going back to normal life extremely difficult. I go into work late because getting up is hard. I definitely feel depressed too.  They're unable to find an explanation for why this is happening to my heart.  Do you have any suggestions on what to do? They've performed every test possible and are unable to find anything. Is it normal for trial and error on medications and not finding a cause and cure? I've tried switching doctors, but no one has been able to find much information out.  Thanks for any help!!",

I have had them treated by freezing multiple times throughout my life. About 5 years ago, a wart developed on my lower abdomen, about 4 inches beneath my navel. I went to a dermatologist and had it frozen. At a follow up appointment the doctor decided to scrape the remainder of it and have it tested since I have had a few skin cancers removed previously. Well, I was contacted by my doctor again today who said that the wart tested positive for HPV 6/11 which makes it a genital wart even though it was on my lower abdomen. The wart has been there for about 5 years and I have been with my wife for 19 years. I have been completely monogamous for the entire 19 years that we have been together. The doctor said I must have contracted the virus a little while before the wart showed up, so well into my marriage. She said a couple of weeks to two years maximum. She said that there is no way that the virus could have been dormant for 14 years (it has been there for 5). So, if I have been monogamous and I trust that my wife has been as well...the question is how the heck did I get it? Is it possible to transmit HPV 6/11 by touch? Any other way besides sexual contact? If not, then I must have gotten it from my wife? So assuming that she has been monogamous as well, how did she get it?

My journey started in September 2011, but it seemed to be a one-time occurrence and I could directly relate my 'episode' to something stupid I did. One night I took my friend's hydrocodone pills (please don't judge). The next day I started feeling a weird hot feeling in my sternum (not like heartburn), then I immediately felt the urge to have a BM, went to bathroom and then started feeling dizzy, lightheaded, seeing stars. Sweating profusely, laid down on bathroom floor, then felt urge for BM again, then it just kind of happened back and forth until BM was complete - all while dry heaving too.  December 2011 - my cousin was in the hospital after a terrible car accident, he looked awful. I had to run out of the room then collapsed in the hall and had same episode as above. September/October 2012 - I was really sick, might have been the flu, took a medication prescribed to my dad to help with fever, body aches, chills. Next day I went to class, started feeling sick, so I got up to go the bathroom, I collapsed in the doorway. Started having an episode - actually threw up this time. Ambulance came, but since I was 17 and coherent I could not consent to them taking me to the ER. I do remember them saying my blood pressure was low. Went to PCP and she said the only way to tell what was going on was if I was in the middle of the episode and they took my vitals. Dec. 2013/Jan. 2014 - I was getting my 2nd colonoscopy done, so the day before I had to cleanse. I probably did not hydrate enough and I definitely was not eating. Morning of the colonoscopy I had an episode. December 2016 - One night went to dinner mixed different alcohols, did not eat much food. Went on to mix very strong alcohols. Woke up still drunk, went back to sleep, then woke up again and had an episode. February 2017 - Went out for bachelorette party, did not eat much dinner, mixed a lot of alcohol. Woke up drunk, then when that wore off I had an episode. September 2017 - It was a normal Friday, I ate dinner and was full. I had some wine 24 hours beforehand, but did not get drunk and had plenty of water and food between. I started feeling hot and sick around 3 AM, forced self to lay down - then was taken home by a friend (I was at a retreat). When I got home I had a BM and felt better. Next day I was at lunch and I was really nervous I would have another episode. Went to a store that was a little crowded, started feeling hot and sick. Stepped outside, felt a little better, then it started hitting me. Got to car and started having episode, was able to hold in BM. Got home had BM, laid down with cool rag because I was sweating so much, but cold at the same time then fell asleep. Next 2 days I was fine, that Tuesday I was in class and started feeling sick, so I stepped outside, but it didn’t help, so I went back to class grabbed my stuff and left to go home. I was lightheaded and nauseous on my way home (which I know wasn’t smart to drive), I was sweating a lot and laid down with a cool rag then fell asleep eventually. That Friday I went to PCP, she suggested I see a cardiologist for POTS. It was hard for me to go to the cardiologist because I was out of town at school.  I had anxiety in public places because I was always scared I was going to have an episode. November 2017 – I was driving from Lubbock to Dallas, I had eaten a grilled cheese and a few tater tots from Sonic. About an hour into the drive I started feeling dizzy, had the burning sensation in sternum, hot, shaky, felt I needed to have a BM. My friend came and picked me up and drove me home and we got my car later.  December 2017 – I was driving from Dallas to Lubbock, I had eaten a little bit of a sandwich, and had powerade. I started feeling the burning sensation in sternum, got dizzy, pulled over, I was hot, shaky, nauseous, and I actually had a BM – I was not anywhere near a gas station/restroom. Mom drove to pick me up, about an hour and a half out. The night before I had a glass of wine, but I ate dinner and did not feel tipsy or a buzz even. January 2018 – went snowboarding. Felt bad when I woke up, ate breakfast, had BM, felt ok, started driving and about 2 miles from the hotel had to turn around because I started feeling an episode. I had another BM, then rode up front the rest of the way and felt extremely nauseous the whole drive (50 minutes). While snowboarding, a little higher on the mountain (I went on the smallest ski lift), I started feeling hot, nauseous and felt a BM, I tried to breathe and cool down, then it went away.  There have been a few mornings where I wake up with a racing heart and feeling very hot, but I force myself to stay laying down even though I feel very nauseous or like I need to have a BM. Eventually the feeling of hot and racing heart will calm down after 30-45 minutes, then I get up and have a BM and feel better. I finally saw a cardiologist in February and told her all my symptoms, they did orthostatic vitals, and my blood pressure is lower than normal and gets lower upon standing. Her suspicions are POTS/orthostatic hypotension. I’m just not sure if I should be seeking another type of doctor to talk about other issues that could be causing low blood pressure and these symptoms or if I’m on the right track. I had an echo done, which was normal. I had bloodwork done to test for magnesium and a couple other things which was all normal. I got an ETT done and I don’t think the results are back for that yet. But after about 12 minutes on the treadmill I started feeling very dizzy and nauseous, they wanted to get me to the HR of 168, so I did, but my blood pressure never went over 104/60.  On my way home from the ETT I ran out of gas on the highway and had to wait for someone to come with a gas tank, so I’m not sure if it was an anxiety attack or what. But I had an episode in the car and had a BM, in the car, in the middle of the highway.  I feel nauseous many days when I wake up and my blood pressure will be on the lower side.  I try and consume more sodium and drink a lot more water. I have cut out soda. I take Lexapro and Welbutrin. Has anyone else experienced these symptoms or something similar? Does it seem like I’m on the right track? Side note: I also used to see a pediatric gastro from 16-19 due to stomach issues. I would have diarrhea more often than normal, have abdominal cramping, a lot of gas build up that would cause a lot of pain, etc. I’ve had 2 colonoscopies done, which came back normal. I’ve had a hytascan which came back normal. My GI suggested chronic appendicitis and had me see a general surgeon, but the surgeon wouldn’t perform the surgery without proof of appendicitis. Then I stopped seeing the GI because I am no longer a minor and I just haven’t sought out someone new. I also had a laparoscopic exploratory surgery in my uterus to check for endometriosis, which I do not have. But before the surgery I had an ultrasound and my dr told me that I definitely have some sort of colon issue because there was a lot of built up gas in my stomach and it was hurting to press down on my stomach.",

History: ADD, asthma. Problem: Numb spots on testicles/penis - which has slowly gotten to the point where I cannot feel my orgasms / just recently began having ED in the middle of business and I ejaculate sperm (even though I am tightening my kegel muscle) before I reach my actual orgasm. Things that have been done: Testosterone test, blood work, MRI, loose clothes, less masturbation, standing more. I have a high sex drive and to be honest I've probably masturbated at the minimum every other day since 13 if not every day. A year and a half ago I started experiencing numb spots while masturbating. It's hard to explain and I will attach a picture to point out where I am experiencing it.  Eventually it's gotten to the point where I've noticed quite a few things.  1)When I orgasm my testicle's texture changes (this could be normal and me just paranoid).  2) Releasing sperm before feeling/achieving orgasm (this is a new symptom and not normal - I know my body and used to have really good kegal muscles that I could control). I start to build up to my orgasm and I'm already shooting sperm before it ""hits"". This also happens during sex.  3)I always seemed to produce a healthy amount of sperm but as of late it seems to be extremely low.  4) I've noticed low to no precum which is not common for me 5) Penis head is fairly numb to the point I can run a finger across it and it isn't super sensitive. On occasion after orgasm the ""sensitivity"" comes back. 6) Blowjobs from my partner are like throwing my penis into the wind. I used to enjoy oral - now I can no longer feel it. 7) ED during sex (new) Doctor told me he has no idea. Neurologist said he found a minor slipped disk in my spine but it was NOT causing my issues. Urologist shrugged and said there wasn't really much he could do besides give me blue pills.  I have NO bathroom problems. NO pain. I do have hemorrhoids that pop out anytime I stool. A few years back I remember getting an infection (I'm uncut) and eventually it cleared up with proper cleaning but noticed a bit after that small sores would appear on my head. There also seemed to be a layer of what I'd say is like dead tissue on my head that I could scrape off.  This was years ago however but it might relate, who knows. I also would sometimes get a sharp stabbing pain if I stopped my peeing half way through. Usually in the gooch/behind the testicles area. I've read this is fairly common but throwing it out there anyway. I apologies for the length - I'm usually very private but at this point I am becoming super frustrated.",Men's Issues

For the past several months I've been experiencing a dull aching pain in the left lower portion of my jaw with a simultaneous dull aching in my left arm which tends to be felt on the inner forearm. It will generally last a few minutes at a time and will sometimes come in waves. A few times I felt pressure in my chest as well. I am 100% positive it is not musculoskeletal as it is not relieved by re-positioning, nor is it initiated by any type of movement, it is not tender to the touch and is unaffected by pressing anywhere. The last few times it seemed to be brought on by strenuous activity such as jogging or in one instance when my adrenaline started pumping for a specific reason. However, another strange symptom that I've noticed in conjunction with this is a very subtle and slight sensation of gas or bloating in my lower abdomen. It's so subtle that I did not even notice it the first few times this occurred but it definitely seems to be associated with each episode. It is not painful or uncomfortable in anyway or associated with any flatulence and only sometimes has resulted in minor burping. What I would like to know is can NORMAL levels of gas traveling through the digestive tract affect the same nerves which will mimic heart related problems? I feel that strenuous activity can also be associated with digestive activity or distress which could bring about these symptoms. It is also not related to indigestion, which I never get. There is no burning sensation in my chest.",

The last few months I've started having chest pains especially when I have anxiety attacks. I bought a blood pressure and pulse reader so I could keep an eye on it. I've been checking it every few hours while awake. During the day my blood pressure stays extremely low averaging around 88/55. I've been told by doctors before that I have low blood pressure so this doesn't surprise me. My pulse averages around 85 while at rest with occasional spikes that go closer to 100. After 7 pm my blood pressure starts rising up to what most would consider a normal rate around 110/68 but my pulse drops to around 55. Some nights if I stay up late my heart rate will occasionally start racing for no apparent reason and get as high as 115 but my blood pressure doesn't change when this happens. It takes about 20 minutes for my pulse to drop back to a normal level. I know some ups and downs throughout the day are normal but I'm afraid this is too much. I'm sure my anxiety plays a small part because last week during a major attack my pulse topped out at 124. I've tried researching this but everything I find talks about high blood pressure. Could use some advice. Should I be worried?,

No doctor ever took me seriously because I'm still young (33 years old), blamed it on anxiety and then said I had asthma.  A few weeks ago I blacked out while driving, that was my third blackout within 2 months. They did a 3 day holter monitor and saw that my heart rate dropped to 46 beats a minute, I have a first degree AV block, low frequency ventricular ectopy and sinus arrhythmia throughout. A week later (1 week ago), they implanted a Medtronic reveal linq cardiac monitor to watch my heart rate over a longer period (up to 3 years).  Online I read that patients will receive a monitor which transmits data to the cardiologist 24/7. I only received a patient assistant with which I can record 4 episodes of symptoms every 6 months. What's the point of that? What if I have more episodes? Or a very low heart rate/irregular heartbeat without symptoms? Do I just ignore it? Why would they implant a device like that and then don't monitor results? I don't want this monitor inside of my body if I can only record 4 episodes every 6 months. I have symptoms every single week. They also never explained anything to me.

I had a complete cardiac work up. I went through a number of tilt tests. I was put on at least six different meds and given tilt tests to see if the meds were helping.  None of the meds helped, but many of them had harsh side effects. With Theophylline for example, my heart rate was running about 30 beats per minute faster than normal, I felt like I was burning up most of the time and I could only sleep about 2 hours a night. I lost ten pounds in a week. And I am in pretty good shape to begin with.  Fast forward to now and I had another syncopal episode.  Are there any newer treatments? Looking on the internet I see the same drugs mentioned that I was put on ten years ago with out good results. Then and now there is talk of using pacemakers, but not any enthusiasm.  I saw two electrophysiologists ten years ago. Talking with the better of the two as I now understand, the problem, at least in my case isn't the heart. It is the medulla, the primitive part of the brain that controls blood pressure, heart rate and the other autonomic nervous system functions.  In the end, the best advice I got was try and avoid triggers for syncopal episodes. I live a healthy life style. But there are triggers you can't avoid, now matter how much you try.  So what are the latest treatments? Anything new out there? By and large it appears that electrophysiologists treat syncope. But at least in my case it seems to be more of a problem with the medulla.

We used a condom for vaginal sex, he had a condom on for receiving oral sex, but I did not have protection when he gave me oral. It was just a slight vaginal irritation at first. But I'm diligent with STI testing, so I got tested for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, bacterial vaginosis, and trich which all came back negative. I was then prescribed Cipro for a UTI since I had a dipstick test that showed bacteria and high white blood cell count. Symptoms seemed to go away then come back a couple days after finishing antibiotics. So back to the walk-in doctor I went. This time they took a urine culture and did another dip test. Dip test showed high white blood cells again. So he prescribed me Septra while I waited for the urine culture. 4 days into the antibiotics and my symptoms had worsened. Constant urge to urinate and feeling of vaginal irritation up inside me. No pain, just irritation. Hard to explain. So I went back. Culture seemed to be ""inconclusive"" due to bacterial contamination or something- he was difficult to understand. Gave another urine sample and was sent home with my THIRD antibiotic Macrobid. Symptoms started dissipating after about day 4 and seemed to go away for about a week? Maybe less, then started coming back again. Made an appt with my family doctor and he did more swabs for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, trich, yeast which all came back negative again. He did a pelvic exam and didn't see any lesions inside me (unless they are further up- is that possible?). He also did a urine culture which came back negative this time. STILL having symptoms almost 7 weeks later and have now convinced myself (thank you anxiety and doctor Google) that I have urethral herpes or cancer or something. I know not all people have typical symptoms of herpes...I've been doing extensive googling and really don't know what else it could be. Getting super paranoid and anxious and would love some feedback! Lowdown- Symptoms: - Urinary urgency- especially after peeing. Typically dwindles away a bit if I don't go pee for a while. Seems to be worse at night right before going to sleep. Doesn't wake me up though and usually feels better in the morning, until I pee a couple times, that is. - Inside my vagina feels ""irritated"". No pain, no discharge, no smell, no lesions/blisters/etc. Just doesn't feel right. Again, hard to explain. Meds I am currently on (if that may mean anything): - Alesse birth control. - Synthroid for hypothyroid. - Also I get frequent headaches so I take Advil often.

Read ENTIRE POST prior to responding. Otherwise, allow others to answer","Before addressing my actual question, let me preface it with the following: I am fairly new, but highly competent, practicing ER veterinarian. I know how drugs work, what I should and shouldn't mix together, and typically try to make my best decisions when there are grey areas based on the clinical picture before me. While I feel that I do this well to dogs, cats, horses, and other non-humans species, I am not able to proficiently self-assess or provide anything but very cursory examination of a living human being. I have no illusions that because of my profession as a vet, it makes me remotely qualified to assess humans from a diagnostic standpoint, as I hope you have none that you would make a competent veterinary diagnostician without the training / background first. I just would like you to know that when you address my concerns, you can talk to me like a medical professional instead of the average layperson. I think the below entry will illustrate this to you quite effectively versus me just saying it is so. Unfortunately, with all that knowledge I have, it is my own irresponsible and potentially self-injurious behavior, that brings us to this point. And now I can start talking... First just some biographic info: 31 year old, adult male in average - below average physical condition. I currently weigh about 175 lbs and am six feet tall. I take three daily medications, 450mg Buproprion XL once daily, 600mg Gabapentin twice daily, and 5.7mg Zubsolv once a day.(more common formulation wound be Suboxone, or generic buprenorphine / nalaxone). I have been on all these drugs for about the same amount of time, approximately 7-8 years. The doses have not been changed in any way for any of them in recent years, the last being a reduction of my zubsolv 2 years ago by half. I am a semi-habitual drug user for the last 4-6 months, without any particular drug of choice at the moment. I don't discriminate other than I don't touch opiates any more - haven't once since being on the maintenance medications. I will even refuse them, and have, in the face of severe, refractory pain. I have not drunk any alcohol either for the same length of time as my abstinence from opiate drugs and pharmaceuticals. I do not wish to be moralized about drug use, and how it could be my license if I am caught, or that I could face legal / severe / other health issues, or any of the other stuff that I already know but ignore. If you can handle this, and think you know stuff about drug interaction and pharmacology, please read on and try to help me out as best you can. I already know the general answer to my ultimate question and what the safest thing to do is. However, sometimes the mind and body are telling each other something entirely different - this is one of those scenarios. Drug 11 (I will refer to it at this as the bag it came in had the number 11 on it, and only the number 11) produced dose-dependent, repeatable/reproducible increases in euphoria, awareness, concentration, and a perceived increase in general mental acuity. I have utilized amphetamine and methamphetamine in past on numerous occasions, as well as several of their analogues. The intensity of these effects produced by 11, lay somewhere right between the aforesaid drugs. Given the extraordinary noradrenergic and dopaminergic effects and their affinity for the respected receptors, and ability to cause their massive release, I believe this drug to be a probable analogue of methamphetamine. I know MDMA / MDA and other drugs like this have extraordinary similarity from a structural standpoint (as in they are both also analogues of the amphetamines), but I believe that because 11 lacks the psychedelic effects produced by and intended to occur with a good, average dose of MDMA, we are dealing with something much closer structurally to regular amphetamine or, more likely, methamphetamine. So, basically lacking an attached ring structure on the molecule. I feel that we are dealing with a drug that has a very strong affinity for noradrenergic and dopaminergic receptor binding, is causing release of their associated neurotransmitters by one of many different possible MoA, is inhibiting their re-uptake (also, take your pick as to the exact science, obviously we aren't going to know that here, sorry) or some combination thereof. I feel that the physical effects that 11 has had on me are nearly identical to a very large dose of amphetamine. This is why I leave out serotonin as a key player in 11. I know it has its role and function in the way amphetamine makes you feel while you are and aren't on it, but overall, the other two NTs are far more important in controlling MoA and drug behavior. I have yet to experience any significant down from the drug, which when I inevitably go through this, will provide me with some more potential insight into pharmacodynamic action. Potentially, this will even provide me with some (limited) insight into the pharmacokinetics, to the extent of onset and duration of action, methods of metabolism / excretion, and bioavailabilty through different RoA should I choose to utilize again.  Moving onto my actual concern, despite the fact that I am a vet, I am also a recreational drug user. I often venture into drugs of unknown chemical structure (aka research chemicals, unapproved for or untested for use in human use) that have had absolutely no testing performed in any official capacity by any official organization or respectable institution. My concern is how this one chemical, that very well fits the above description, has been having some mild to moderate cardiovascular side effects. I appear to have started experiencing dose-dependent sinus tachycardia, starting at 125 and reaching as high as about 150 BPM at what I imagine was the drugs peak plasma concentration. During my first course of ""experimentation"" I administered what have, if my drug concentration was what I had even come close to achieving (25-50mg / 1mL solution) was a total dose ranging in the 50-100mg over the course of about four to five hours. The total volume of fluid administered was approximately 1.8-2.0 mL through a series of five deltoid injections, spread apart both sides of my shoulders. This was for both practical and clinical purposes, as it is my understanding that exceeding 1.0 mL in a small muscle like the deltoids can effect the muscle, as well as slow / halt the absorption of whatever the substance delivered. I also know nothing about this drugs ability to cause abscess, the result of intramuscular extravasation to the subcutaneous tissue, or any possibility of tissue necrosis. Really, just picture picking up a random white powder sent to you in the mail from someone in China, diluting it in sterile water, and seeing what happens. In an attempt to have some semblance of harm reduction practice, I start with what I hope to me considered a low-dose, and titrate upward as needed, or downward when learning the hard way. I have noted four separate, but repeatably and reliably dose-dependent (in three of them) adverse effects of 11 that support my above conclusions about how the drug works. They include dry mouth, mild to moderate nausea (no resulting vomiting or causative reasons such as vertigo or vestibular disease), sinus tachycardia, and very mild perspiration (which I believe may have been an effect of coming off the drug, that I experienced for a couple of hours before making the decision to re-administer 10 mg additional IM in a new solution made at a lower (probably about 18 - 22 mg / 1 ml solution) concentration by about 15-25% . Of all the side effects the cardiac ones were most concerning, particularly as they got more pronounced with repeated, and more frequent administration. I believe that the tachycardia was likely at its highest when the drug was at its highest point of concentration in the plasma. Without know the drug's half life and a ton of other information, were not going to know what that plasma level was, and what other cardiotoxic effects this drug could cause at even higher levels. Once again, I know this is stupid, but it's what I have been doing for a long while, and I won't be stopping unless forced to by some circumstances, physical or otherwise.  Anyway, if we are operating under the assumption that this drug is moderately to markedly dopaminergic, it has the ability to cause vasodilation. I know in vet med, we use dopamine at low doses CRI (range of 1-5ug/kg/min) in order to produce cardiac positive inotropic results. It is extremely effective in doing so. While I realize that dopamine can also produce the opposite, and generally not as useful effects, at (much) higher doses, a drug such as pure crystal meth isn't even known to cause dopaminnergic bradycardia until you are in danger of overdosing. In fact, I believe that the bradycardia is the most sign and reason for fatalities associated with that drug - along with the other cardiotoxic effects it has over the long-term. While the nausea and dry-mouth I mentioned previously are typically side effects more closely-associated with serotoninergic drugs, I believe that the effects were mild and controllable because of the limited effect this neurotransmitter has on 11. I wish I had an MSDS for you, I really do, or some experimental data on a group of lab rats, but I simply don't. Just working off my own experiences with known similar drugs and a solid scientific background to try and make a decision about mixing this with another drug, one that has known vasodilatory effects. In all honestly, I would have chosen pharmacology instead of heart health had the choice been available to me on this site. However, I feel that a physician who sees lots of patients with heart problems on multiple drugs or better yet, a practicing cardiologist, would be able to give me their best guess working with the little concrete information available.  Also before I completely forget to mention, there was one other cardiac abnormality. I auscultated a grade 2/6 (that's how we grade them in vet med, don't know if its the same for human cardiology, but the number in ours just an indicator of volume; 1 is pretty much inaudible and 6 is you hear it without putting the scope on the chest, as well as having a thrill)holosystolic murmur with a PMI at the most anteromedial aspect of right second intercostal space. Knowing very little about human cardiac anatomy or physiology, I had to google where to listen on the chest to hear and assess valvular health and detect / not detect sounds. Once I had the diagram, I have a very serviceable, new and recently serviced, Littman Cardiology IV that I use daily for my own job. I feel that I am well above average in detecting low - grade, often previously unnoted murmursin dogs and cats. But I have no proficiency or point to which I can compare my ability in people to hear the same. All I can tell you is that I believe, based on point of location and time in the cardiac cycle, the murmur PMI, if truly present and not a drug induced imagination, was most likely associated with the opening of the right AV valve. Once again, having limited knowledge of human medicine, I had to look up some possible differentials for newly discovered murmurs associated with this valve. I came up with very little, finding it to be the most uncommon valve to produce murmurs, or flow issues, in adults.  I have a host of wild theories and possible causes for this murmur, but the most simple thing is usually the answer in my experience. In this case, I have to imagine it was induced by the drug by one of several different mechanisms, since I was not longer able to hear it approximately three hours after I had last used drug 11. When I was still able to hear it, the other more euphoric effects were also still largely present, and seem to come down at similar rate at which they rose. The murmur was also slightly louder with a PMI spanning further right laterally on deep inspiration. No difference could be appreciated on expiration. The tachycardia was also gone (92 BPM) by three hours after the last administration of the initial solution I made up.  I know this has been very long, and probably going in circles for a bit now - all a result of 11, which I am sure as a physician you likely deduced long ago. But here's my sum-up and question, and my reason for wanting to do so: I would like to experience some sexual arousal and see if this drug has the potential to enhance sexual experience. Failure to achieve an erection despite visual and tactile stimulation by myself and/or my girlfriend was the ultimate result. Drug 11 caused sexual excitement and desire, which obviously sucked big time in the face of temporary ED. In truth, we didn't try for too long because I knew after a couple of minutes that it simply wasn't going to happen. In addition to it feeling somewhat physiologically impossible at the time, I think I was more interested in documenting the reasons for it in my experience report. I realize that sexual side effects are usually associated with drugs effecting serotonin release, making all those anti-depressant drugs all so popular. I am theorizing that their could be low level serotonergic reuptake inhibition associated with 11, just enough to cause the unpleasant sexual side effects. So here it comes...as a result of the ED, I have been toying with taking a low oral dose of sildenafil in order to try and retake control of my ability to become aroused. I have the generic tablets in the house for treatment of pulmonary hypertension in dogs. I don't know if this will help me reach orgasm (I might find that's an entirely separate problem), but I would like to at least be able to try and say I failed. I also felt that I needed to take into effect that sildenafil having its own noradrenergic effects might have the possibility to potentiate or synergize any activity being caused by the drug 11. I read in a research paper that PDE5 inhibitors have an effect on noradrenergic nerve fibers, though the MoA was getting to be a little technical for me, even on a good day. I wasn't really sure if the MoA affecting noradrenaline release in a PDE5 I would have any effect on any drugs that are presumably noradrenergic in their effect on the brain. From what I could make of the MoA, it sounded like the noradrenergic nerve fibers of the penis were the only thing it was really directly affection. Since you are a physician reading this and can't possibly advise me to take a drug that has a tachycardic (without knowing more about why it is occurring to a certain degree of assurance), I already know you are going to recommend not to take the Sildenafil, or anything like it given my cardiovascular response. I guess what I am more interested in hearing from you is, if I plan to ignore your advise on using it in conjunction with 11, what are my chances for a reaction that is going to result in a clinically (and therefore, potentially dangerous, and cardiotoxic interaction) significant tachycardia? Given that there have been no auscultated arrhythmias, is their still a potential for the two drugs together, if working by certain MoAs, will result in one that just required some additional synergy to jumpstart things? Without knowing the MoA, in general, how common are tachyarrhythmias seen with adverse drug interactions? What type would you expect if my suspicions are close to correct about the pharmacodynamics of this structure?  I don't need exact science here or true stats since I haven't provided you with experimental data or chemical information with which you would need to form such an answer. All in all, my main and most important question is, how good of a chance of there being any sort of clinically negative side effect if I stick with a dose of Sildenafil, 20 mg or less? I definitely have not even been considering taking a large, Viagra-sized dose. I have taken 20-30mg previously alone when I had to wear a condom while having sex, causing me to have weak, or nonexistent function. It worked extremely quickly and effectively at that time.  I am going to stop talking now, if you got all the down here and read everything all the way through, I am proud of you. I know I will get an from someone that truly cares, then.",

Sexual Health & STDs,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/36060/std-help,STD Help,"Alright so here’s my story. About 18 months ago I noticed that my left ball was getting extremely red and some of the skin was starting to peel and become scaly in appearance. At about the same time I also noticed a small, pink bump that appeared on my ballsack, closish to the base of my penis. The bump was perfectly round, slightly raised, pink in color and smooth to the touch. I went to the nurse practitioner at my university (general medicine) for these issues and she diagnosed me with jock itch for my ball and genital warts. I was somewhat confused by the diagnosis of genital warts (years earlier I had gotten a HPV vaccine and I always use condoms during sex) and she admitted that she was somewhat unsure but that was what she believed it to be. Another complicating factor is that I was diagnosed with a medium sized varicocele in my left testicle at the age of 12. I was given aldara cream for the wart and lotramin for the jock itch. After 3 weeks of regimented application, neither condition changed. I went back to the same woman and she decided to treat my ball as a yeast infection and prescribed me medication accordingly (can’t remember what it was). For my pink bump they decided to freeze it off and LIBERALLY applied the cryotherapy. Another three weeks went by and my “wart” was gone and my ball had improved but still maintained a reddish color distinct from the pinkish color of my right testicle. During this time I also received a general STD test and all results were negative. 	Several months later I went to a urologist back at home who I had been going to for years. I explained the situation and he was convinced that it was NOT a genital wart. He was unsurprised by the diagnosis due to the fact that I was seen on a college campus which are apparently always more likely to diagnosis STDs to air on the side of caution. With regards to my ballsack problem he suggested that it was due to my extremely sensitive skin and recommended that I alter my bathroom routine and use soaps that were softer on the skin. I took his advice, and while my condition was temporarily relieved I still suffer constant irritation of my pubic region, almost EXCLUSIVELY in the area of my left testicle. To this day the testicle is still redder than my right. The vast majority of the time I experience general purpose itching that extends from my left ball up through the pubic hair region. Rarely, I also experience precise pain and irritation, however, it is ALWAYS located in the exact location where the cryotherapy was applied. The condition seems to worsen in hot, humid temperatures, after sex and after sitting for long periods of time. In the last 18 months, I have never noticed ANY irregular bumps or rashes and I check twice or more daily. I get relief when I slather the region in Eucerin cream twice daily (my current routine).  	My personal theory is that the irritation is due in large part to a combination of my sensitive skin, medium sized vericocele, and life in a hot, humid climate (south texas) as well as an active lifestyle that results in a lot of friction in the region. I have always been somewhat of a neurotic person but for the first time in my entire life I now have a girlfriend (great timing I know) and I don’t want to put her at risk for anything. Due to my current circumstances, seeking out the help of a professional isn’t my number 1 choice but I would do it if I absolutely had to.

However I have made two mistakes over the past few years, both including the consumption of alcohol and too much of it at that. The latest instance was possibly the worst, I had unprotected vaginal/oral/anal sex with a guy who I know (who is not my regular partner.) He has told me he is clean and does not have any STI's or STD's however I'm aware of at least one sexual partner in his past who had told me they had genital warts. Although the guy says he is clean and I am inclined to believe him I'm still wondering what are my chances of contracting something other than a urine infection which is something I'm on antibiotics for currently because of this occurrence??? I intend to go to my local sexual health clinic some time next week as it only happened Saturday, just gone, and I don't believe there would be any point or symptoms would not show just days after. I am currently suffering from a UTI which is being treated and I am experiencing constipation too, which from my understanding is a common cause from anal sex. We were both very intoxicated and we had gone back and forth from vaginal, to anal and oral sex and I know that is not ideal but that is what happened, can anybody tell me the likelihood of contracting anything from this experience?

The nurse practitioner in my Dr's office calls me and tells me Metro. and Clond. have a bad interaction together and I must ween off the metropolol because it has been causing my BP to go higher instead of lower.  In the last 2 months my DR has increased BOTH meds.  How much damage have I done? Why did my Dr prescribe these two together? How come no one caught this for over a year?

It is soft to the touch and not discolored. I can only see it in certain lighting but recently within the past month I have noticed it is pulsing with my heartbeat. I have felt my facial artery and followed it from the mandible and it feels larger on my left than on my right. I have gone to the dermatologist and they said they had never seen anything like that before. I then went to an oral surgeon who suggested I go and get an angiogram CT for the possibility it is a facial AVM. I have been worried about that possibility non stop and I wanted to post this because I have seen other people online post about similar pulsating bumps under the skin about the size of a pea near their mouths and I wanted to start this new thread because all the old ones were closed and didn’t allow me to post or comment. I was wondering if anyone has had a similar situation and if it was an AVM or if it was just that their facial artery was large and close to the surface in a particular area. I am a male and 21 years old so for it to be a facial AVM I feel that I would be diagnosed pretty late considering most AVM’s are formed around birth. I am looking to see if anyone could offer another possible theory on what it is and/or find people with the same condition so I can let you know what the results of my CT angiogram says because no one seems to know what is going on with this pulsing in my face. I am getting the CT next Friday so I will come back and post my results but in the meantime if anyone thinks they might have an alternate hypothesis please let me know and if you have this same issue, what did you find out.",

I'm a 63 yr old male, and started hypertension about a decade ago. Took Lisinopril, which knocked my systolic down from the 160s to the 140s for awhile. Recently, even with Lisinopril, was spiking close to 200. New Dr. added HCTZ (diuretic) which got it back under 150, but the 2 together make me ongoingly fatigued, and dizzy upon standing up. The new doc, nor anyone else, knows why I have such high BP. I'm underweight, not overweight, never drink or smoke, eat mostly grain, veggies and a little fish with low salt, hike in the hills regularly, semi-retired, low stress life with daily meditation, definitely don't fit the profile for hypertension. Go figure rolleyes Anyway, I've recently read about studies that show a few disconcerting conclusions about BP meds, such as: - they frequently don't work, even with 3 combined meds (ACE, Calcium Chain + diuretic) - they work for awhile but then stop, and reconfiguring meds/doses doesn't help much - some studies have shown they actually increase, rather than decrease, rate of heart-attack/strokes in takers, as a side effect, even if the numbers seem to go down - other studies show the rate of heart attack/stroke in people who ran high numbers for any length of time, then successfully brought the numbers down with the meds, had just as many heart attacks/strokes as those who never brought their numbers down, indicating that once the vascular damage is done, even if meds successfully lower your numbers from that point on, it makes little difference to the damaged veins, heart and organs Obviously, if any of those points are accurate, the BP drug-makers don't want you to know, so some of these studies seem hard to locate, but I've seen 'em So I'm interested in the latest accurate info about these points, from people who really know.

The problem does keep recurring however. A week ago I noticed blood in my semen. I considered this as a sign that there really was something significantly wrong, so I had an STI check done.

Help!!,"I’m very new here, and have searched and found similar threads, but nothing exactly what I’m going through, so I apologize if this has been asked before. For the past few years I’ve been suffering from chronic constipation, sometimes only going once every one to two weeks. When I do go it will be (sorry to be graphic) very large and rock hard. Sometimes they will be like balls, like each meal I ate is separate from another. Sometimes they would create little tears which I would see streaks of blood on the toilet paper. However it’s now very different and I’m very scared. I have been drinking Metamucil and taking a stool softener daily. For about a week I did this with nothing b happening, but today I did go. It was not all of what is backed up but a good start. However when I wiped there was a decent amount of blood, much more than ever before. I did not feel any pain or tearing so I don’t think that was it. Then, about 10-15 minutes later I felt a little like I needed to go again and when I did it felt like a little bit of the runs but when I looked it was just a glob of blood. This has happened twice, same leadup- a week of softeners and Metamucil then after a week I would go, then a glob of blood. It’s not dark or blackish, but bright red. Now I’m very nervous! I have never had issues like this before and I think it was originally partly caused by my job- I went from a job on my feet to a job at a desk, so I’m much less active, and I also would frequently have to hold it because the bathrooms at work were always out of order, and by the time I got to a bathroom I couldn’t go anymore, sometimes for a few days. I’m thinking doing that over and over may have contributed to my chronic constipation, but I’m very concerned about the blood. It isn’t from a tear or fissure on the outside from passing something hard, because I will feel like I have to go a little and a glob of blood will come out. The last time this happened it wasn’t hard at all when I went to the bathroom. The blood will sink in the toilet and stay together, it wasn’t affected by the water and there would also be blood on the toilet paper. What are some things that would cause this, and is there anything that can help? I’m very hesitant to try laxitives because the times I’ve tried (on a Friday, no work that weekend) it ended up not working until Tues/Wed. at work! It took 2 doses 2 days in a row and I still didn’t go for 4 days and I can’t get caught in the broken bathrooms at work! Thank you in advance for your help!

I’m 19 years old and am very active I’ve played sports all my life. Back then when I first started feeling these discomforts I would worry but it went away after about 5 Min so then I would be back to normal. Okay so here is what happens... at rest my heart rate is 53 bpm... which is low for my age... but when I exercise or run for instance out of no where with no warning I will get an immediate shock of a rapid heart beat. The feeling is unbearable and I immediately have to stop or else I get the feeling that I will pass out. It feels like my chest is going to explode and even when stopped and taking deep breaths it beats rapidly. I am not tired from the exercise but it drains me at that time that the incident occurs. Now what really scares me is when the heart beat will almost feel like it revives itself and in 1 second goes back to normal. That’s how quick it goes back on normal beats. I feel it through my whole body when it happens. This problem is very hard to explain so this was the best I could. I had an irregular heartbeat as a child but I’ve received EKG in the past and there were no problems... what is happening?

The pains are either in the center or the left side of my chest, beneath my rib cage. I feel constant pressure, and it's difficult to breathe deeply. It hurts even worse when I lay flat on my back or on my right side, but it's difficult to get comfortable at all, honestly. I have shortness of breath, and I get dizzy/ light headed sometimes. The pain shoots down my left arm. My left arm was numb and tingling for a few hours on Wednesday, and there were sharp pains in my left hand and fingers, as well as numbness. Today, I feel the pain in my back, as well. Yesterday, I had a nuclear stress test. The pain increased AFTER my heart rate was supposed to drop. Therefore, my heart rate didn't slow down, and my BP was elevated. They had to inject me with something to slow my heart rate; it still took several minutes to get it below 100 bpm. After I left, the vessels on either side of my neck were throbbing and bulging and my neck hurt so badly, I thought I was going to have a stroke. I feel like the cardiologist is being dismissive because I don't smoke, I'm not obese, nor do I have hypertension or high cholesterol. However, I'm a type-A personality, and I have a high stress job (middle school English teacher). I've always been high-strung, and I have a history of anxiety dating back to childhood. I also suffer from Raynaud's and migraines. Since the chest pains started, I've noticed an increase in how often my left hand is blue (2-3 times per day, versus only when I was cold or stressed before, and it would happen in both hands and my feet) and I've had severe headaches almost every day. I have never posted on a discussion forum, but I'm so tired of feeling like this doctor isn't taking me seriously. He's got it in his mind that it's not my heart, and he's acting like he's just indulging me by ordering further tests. The EKG and echocardiogram were both normal, but I wasn't having a spasm during either test. Also, he hasn't checked my vessels, which is where I think the issue lies. Meanwhile, I had to take a leave of absence from work because I can no longer perform my job well! I thought it was weird that I would get through the whole day and then be hunched over in pain when I finally sat down for planning during the last block, as well. Although there were moments when I had to step outside of the class because I felt like I was having a minor heart attack, I had a MAJOR incident one night after playing with my dog. I ended up curled in a ball on the floor, clutching my chest. It's a shame when I don't want to go to the ER because I'm worried they're just going to send me home and tell me, ""It's not your heart."" What else could it possibly be???

I feel very gassy when these attacks happen and sometimes if I get in the right position I can open my mouth and not burp but instead it’s almost as if air is escaping. It makes a gurgle sound. I can do this for 30 minutes sometimes. Sometimes this alleviates the attack, other times not.  I don’t know what other info to give. I’d just like help. My doctors act like nothings wrong and just brush it off, but it scares me to death. I don’t want to die and leave my wife and two kids behind. I don’t know if the one time I don’t go to the ER is going to be the one time I should have. I just want peace... can ANYONE help?",

I appreciate this isn't directly related to a heart attack, but I'm worried about one.  Bit of background, I'm 21, male, I'm not overweight but I'm not particularly fit and my blood pressure is slightly raised at 135/90. I do have a family history of coronary heart disease on both sides.  18 months ago, I was taken into A&E with discomfort in my chest, a sort of pressure with an occasional shooting pain, my ECG was apparently ever so slightly 'abnormal, bloods showed slightly raised protein levels, I was diagnosed with pericarditis (hmm) and sent home to rest. Nothing changed. To try and cut a long story short, ever since then my life has been a living hell and the pain has gotten worse, more frequent and more widespread. Now, I get a crushing pain in my left chest with the occasional stabbing pain, I get numbness in my jaw, and I get this awful ache in my left arm only. Also get quite heavy palpitations Exercise definitely triggers the pain and palpitations. over the last 18 months, I've seen several family doctors and one cardiologist. I've had 8 ECGs, one abnormal, seven normal, I've had several blood tests, one abnormal, the rest normal, I've had an echocardiogram which was normal, an ECG stress test which was normal, and a CT angiogram scan which was normal, cardiology discharged me a few months ago. Unfortunately I've now been branded with the anxiety label by numerous doctors, I now can't see anyone without being asked ""so do you think this is being caused by your anxiety?"", I've never had a history of anxiety or depression or anything like that. im at my wits end, and could just really use some advice.

Heart Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/6583/chest-discomfort,chest discomfort,"Back in September 2016 I started having what felt like swelling in my mouth and tongue pain and well as a feeling that I was choking. No one could find anything wrong. I went to multiple ENT, MRI nothing. In January I had an upper endoscopy. I had eosinophilic esophagitis, gerd, small hiatal hernia and multiple erosions in the stomach that were bleeding. Never had stomach pain go figure. I was on omeprazole for about 8 days then I stopped it. I had a VERY hard pound in my chest. No idea what it was but nothing happened after. It did it again the next day and nothing. The third and last time it did it I started getting skipped heart beats after. The first few days I had likely a thousand a day. As time went on they got less and less now I maybe have 5 to 10 a day. I used to get palpitations from proton pump inhibits in the past so I try to not take them.  Anyway the first day I had them I saw a cardiologist. He gave me low dose atenolol. I took it at night and when I woke up in the morning all my chest muscles and neck muscles were very stiff in the morning. As the day went on it got better. Then over the next week or so I started getting pain in my left shoulder that shot down my arm and the left side of my chest. The more I did the worse it would get. Finally one day it was terrible I called an ambulance. They did an EKG when they arrived and said it looked good. They gave me nitro and took me to the ER. They did blood work and said I was fine. This continued on and off and then I started getting pain the center of the chest low just below the sternum. During this time I started getting severe anxiety as I started thinking I was going to die any second every day. As time went on I started getting this chest discomfort right in the center of the chest. Originally I only got the pain after a painful skipped beat. Most were fine but now and then I’d get one that felt sharp and then I’d get chest pain after. Now I just get the pain all the time palpitation or no. When I have this discomfort if I go somewhere i get extreme tightness along my entire ribcage, front, back and sides. Like someone giving me a bear hug. Sometime it feels tight down my arms and into my jaw as well. I have this every day and the discomfort almost all day. I even wake up with it. To date I have had 12 EKG’s all normal.   As one doctor put it most people would wish their EKG looked that good. I have had a lot of blood work all normal. I had an echo, halter, stress test, and nuclear stress test all normal. The only thing they see is on the halter I get bouts of tachycardia and an occasional PAC. The cardiologist says that it looks like something is irritating the heart but he doesn’t think it’s the heart. The GI doctor says my esophagus is not the problem he said take antacids which I have tried many no help. I do not know what to do. My primary, rheumatologist and cardiologist all tell me see a shrink its anxiety/panic attacks. How can this be almost all day every day? To give an example I went to my wife’s parent’s house one day and I started getting the discomfort and shaking.   I tried walking it off but little to no help. They asked me to help move some light chairs outside all of 10 feet. I was fine during but about 5 to 10 minutes after I got the bear hug chest tightness and started panicking badly thinking I was going to die. I tried to relax to no avail. This continued till I got home and relaxed and it went away. The next day I went outside my house determined to figure this out and I started cleaning up my yard movie 35 to 50 pound blocks and other things for about 25 minutes. No pain no tightness no problems. Next morning I woke up and chest was tight but I did do heavy lifting and it didn’t feel deep. But I was home and relaxed. Other things I have noticed is I don’t care about sex as much as I did before this and I feel worn out very often. The chest discomfort feels like it’s about an inch deep right under the sternum and makes activity tiresome. I also concentrate on my heart all day.  Nothing else really runs through my head since I always feel it I can’t concentrate on anything else but solving this. I have been to the ER 3 times they said it’s likely costocondritis but I try nsaids and nothing plus it has been going on for 3 months or so now ever since that hard POUND or whatever that was. Is there a way I have a blockage and all of those tests missed it? Or am I really going insane?   Some extra notes about me. I am male, 34 and married with a 1 year old daughter. In my entire family tree only my father had heart problems. He had a heart attack at 57 but he also smoked for many years was very overweight 300 pounds or so and was a type 2 diabetic for at least 15 years. He did survive the heart attack and is fine now at 66.I have never smoked in my life. I do not drink. I was always very skinny and healthy but about 2 years ago I started gaining some weight. I am 6’3” and topped out at about 233 in December 2016. Now in April I am 220. I normally eat healthy LOTS of fruits and veggies. The occasional french-fry etc.  Since I developed a wheat allergy a few years back I try to eat gluten free as best I can but it can be hard. I take zyrtec every day since I developed the wheat allergy else I get hives all over head to toe even if I stay gluten free.   I’m not the most active person in the world since I do IT work and I’m on computers a lot but I do get out. A lot in summers. Winters here in NJ get cold. I do have ehlers danlos syndrome a connective tissue disorder but that has never affected my chest before just spine and knees/shoulders. I did have an mra in May of 2016 that saw no aneurysms in my chest. They look now and then even though I do NOT have the type that affects arteries. I just wait all day expecting to have a heart attack. I even shake my legs all day which I’m told is anxiety. I have tried Xanax but all it does is make me tired nothing else. Please help me. This is ruining my life I can not even leave the house anymore as the chest will get very tight and full panic will set in and this is not getting better just worse as time goes on.",

First of Heart Surgery recovery is not fun. Which you can read more about on my blog.  Once you begin recovery, I can not emphasize this enough. Take your medicine and Stay Active. Even if is just doing laps around your house. The more active you are, the quicker and easier recovery will be.  Heart surgery recovery is a daily process that you should never stop doing.  I can't afford a gym or anything like that. So I took what I learned in cardiac rehab and made up my own routine with the hopes it will help others.  It's ok to start off setting small goals for yourself. Don't rush things. This isn't a race.  then with each day of your recovery, push yourself each day until you get to where you know you want to be, as far as endurance goes. Since my heart attack I've made one of my missions to help those who are going through the same thing.

The head of the penis itself, though looked a bit red before (and the area around the tip can look like a patch of dry skin), feels completely fine, while the foreskin is distinctly redder, irritated and seems dry. Also there is periodic mild burning sensation when I urinate that seems to occur at random.  I had unprotected sex in early July and have since had an STI screening for everything except herpes, which my doctor tells me would have become obvious long ago. A second doctor told me it looked like I had balanitis, to which I was given a mild, over the counter cream that alleviated the feelings for a week.  Ever since then, which was well over a month ago, I have still had persistent feeling of on and off irritation. It often feels like the veins in my penis itself are irritated or even swollen, especially one vein on the right of the shaft that loops around the top of my foreskin, goes down the right side of my penis shaft and down a little to my leg, which often feels irritated when I wear certain clothes, like suit pants. I should mention I have sebopsiorasis as well, which leads my regular doctor to tell me to avoid anything with yeast (which I have been lazy about for a long time), but I have no idea if it is related.  It is honestly not debilitating, nor does it come with any other symptoms (say, fever or whatever) nor stop me from being able to have sex or masturbate, though when I do either in excess the vein on the right shaft of my penis get swollen and irritated. But it is persistent and annoying presence, and makes me wonder if balanitis can even exist for this long or is it a sign of something worse.

When my stool is not hard enough I can’t pass all of it out. Some of it remains in my rectum since I’m partially incontinent. The cause is Cauda equina syndrome. This syndrome started after a tumor was removed from my spinal cord in the L1/L2 area in 2002. My gastro intestinal doctor prescribed Loperamide (Imodium AD), 8MG a day. When the Loperamide was prescribed it hardened my stool so all of it is passed out completely. This medication worked great for 14 years but now has not been working at all. If I don’t use my finger or another method to clean and remove the loose stool, the remaining the stool will slowly come out and soil my underwear to a point where some people may smell it. I would like to know what options I have to remove the loose leftover stool. I’ve tried the following: 1. My finger – This takes time and I can never get my rectum 100% clean. 2. Enema squeeze bottle. These don’t work well for me because of weakness in my hands combined with my incontinence. The water can start coming out before I want it to. When they do work they do a great job but these are not an option for me. If someone is looking at this post and would like to see what I’m talking about go to this link  ;psc=1  3. Enema. I purchased a full enema kit. The issue I have here is the water will start coming out before I want it to and the nozzle does not always stay in because of my incontinence. My rectum can’t grasp the nozzle correctly. When the enema does work it does a good job. I did find an enema tip that was larger, it did help me hold on to it better. Here’s what I purchased:  ;ie=UTF8&qid=1483666161&sr=1-3&keywords=enema+nozzle+tips  4. Fingernail cleaning brush. I’ve been using a fingernail cleaning brush to remove the leftover loose stool currently. I put soap where I’m going to stick it in, insert it and turn it around in a circular motion and then remove it. This does a great job to remove the leftover stool but after using it until the stool is gone there will be some blood on the brush. This worries me. For example getting an infection where a small cut or scrape is. My questions are has anyone out there found another way to remove the stool that is leftover besides a finger or enema? Is there a medical handheld device that will allow me to remove the stool like the fingernail brush but safer? Also just a side question. I don’t know how I created an account with the Screen Name “bowel” Is there a way to change this? Thanks Everyone, Dana","IBD , Crohn's Disease , Irritable Bowel Syndrome"

A few weeks ago, I was suffering from bad swollen tonsils, bad sore throat, small fever, and chills (Chills were accompanied with smaller veins on my hands and feet; smaller than usual). I tested negative for strep and negative for mono, but my primary doctor suggested that I had CMV. My blood pressure was a little higher than usual, but my doctor did not see it as a problem (I am in the average range for vitamin/blood levels; overall, very healthy). He told me if the majority of the symptoms didnt show any improvement within 4 days, that I should come back for more blood work. He didn't seem worried about how my hand veins were appearing smaller during parts of the day, also. Luckily, the tonsils/throat/fever all improved within the next week and I am feeling much better now. But, throughout the day, I notice my hands and feet get cold, and I notice the veins that are usually big on my hands, shrink; this is sometimes accompanied with red cheeks.

I do not show any other symptoms of blood clots (no fatigue, redness, numbness, etc) but I just wanted to ask somebody. If I do have CMV, I read that it can stay in your system for weeks and even months. If I did have it, could these symptoms I'm experiencing stay with me until the Virus subsides?

The only time a doctor departed from this norm was when he asked me to take off my bra and jeans and get on a bike like that. It made me feel uncomfortable, so I asked if I could keep my bra on. He said, no because of the EKG leads. But this was never an issue in the past. I did as he said, because I was doing poorly and wanted to get the test over with and rest. I noticed him looking at my chest area, which again is a departure from what I was normally used to (doctors monitoring the data on their screens and looking at my face when making conversation). It made me very uncomfortable that he was staring at me without saying anything, as my upper body was unclothed. I never went back to him, or reported him.

Sorry for the long post, just wanna be thorough. 24 yo male here. About a month ago, after a particularly sexually active night, both my gf and I experienced moderate pain in our genitals. Her vagina appeared slightly redder than normal and the skin under my penis' head became very sensitive and had a lot of tiny red dots that looked like developing pimples. All of our symptoms disappeared after ~4-5 days, but we stopped having sex just in case. She then went to a doctor and was diagnosed with HPV. The doctor found a few warts pop up in her genital area (but thankfully at least no carcinogenic strains showed up on the test). We had our first intimate contact this summer and first unprotected sex in September. Not sure who infected who (both had few previous partners), but after a close inspection I started wondering if a couple of barely noticeable bumps I had under my foreskin for several years are actually warts. They're colorless, elevate roughly 0.5 mm above the surrounding skin, and don't seem to have changed in appearance since I got them 3-4 years ago. When I first noticed them back then, I decided it was just slight scarring from penetrating a stiff/poorly lubricated vagina, but now I noticed that these growths look kinda round-ish, almost like small oval seeds embedded under the skin. To add insult to injury, a couple of days ago my penis started giving off a heavy, unpleasant odor. It is gone immediately after showering, but reappears in a few hours. 1. Can the bumps on the photos be warts? 2. If so, can the smell be related? Why would it only appear now (we hadn't had sex since the incident a month ago, btw) and is there anything I can try to do about it? 3. Is there any reason to not have unprotected sex now that we're both infected anyway (other than risk of pregnancy, that is)? 4. Finally, I've seen a LOT of conflicting info on whether HPV can be completely cleared from the body. As of 2017, would is the consensus? If it is possible, what are the steps to increase our chances?

My aunties were too shocked to even process the sudden death so an autopsy was not revealed. Although, I am still wondering what may be the cause of his death...

Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/75137/diarrhea-turned-chronic,Diarrhea Turned Chronic,"I was diagnosed with IBS quite some time ago. My gastro tests were normal. This was about two years ago. I had occasional bouts with painful cramps and diarrhea and sometimes constipation but I was able to lead a fairly normal life and could make plans to go with confidence. I merely made sure to scout out where the rest room was when I got there--just in case.  Nearly a month ago my diarrhea episodes suddenly turned daily. The worst aspect is that it doesn't all come out at once but in several bouts over a couple of hours and even longer. In other words, I have no idea when I am done now and can no longer go out. The stools usually start out fairly solid but still have that diarrhea smell. They end up very watery. I decided to add more bran to my diet and it seemed to help briefly. My stools were entirely solid and well-formed and they passed without cramping. I thought I had cured my chronic diarrhea until I happened to run out of the raisin and oat clusters cereal I was eating. That was just prior to Thanksgiving day. I was invited to the home of a relative and consumed nothing all morning so I would not be bloated and could eat. Regardless, I took very small portions of a few things as I know I can no longer consume a large meal. I felt fine until I got up to go home after a couple of hours. Walking the very short distance to my car, I felt I couldn't catch my breath--the absolute worst episode of this I ever experienced. I struggled to breath all the way home and, luckily, it wasn't far. After lying down at home, I felt better--but like something was stuck, my entire small meal, that wasn't being digested. It persisted during the night and so I took some Miralax. The next day resulted in terrible and painful bouts of diarrhea but some relief at last. As soon as I could, I bought some more bran cereal and have been eating that for the past few days. Nothing good has come of it. Just stuck at home with diarrhea and uncomfortable bloating. Hardly dare to eat anything else. Today is Sunday and I know I should phone my gastro doc tomorrow--but wonder if I can even keep an appointment as I am so incontinent.

Can I start this by saying that I'm unbelievably concerned and stressed out about the possibility of contracting a very serious STD like HIV or other life-long, life-threatening ones (any in general). I'll make this as short and precise as possible. Honesty is key in providing you with as much information as possible for an accurate diagnosis or opinion (I hope). I was in a really bad state of mind emotionally on Sunday night (72 hours ago) and just made a terrible decision to see a prostitute to take my mind off things. I was still very concerned about the encounter and asked ahead of time (for what it was worth) if she had any std's at all. She said that she was a healthcare worker (worked at an obgyn) and that she didn't and was tested 3 months back and was cleared. It was at her place in a lower income area. We both agreed that a condom must be used at ALL TIMES. She gave me oral for maybe 3-4 minutes and then we had vaginal intercourse for 5-7 tops after that. We both noticed that the condom broke when I pulled out. I wasn't into it and just wanted to leave, so I didn't ejaculate. I think I felt it break when I reinsertwd myself in about 2-3 minutes prior to stopping. We both talked about how we were clean and shouldn't worry and I left, completely worrying because of the situation. Obviously I can't trust her one bit and was more concerned than she was.  I'm a 30yo circumcised, healthy white male. She was Hispanic, maybe mid-40's. The next morning I had a very mild burning sensation in my urethra that has persisted through today (Mon morning through Wed evening).

Still Looking for a ""Cure""","Hi Everyone,  I've been experiencing very low libido for 3 years now. I remember the exact month my libido went away--August 2014. I was going through some stressful things in my personal life and just lost any desire for sex. Previous to that, I considered myself to have quite a high sex drive (especially compared to how I feel now). I'd always been curious about sex from an early age and had a healthy sex life from the age of 22.  A few things happened in 2014 or near that time that might be responsible. I went on birth control for a month. (I hated it so could only stand it for a month--the side effects were too much for me). I also went on Lexapro in early January 2015 until September 2015 or so. During that time, I had ZERO sex drive and was physically unable to orgasm. After going off, my sex drive never really seemed to come back completely. In 2014-2015 I also began a cycle of dieting / working out very hard at times, specifically weightlifting. I still lift weights and feel that might be possibly to blame at times? I have no idea. I also began having difficulty coming to terms with the possibility of having children and that was affecting me psychologically / physically. (I've since decided it's not for me).  At this point, my husband and I are both frustrated with my lack of interest. It really has damaged our relationship, especially from his side. I've talked with my lady Dr. about this, have had blood work specifically to check hormone levels / thyroid (twice now, the only abnormal thing was low vitamin D which I've since remedied), tried counseling (with no success) and tried just forcing myself, but I just can't seem to get back those feelings I used to have.

Hello all, I'm a 21 year old. Gender: male as you may have assumed. About a year ago I tried jelqing, a natural ""penis enlargement"" technique where you try to push blood flow into your penis and trap it there supposedly making it larger over time. In reality, I think it creates scar tissue which in a way does make your penis slightly bigger over time but of course is very damaging. After the last session, I had an ache in my shaft for some days. I quit cold turkey after that.  I noticed a pretty significant loss of sensitivity but ignorantly figured it would just heal itself and regularly masturbated the next couple months. I noticed it took much longer than usual to ejaculate and harder to hold onto an erection. I had lost a significant amount of sensitivity and was having to heavily rub my foreskin to make anything happen. I started getting to a point where I had to wait a week between masturbation to successfully make myself climax. I know it was idiotic to continue this but at the time, I stupidly stayed optimistic and figured things would magically heal themselves. As a guy that always had a sub-average sized penis, I constantly got erections whether it was because I had to pee, my penis rubbed slightly the wrong way on my shorts, something pushed against it, etc would cause me a never ending erection to the point where I usually had some daily discomfort in my shaft from constant stimulation. I decided to believe that maybe this new lack of erections was a step in the more normal direction. After some months, I noticed even more sensitivity loss and quit masturbating completely. Its been about 5 months since I last masturbated. I've seen 4 different doctors (2 being urologists) and no answers. Symptoms: White spots on foreskin, less noticeable when erect b/c blood flow. A lot of spider veins. Entire shaft has almost no sexual sensitivity in it; the feeling of rubbing it can be compared to rubbing your finger; I feel it but no pleasing feelings/sensation. I sometimes get dull pain at the base of my penis, between the base and my pelvic floor only on the left side when I use the muscle for pushing out pee/poop. When I masturbated often after the injury I noticed pain in this spot except much sharper when I achieved hard erections and would pull my penis to my stomach to relieve it. The belly of my shaft, only on the half closer to the glands is my most sensitive area since the injury and seemed to be the least effected spot. I do still achieve erections while sleeping so I don't think it's a vascular issue. If there's anyone that has experienced something similar, any advice is greatly appreciated.

My 15 year old son has been going to a gastro Dr at Childrens for five years. They did not come out and say he had reflux. They said the scope looks good. They think it’s just anxiety. Problem is, my kids stomach hurts so badly all the time, that he can not eat before 1 pm or after 6 pm!!! His only Med is ranitidine 309 mg. It does help the pains. My question is two part: 1) is there anything to get completely rid of it? And 2) his breath does NOT smell sour, like most reflux patients. It smells like MOTHBALLS. I am a RDH, so he has excellent oral home care. So what is causing this odor like mothballs??? Please help?!!!","GERD and Heartburn , Crohn's Disease , Ulcers , Ulcerative Colitis"

Two days after the encounter I noticed a bump on the area of the scrotum near the base of my penis.

I don't feel anything directly on my penis though. The burning sensation has continued.  I saw a doctor earlier today and he said that the bump was an ingrown hair and that I had no visual signs of herpes. He also ordered a urine test for gonorrhea and chlamydia. When I asked about the burning sensation he said it could be from gonorrhea, chlamydia, or something other than an std. How common is it for burning on the skin be caused by these? I have no discomfort when urinating and have noticed nothing else out of the ordinary. How often does herpes result in burning without any blisters or lesions?

My left chest has been hurting for the past 8 months or so. It's hard to describe, but it's a relatively numb pain with intensity that ebbs and tides yet is fairly consistent in it's presence. It sometimes becomes a bit sharp and extends to my back/shoulder. I also experience  shortness of breath and cannot run or exercise intensely any longer, which is disappointing because I really enjoy running/hiking/skiing/other sports.  I can walk downhill without problems, but walking or running uphill is very difficult and causes me to become breathless.  Even walking up a flight of stairs can leave me breathless, when prior to this I was able to hike four miles up a mountain in an hour without issues.  Sometimes I have difficulty catching my breath, even without exercise. I also experience palpitations in my chest. I feel nearly every heartbeat, and I could probably determine my pulse without pressing my fingers to my body.  The pain is not affected by moving.  I feel a similar pain when I breathe in VERY deeply, but normal breathing does not change the pain.   The pain is not palpable.  Pressing or massaging the left side of my chest does not change the pain. There were three things that immediately preceded the onset of this pain, and I am not sure which is to be blamed.  The pain began a few days after I returned from a long flight across the country, during which I was in the same plane seat for 9 hours each way.  When I returned, I had a possible case of pneumonia during which I coughed heavily and constantly coughed up mucus.  I will also admit that I first smoked marijuana around this time.  I let the smoke sit in my lungs for a few seconds before exhaling, and I was coughing heavily.  I also experienced a rapid heart rate, palpitations and heavy left-side chest pain while intoxicated.  I have not smoked marijuana since. I visited the ER 7 months ago (about 10 days after onset) convinced that I was having a heart attack or something, and an EKG, bloodwork and chest x-ray all came up negative. The doc just told me that I likely wasn't experiencing an immediately life-threatening condition and to follow up with my pcp. I also recently had routine blood work done recently, and everything came back normal except for the fact that I was a bit low in B12 vitamins. I have an appointment with my pcp coming up, but I wanted to post here to get another opinion.   Thank you very much for your time.",

Heart Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/31925/concerned-about-diagnosis,Concerned about diagnosis,"Hello I appreciate any help with this. I've been having weird symptoms and feel like I'm not being properly diagnosed by my doctor. I'm in the military stationed in 29 Palms and our medical staff is notorious for misdiagnosing patients. Recently I returned from 6 months in Japan and started experiencing weird symptoms that led to a full on panic attack. I've never had a panic attack before. These symptoms appeared right after a weekend of heavy drinking where in my drunken state I forced myself to vomit multiple times. Not sure if it's related but that's the exact weekend it started. Symptoms: hard to really explain, the best I can say is a constant weird sensation in the middle of my chest. Not really pain more of just an extremely weird feeling. This is followed sometimes by a weirder feeling on the left side of my chest. I understand this is vague, but it almost just feels like a muscle twitch or movement inside if my chest. Sometimes I get shortness of breathe out of nowhere, just sitting or laying down. I also suddenly have trouble sleeping because I can feel my pulse beating in my finger tips and ears while trying to fall asleep. Not beating faster just ""harder"". I believe all this led to me having a couple anxiety/panic attacks.  So I've been to the ER after one of these attacks because I was afraid I was going to pass out alone in my room and it was 2AM. I complained of pain in my chest and shortness of breathe, they ran an EKG and a chest xray and found nothing abnormal.  The labs they ran showed nothing abnormal other than my thyroid gland pumping out more hormones than it's supposed to, I believe they said my T3 and T4 were elevated. Seeing my assigned medical officer he diagnosed me with anxiety and heartburn/GIRD. Prescribed me Zantac and Atarax.  My issue is my symptoms haven't gone away at all, I constantly feel irregular. The feeling in my chest almost never goes away and I'm honestly afraid that something more serious than heartburn is going on. The cause of the anxiety is the wierd chest sensations start making me think there's an issue with my heart, but they are telling me the chest sensations are being caused by the anxiety which I believe isn't true. I feel it at all times no matter what I'm doing.  I went from having no medical issues to all of a sudden having every aspect of my life interrupted by this and they want me to believe it's heartburn just because they listened to my chest with a stethoscope. On top of that there's a common trend here of misdiagnosis because there are a lot of fakers trying to get out of training by faking symptoms, so they tend to give you ibuprofen and send you on your way. I have no problem training I just want to feel normal again.  Any help would be highly appreciated.",

After I went to the hospital, I had 4 more panic attacks in a row in 1 hour. They were scary! I was not convinced though, because how would panic disorder create this strange feeling in my heart? I've done some research and found out that A LOT of people with panic disorders have the exact same feeling in their heart. And it was caused by excessive amount of adrenalin in the blood, causing the heart to work harder and in the end, tiring it. And, I've done lots of research about heart failure and I know that it's caused by an over-working heart. So... As a result of this adrenalin - over-working heart muscles, can I expect heart failure in the future if I don't cure my panic disorder? Everyone says panic disorder is harmless.

You should try to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day because that will definitely help and eat three or four servings of fruit because it definitely helped when I was having issues. Also the scripts the doctor gave you maybe there's just generic versions of it and if not you'll have to tell the doctor if you haven't already that you need something cheap because you can't pay for it and also ask if this other meds that you can take. Also do a Google search to see if they have coupons for the meds that you need because a lot of times for the first 6 months or whatever the drug companies will have coupons and the meds are really cheap. Also you might want to tell the doctor to write the initials script for 10 days or tell the pharmacy you only want 10 days of the script filled.

I’m 31, male, and average weight (74-78kg). For about 4 months I’ve been experiencing near constant burping as well as a range of other things: - burping - dull headaches/lightheaded ness (usually on left hand side or at the back). Sometimes can’t really stand up without feeling wobbly / like I could collapse - hot flushes - occasional stomach pain - shortness of breath (particularly just as I’m about to sleep). Sometimes effecting my sleep pattern as I can’t get to sleep easily. Usually can be relieved by burping - coughing  - infrequent weakness in left shoulder - dry heaving I can’t seem to point out what might be triggering this. I don’t drink much coffee, eat fairly healthily (I don’t eat breakfast but my lunch and dinners are generally healthy). I drink excessive water if anything - probably 3-4L per day and rarely drink soft drinks, don’t drink energy drinks at all etc. I drink alcohol on average once a week on a weekend. I am a fairly light smoker (about 5-6 per day) and I’m in the process of trying to give that up. I had a day off over the last weekend (well 23 hours anyway) and that didn’t seem to help at all. So far I’ve visited the doctors a few times and had the following: - urea breath test for h.pylori (negative) - blood test (everything good except at the time indicated I had a virus - they didn’t do anything further about this other than referring me for a follow up blood test which I’m yet to do) - stomach ultrasound (to check for gallstones - was all good) This is really starting to bug me - mainly the burping constantly at work and on the train with people noticing it and of course the light headed feeling. I’m not sure what else to do as the doctors don’t seem to know anymore or recommend anything. I’ve had a look myself online and the symptoms I have look as thought they point to a stomach ulcer / possible anaemia. I am considering trying OTC Nexium as my next step (although will be going back to the doctors this week). Has anyone else had anything like this? Or could suggest a path a take when speaking to doctor in terms of other tests etc. Appreciate any help I can get!","GERD and Heartburn , Ulcers"

Help!,"Hello all, At the beginning of this month, I had my recurring pilonidal cyst lanced for the second time and was on a course of antibiotics. Before the lancing I was on doxycycline (100 mg), and after I did a complete course of clindamycin in a stronger dose (300 mg). The abscess itself and the lancing gave me a fever and made me pretty sick. During and after the antibiotics my bowel movements changed drastically. I have been having trouble with bright red blood in my stool and when I wipe since May due to hemorrhoids. Now my hemorrhoids are terrible, and my bowel movements are mostly watery with blood and mucus. Any sort of straining back there can cause blood to come out. I went to pass gas the other day and instead ended up with a thick blood and mucus mixture. The stool itself is minimal and hardly solid. I often go several times in the morning, and often almost directly after eating. The urgency of a movement can not be ignored or else the result might be tragic. I am incredibly gassy as well, I can often hear it churning through my tummy. It seems like something has shifted somewhere in my digestive tract or things are moving through me too quickly. I don’t really have any other symptoms besides the occasional stomachache before and after going. Prior to all of this, I had normal bowel movements once or twice a day. My broke college student diet isn’t the greatest, but nothing has really changed there. I have been taking probiotics to try and regulate the bacteria in my gut and Metamucil to up my fiber intake. I even did an enema to try and flush things out but I couldn’t even hold it in for more than five minutes. I’m at a loss as to what to do. Taking care of the hemorrhoids has been difficult with this happening because it is very raw back there. Preparation H can only do so much when you’re going five times a day, and the swelling just keeps getting worse. I apologize for the length of this post, but I wanted to include as much detail as possible. If anyone could offer any tips on how I can reset my digestive system and bowel movements, that would be great. I have a standing appointment with my PCP and will see him around mid October, should I go sooner? Thanks in advance!","IBD , Irritable Bowel Syndrome , Bloating , Constipation"

Very rarely in other areas of my body, just mostly all around my legs. Very itchy. Rarely lots grouped together just kind of random, or if they are grouped it's very few like 2 or 3 near each other. They look like zits, just that they itch.  Other info that may be relevant: I do live in a cold state and I have sensitive skin/easily get dry skin in cold weather. Also was recently on an antibiotic I've never tried and I know one of the side effects can be rash (I've been off it now for a few days though and these bumps have persisted.) The stupidly anxious part about the sexual incident is that it did not last very long (~5 min) and he did not ejaculate in my mouth, so the most there would have been was pre-cum and probably not even much of that. Also, I did not have any mouth sores or bleeding (though I do have sensitive gums in general, they wouldn't have been bleeding at the time), open wounds (nor did he), nor were there any visible cuts/bumps/problems with his penis.

Ive tried taking enzymes and bile salts, which worked temporarily for about 10ish days then they stopped working, which leads us to today.

It began when all I wanted to do was go to sleep and lay down in bed. At first, if I sat or laid in a odd position, my area down there, especially in contact with the sides of my testicals, they wanted to contract immediately with discomforting feelings with those muscles that you use to control bladder or move your penis (perineum?) Was scared with shivers, almost felt like it was a spasm for about 2/3 hours with some slight pain. Couldn't decide if it was urgent to go to a hospital. Took some ibuprofen to relax myself, which calmed myself, and diminished 50% of these ""pain"" of these involuntary (or maybe voluntary) urges to tighten up down there (like if you're trying to stop or hold your bladder or moving your penis up when erect or flaccid) if I moved a certain way. I managed to relax and found several positions both laying down and sitting to ignore it, but it comes back noticeably when trying to bend down a certain way or getting up.  But in the course of four days, I've experienced: - Those urges. - Diarrhea and semi-frequent trips to the restroom.  - Stiffness/""locking"" contraction feeling down there when trying to push myself up or reach in certain ways. - Weakness to an extent (though it may be from the ibuprofen when I take it). - Walked slow to take it easy. - Triggering when something lands on my genitals hard or unexpectedly (sensitivity issue?) - One random moment after waking up in chair with an erection. - Random times where I lay in bed but can't really sleep with funny feelings down there. I had been trying to combat this by pushing out (like the feeling when you're pooping or forcing your urine) and has worked to some extent.

I am 39 years of old married with two kids. I'll begin by saying that I have testicular pain. I've been to the urologist after urologist. And they have made my life a living hell. They don't believe me. They laugh at me. It's complicated. I've been in so much pain that it has caused me to be depressed and nearly suicidal. Practically in tears. When I start having problems in my testicles, I can't sit still I am in that much pain. Then my anxiety begins to go crazy. I've tried hormone replacement like taking testosterone shots and the cream. It didn't help. I try sleeping it off. Doesn't help. Even taking a cold bath, sometimes even a hot bath. That sometimes relieves the pain. But not my much. I have trouble getting my point across, so I thought I would type it all down. I've countless sexual ""hang-ups"" and was hoping and praying that they will eventually leave. I would, however, like to clarify that whenever I view pornography I normally would masturbate to oral sex. When this occurs, it's usually once a week. I've been attempting to refrain from doing this. Too many, problems. There came a time where I would prefer masturbating than having sex. One of the problems is that I'm a lousy lover. I know I should never allow myself to feel self-conscious or inadequate in any way. When my wife and I do actually have intercourse, I struggle with keeping and maintaining my erection and by keeping stamina and hardness throughout the act. Whenever I lose my erection, I merely am discouraged and roll over and become seriously ticked off at myself, not with my wife. Because I can't stay hard enough to have sex. We've tried anal sex, it worked for a while, till all of a sudden it doesn't work anymore. Have no idea what happened. Just stopped working. Another problem I have is not getting ""satisfied"" by my wife giving me oral sex. I can't seem to get an erection. Weird, right? I am clueless. This is going to sound strange, especially coming from a male. Where men are expected to be ""sex animals"". But whenever my wife performs fellatio, I don't know how to react. I look at her. It's a very odd, and strange feeling. She has asked me once if I liked what she was doing. I couldn't answer her because I didn't know what to say. When I perform oral stimulation on my wife, I still fail to get an erection. *Sighs* Whenever I obtain an erection, and I'm really hard, it hurts like hell. Noticed the head of my penis would turn colors. The pain would start at the shaft and then move down to my testicles. My wife and I have tried reciprocal masturbation together, unfortunately, it never worked for me either. Learning to relax and eliminate distractions is something I have trouble addressing. I suppose I am size-obsessed. In my younger years, two of my ex-girlfriends would say that I had a big penis. Nonetheless, I also believed they just said that at the time, because I was with them. My wife had said I was ""big enough"" for her. Nevertheless, again, I don't think I will ever get past this. And accept me for me. My current counselor has stated that I need to learn to appreciate my body as it is. It's a task I have trouble accepting, despite my body insecurity. And she too was right, about having these sexual issues is without a doubt preventing genuine closeness between my wife and me. I am most positive.

His presentation of this disorder has been very mild in comparison to other patients but he has had one significant surgery so far and that was a Mitral Valve Replacement. About two months ago, he appeared to have contracted a stomach virus. He had the usual nausea, vomiting, fever, and stomach pain associated with the run of the mill stomach virus, along with severe dehydration and ten pounds of weight loss. His spleen was also significantly swollen, with no obvious reason. He seemingly recovered from the acute symptoms in a few days but he has had continued pain in the right upper quadrant of his stomach/abdominal region that comes and goes with no particular pattern and has gotten substantially worse over time. The nausea has also not relented and he is having a great deal of difficulty having bowel movements. He 1.) cannot have one at all, 2.) can have one, but it is mainly diarrhea or ""rabbit turds"" as he calls them (Haha :-)) and there is very little of that.  His primary care physician has run all manner of blood tests, performed an ultrasound and a CT scan, and has found no physical evidence that there is anything wrong other than a swollen spleen. We were referred to a Hematologist/Oncologist, who ran more blood tests and performed an exam. Everything came back totally normal. That doctor referred us to a Gastroenterologist, who performed an upper endoscopy scope. There was some mild inflammation along his digestive tract and the doctor took biopsies. A few days later, a hepatobiliary scan (HIDA scan) was performed to measure the function of his gallbladder and liver. Again, the results of both tests were completely normal. As a preventative measure, the doctor prescribed Protonix once a day and Sucralfate twice a day. My fiance is now scheduled for a colonoscopy later on this month.  On his own, he has tried a liquid diet, removing dairy from his diet and probiotics to no avail. This entire ordeal has been very draining on my fiance. He has not been able to eat, sleep or function normally for the majority of the last two months. He is in constant fear of when the pain and nausea will strike again, as there is no discernible pattern.

It would move back and forth between my belly button and my side. I had gas, pain with bowel movements that were either loose or constipated. Then I noticed the pain would go back and forth between under my ribs, similar to where my gall bladder and pancreas are and then back down low. I had tons of testing done and everything was either negative or inconclusive. I was 5 pregnant so they did not do a CT but they did do a MRI and lots of blood work and took a stool sample. Then, the pain slowly dissipated in the next two weeks. Yesterday, the pain appeared again, this Time even worse. I am nauseous and In lots of pain and have horrible painful gas. I am also extremely and noticeably bloated and it happened within one day so I know it’s not the pregnancy. It seems to sit on my lower right side but will move up occasionally. I don’t think this would be appendicitis because appendicitis doesn’t typically flare up and move to the upper quadrant? I’ve never had this before and I am unsure of what to think about it.

Help or Advise,"For many years now i believe after reading online that i have been suffering from whats called ( Sexsomnia ) I do also have pretty severe sleep apnea and use a cpap machine. My major issue here and concern is i seem to frequently masturbate, i wake up in the morning and im just covered in dried up cum, i have had sex while asleep but this does not happen nearly as much as the masturbation. My penis started to get raw right underneath the head of my penis as i must be rubbing alot. I finally set up a camera and it appears that i will masturbate at times on and off for hours, cumming 2 or even 3 times. I now have to sleep naked so i dont have to do as much laundry. After doing the video for 30 days straight It seems this happens mostly within the first several hours of falling asleep. More troubling concerns is when i sleep away from home, i have stayed in Hotels and woke up with my curtains open and im naked on the bed, i have woken up with my door open and several times woken up to another person in my bed whom i did not know and finding out i had sex with a total stranger. Whats even scarier is not knowing what has happen the times i woke up with my door open and im just laying on bed naked, people have left me notes telling me they had a good time. Does anyone know how to control this? My sex drive when im asleep appears to be off the hook,to avoid getting my penis rubbed raw i now cover my penis in lotion before i fall asleep, it seems to somewhat work but i do end up rubbing the lotion mostly off. I even had to move one time out of total humiliation due to my sleepwalking and masturbating outside. I need help with this but embarrassed to ask the Dr i mean what do i say>? What will she offer to do? Is there test or medication that can help? I am so freaked out over this, just wondering what i have done now over the years or who i have done it with, i stay often in hotels and the door open has happen so many times.

Sometimes, I have already experienced problems getting and holding an erection, but such symptoms were triggered mainly by anxiety, stress, depression and similar reasons. Several last times I could not get the desired erection, irrespective of all the things I tried. Therefore, I started searching the Internet in hope to find good advice. However, everything I found was the recommendation to address the doctor and get impotence treatments. Visiting your healthcare specialist and telling him about sexual disorders sounded weird for me and very embarrassing, to tell you the truth, so I decided to keep searching. At some point I came across the online drugstore, claiming to fight erectile complications fast and effectively. And the most beneficial thing there was free Viagra samples . The offer was extremely tempting, as I did not have to pay for the medication or similar issues. The only things I had to do were to make my order and cover delivery expenses. I did it all and was waiting for the medication. Definitely, I had different thoughts but didn’t want to rush. Finally, in a few days, the medication was at my doorstep. Everything was fully anonymous. There wasn't even my name on the parcel. So, after consulting the online doctor, I took a single Viagra pill. It was around an hour before pre-planned sex, since I tried to follow all the instructions. How impressed I was when finally after many failed attempts I got a hard erection, which lasted for over 4 hours. When the trial pack was over, I addressed the same pharmacy and bought another pack of this magic pill. Additionally, I received a pleasant discount as a returning customer. The best ED treatment and the most reliable drugstore. Definitely recommended!Ordered here :",Men's Issues

First only cigarettes then marijuana as well. I started travelling more and my healthy living declined. I would overdose on Marijuana until I got panic attacks. I would only do it just so I could forget about my depression and then feel better after getting over those panic attacks. After a pretty heavy one I decided to cut down on the weed. But then, in late 2016 just as I was getting over the breakup I had the weirdest pain I ever experienced. This happened a week after I got some tooth fillings at the dentist. I was in the office at work and all of a sudden I felt a weird feeling in my stomach, sharp pain, difficulty breathing and my heart racing. I got completely confused and told my manager think I am having a heart attack. Went to the A&E where they told me to take some Nexium (40 mg a day) and Gaviscon. I kept on having similar attacks every couple of days for another week or so. Then I gradually got better (not all symptoms had diminished but at least the panic attacks had stopped) . However, after I stopped the Nexium, I got an awful acid rebound. Pain got back worse and so did panic attacks which I used to get at night time. I was put on Pantoprazole 40 mg and Ranitidine 300 MG. Took about 2 months until I got a bit better and the panic attacks at night stopped too. I had an endoscopy done and all the doc could see was mild gastritis. Had parasite testing done as well as stool tests to look for parasites and potential IBD antigens . All came back clear.  I went back on a healthy diet, quit smoking (including the weed), started doing sports again (exercising twice a day 5 times a week) and also started travelling almost every month (as it took my mind off the pain, distracted and relaxed me) The pain diminished I would say by 70%. I stopped the Pantoprazole, and only continued to take the 300mg Ranitidine. I still experienced abdominal pain almost daily (not heartburn pain, rather just a dull pain just above my navel) so I thought I was on the right path.  Earlier this year I went to the dentist, had a tooth filling done and then back home. I took my usual pills before bedtime (Ranitidine and Tenofovir - the hep b medication) without water. The following morning I got up with bad heartburn and a feeling a lump in throat. The following, day, however, the lump feeling in my throat turned into excruciating pain, so bad I could barely swallow my own saliva. I was referred for an endoscopy and the doc saw a bad ulcer in my mid esophagus. (although interestingly, my stomach was completely fine - no more gastritis - despite the ongoing abdominal pain) I was put on PPIs again (Pantoprazole - 80 mg/ day this time) but after 2 months the pain in my throat still didn't go away. I was also given dihydrocodeine to help me with the pain . So then my doc switched my PPIS from Pantoprazole to Esomeprazole (Nexium). He gave me 120 MG a day. After a few days taking the esomeprazole I went out and noticed my ears were ringing really bad. I thought this might be a side effect of Nexium so I went back to my doc. He told me he thinks it was just a coincidence - that the tinnitus was probably due to the loud music - and even if it was caused by Nexium it would wear off after I stopped it - but for the time being he advised me keep on the Nexium. I kept on taking the Nexium for 3 weeks without any improvement. But the tinnitus stayed. I stopped taking the Nexium and went for another endoscopy. The doc said the ulcer healed completely so there was no point in PPIs anymore.  The conclusion of the doc was that what I have is neuropathic pain, pain coming from the damaged nerves in the stomach and esophagus so now he put me on amitriptyline (30 mg/a day) but he said this would take a few weeks to work. However, this only a symptomatic treatment - to treat the nerve pain (if indeed what I have is just nerve pain) So basically I have 3 symptoms now : abdominal dull pain, lump in my throat feeling/pain and loud tinnitus. Has anyone experienced anything like this? Could there be any connection between the 3?  I was considering doing an expensive comprehensive stool analysis test to check for additional harder to find parasite (costs about 300 pounds) Do you think that's worth it? Also do you think the tooth fillings might have had anything to do with the symptoms or was it pure coincidence? I've been really depressed lately and I don't really know where to go anymore. NHS seems to be failing me so I am considering a private clinic. If you know of a good private clinic please let me know.

When I was younger I used to religiously pop a Zantac or Pepcid when I had symptoms for many days or, sometimes, I would take them preventatively before going out to dinner or a night of drinks. As I got older I started sporadically doing courses of 7-14 days of Prilosec b/c of the heartburn but it always felt that it was more preventative than anything as I now realize that my heartburn - although annoying - was not that bad. There may have been times I did Prilosec for months b/c my doctor may have recommended it. About 2 years ago, in between the short episodes of heartburn, I started developing a rash that would come and go in my arms and back. I went to doctors and they all concurred it was allergic and I had to figure out what I was allergic to. Needless to say, I cut out many things, stopped eating gluten and soy, changed soaps, shampoos, detergents, etc. Rash would still pop in every now and then. And heartburn was still around.  Come my birthday earlier this year and I may have celebrated a bit too much with friends and during a trip to Las Vegas. Of course I overindulged and my heartburn really *really* flared up even though I was taking Prilosec -- now twice a day per recommendation of the doctor. And I mean this heartburn was either the kind that you have to find a place to lay down on your belly or the kind that you feel you may be having a heart attack... So I really felt like something was very wrong with me. When I had the worst episode I gave in to having an endoscopy which resulted in ""mild gastritis and esophagitis"". Doctor said: ""...keep taking Prilosec twice a day"". By this time I had given up alcohol, coffee, tea, chocolate... life was pretty boring and I still had no relief. I also went to see an ENT b/c I was having episodes where I felt I could not breathe well. Of course he said to get my heartburn under control and it would go away and to ask my gastro if he could switch my meds to Protonix which I did. So that didn't make it any better... maybe it even got worse.  Then, I started remembering how the day I went to have the endoscopy I was actually feeling very well (even though the previous day I had considered going to the ER b/c of the heartburn being so unbearable). The only thing different I did that day was not take any medication (Prilosec/Zantac/Protonix... nothing) b/c you have to be on an empty stomach. That day I even had delicious Vietnamese food after my endoscopy and had no pain. So, one day I said, I'm just going to wean myself off of the heartburn meds. Slowly but surely, once I had not taken the meds for about a week the heartburn started going away. The times when it crept up I started managing it using an essential oil blend with ginger/anise/peppermint (not that I'm advocating their use... just trying to give the full picture here). I recently went on a trip again and overindulged a bit with food/drinks with friends and the next day I took a drop the essential oil blend with some water and refrained from taking any heartburn meds. All was well in a day... all back to normal. Bottom line is that even though it has been only about 3 months since I stopped taking the proton inhibitors and other heartburn meds, I have not felt this well in a very long time and I think it was worthwhile trying to let my body heal on its own.

Doctors have remarked on my protruding rib but have not been able to find a cause for it.

Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/56441/bowel-movement-urgency-when-on-public-transport,Bowel movement urgency when on public transport,"**Disclaimer: I am 28 years old, female, and pretty healthy save for a lifelong history of constipation.** For the last two months or so, I've been experiencing a very uncomfortable and distressing trend. Whenever I am on a bus or light rail, I get intestinal cramping, increased flatulence, faster/harder heartbeat, and feel as if I have the urgent need to use the bathroom. Deep, controlled breathing doesn't help. Several of these situations did result in me having borderline diarrhea once I got myself to a toilet, but most of the time I find that I am constipated, needing to strain to get anything out at all (if anything at all). This does NOT occur when I am riding in a car, while walking, or when sitting someplace stationary (home, work, even a sports game). In those situations, I might feel a completely normal need to have a bowel movement, but nothing to the degree that I feel on buses.  I have dealt with constipation for most of my life and have been trying to find ways to treat it, and as of one year ago I've been improving my diet with more water and fiber. But I don't believe this diet change is what's been causing this horrible feeling, since it's only been happening for over a month (and the diet changes have not made any positive impact on my constipation, either). As a result, I've been having to take ride share services to get around instead of the bus, resulting in me spending waaaay more money than I should be (my bus pass is at a discounted price through my employer and grants me unlimited bus rides each month, so it's a great deal). I do not know how to drive and never have had to own a car. If this is some sudden flare-up of IBS that I've been unaware of, then there's little I can do since I've been doing everything that would naturally be suggested for IBS in the first place: More fiber, more water, and regular (light) exercise. I've been seeing a nutritionist and am about to talk to my gastroenterologist in two weeks, and the only advice I've been given so far has been to try probiotics (nutritionist) or a fiber supplement (gastro). The first time I tried the probiotic I was recommended, it made me feel horribly sick the following morning, giving me nausea, gas, and diarrhea, so I didn't take it again after that. But last night (almost 2 weeks after I first tried the probiotic) I finally got around to opening the capsule so that I could pour 1/4 of the contents into a glass of water (as recommended by not only my nutritionist but also the probiotic's developer), and I had no side effects this morning. So, I will see if that does anything over the next few months. And if that fails to help my constipation and random urgency, then I will resort to the fiber supplement (Cetracel was the one my gastro mentioned). But of course, if the probiotic helps at all, it will take some time, so I am posting here to see if anyone has any suggestions in the meantime. Please note that this uncomfortable, anxiety-inducing feeling has ONLY been happening on public transportation. That leads me to believe that whatever is wrong with my gut right now is becoming agitated/stimulated by the often exaggerated motions of buses, whereas a car and even walking are far smoother and controlled. But...why the heck would that be happening in the first place? Especially if the urgency is not always related to diarrhea/soft stools? This has been causing tons of unnecessary stress/anxiety and I feel I am burning my money away.",

But a little bit after that he has a white substance as well. He isn't cercumsiced. So we went to the doctors and we both got checked for stds, we came back clean. He just had some type of fungus. We never went to go get his prescription. But it went away for a little while. We just made sure to shower afterwards. Soon after that it came back but worse he had two little cuts at the base of the head of his penis. We stopped having sex and started treating it our self's. Every time we went to the doctor they would say we were good. But it kept happening. I asked if if was me? My fluids, or if my yeast level is to high or if I have some type of bactireal infection going on  And she said no. We don't know what else to do.

They used his left mammary artery for the bypass of his LAD. Last week he had an abnormal stress test. He has had no pain or problems since the surgery 8 years ago. The test showed a definite change since his last stress test last year. He had an Angiogram on Tuesday, and 3 biodegradable (BVS) stents were used to open up his mid and ostial LAD. The other 3 bypasses were in great shape. We were not asked if we wanted the BVS stents, but you sign forms before you go in, so that is that. We trust his doctor but after doing reading BVS and finding out that as of 9/14/17 they are off the market because of poor sales, I am concerned. I was excited that he got dissolving stents, as the idea of metal in an artery for life, is scary. Has anyone here gotten the BVS stents? Or know anything about them?  Thanks.",Heart Disease

A week later i noticed a clear discharge from my penis, no pain. went back to my DR, had an ultrasound on bladder which was fine and was urine tested again which came back negative for STD but found blood in urine, and was given antibiotics for a UTI. Antibiotic stopped blood in urine but didn't do anything else, started getting pain in testicles, and full feeling (no burning) in urethra along with clear discharge.  Went back to DR again and had discharge swabbed, which came back negative again. DR told me it was nothing. I seeked a second opinion and after another negative urine & discharge-swab test i was treated for NGU, which cleared up the pain and discharge. At the beginning of November i've noticed just a pain in the groin/testicle area, returned to second DR who did a blood test for prostate (negative) and an ultrasound on the testicles, which showed the left testicle slightly bigger than the right. DR isn't sure what is going on, but doesn't think it's related to the initial problems i had as it hasn't been continuous.

I had done so once for 3 days straight. The third day felt sort of stiff and tight at and around the base of my penis. I was able to ejaculate and thought maybe it was just from doing it excessively.  I continued on with business for the rest of the night. The fourth day (or third night) was odd in that I did ejaculate, but also had gotten horny no more than 14 hours later during the middle of the night from the previous session. That was when I could feel the stiffness again. Only this time it felt worse, almost like a very tight stiffness or maybe ""cramp"" if I could climax... ...I felt sort of tired from stroking and trying to maintain an erection over the course of say 30-40 minutes. I was able to ejaculate...but as soon as I ""released"" my semen, I felt this overly exciting sensational feeling, that turned painful and uncontrollable within seconds. The pain was felt at the base and felt pain shoot up to my neck and parts of the front and sides of my head/brain. I couldn't control myself with the pain felt in both places and this sensation feeling that is normal during such sexual activity. It almost felt like maybe it was ""seizure-like"" up in my aforementioned frontal part of the head/brain and sides. All parts sort of felt ""locked"" up for the duration of this event. Afterwards, I felt so nervous and worried about what could had just happened. I didn't black out or anything. I didn't feel anywhere near tired. I was up for the rest of the night practically scared and reminiscing the feelings. I talked to my general doc about it. IIRC he thinks it may be related to an urinary infection? Online posts suggest that my testicles or body parts couldn't reproduce certain chemicals/substances from over doing it(?) I waited for roughly a month for anything to subside teaching myself not to stroke. Yesterday I gave at it for the first time since and I only felt the base sort of tighten up again, but not *as* bad. What could be the issue(s)? Is this curable?

I'm in the process of figuring out what's going on with some lower gastro issues I've been having. With the symptoms I've been experiencing, my doctor is leaning towards the possibility of crohn's disease. I don't have any issues with heart burn or the other symptoms that come with GERD and I don't use NSAIDS ever. If it turns out that my doctor diagnoses me with crohn's, could that explain the biopsy report? Below is the information from my Upper Endoscopy. 1. Duodenum, biopsy: - Negative for increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes on the CD3 immunostain. - Negative for parasites/Giardia. - Negative for dysplasia or malignancy. 2. Gastric, antrum, biopsy: - Mild inactive chronic gastritis with features of chemical gastropathy (NSAIDs/bile reflux).  - Negative for dysplasia or malignancy. - Negative for intestinal metaplasia by Alcian blue stain. - Negative for Helicobacter by immunostain. 3. Esophagus, distal, biopsy: - Moderate to marked esophagitis with 0-20 eosinophils/hpf. (See comment).  - Negative for intestinal metaplasia by Alcian blue stain. - Negative for dysplasia or malignancy. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS: - Pre-Op Dx: Generalized abdominal pain. - EGD Findings: GERD without esophagitis. Gastritis. - Impression: Mild chronic reflux changes. Biopsied to rule out - Barrett''s. Mild diffuse gastritis. Biopsied to rule out H. pylori. - Normal examined duodenum. Biopsied to rule out Celiac. COMMENT: - Significant eosinophilic inflammation can be a component of reflux - esophagitis. However the degree of eosinophilia in this biopsy also - raises the possibility of eosinophilic esophagitis. Clinical correlation - is recommended. If there is clinical uncertainty between these two - possibilities, repeat biopsies of the mid to upper esophagus may be - informative (as the eosinophilia associated with reflux tends to decrease - proximally while that associated with eosinophilic esophagitis typically - persists or may increase proximally).","GERD and Heartburn , IBD"

I had drunk the night before and had a bit of a hang over to. The doctors kept saying acid re-flux but the medication would only make it worse.  Eventually it was discovered I had a lot of stones in my gal bladder and it was removed. But I was still having the throat issues.  Over time I narrowed down the food that causes the issues to Palm and Peanut oil. Such as chicken from chic-fil-a and marylands with peanut oil, and palm oil from various sources through trial and error.  I found if I did accidentally eat something containing them I could get quick relief if I expelled the acid created by these two oils later otherwise I would feel it all day along with constant saliva production. The acid always seems to be sitting on the top of whatever was in my stomach so I never expelled any stomach acid. The amount expelled always seems to match the amount of peanut or palm oil I had consumed.  What is with these to oils and why do i have problems with only them? I can eat other fatty foods no problem such as Popeyes chicken, Churches chicken, bacon, etc with no problem at all.  What part of these oils am I likely unable to digest?

PLEASE read/help,"I have a really long story & complicated medical history, but I'm going to keep things short & to the point as to not turn people away. I am so desperate for an answer.   I'm a 25 year old female who has been having a myriad of gastrointestinal issues for the last almost two years. During the summer of 2016 I had my first bout with severe diarrhea, which I honestly thought originated from food poisoning. Obviously this was not the case as this symptom and (new ones to follow) has become pervasive in my life. Here are my symptoms as well as diagnoses/treatments/procedures mentioned as they occurred chronologically.  -I have been having mouth sores since I was in elementary school. During high school & then college years they progressed.  -July 2014: Heart palpitations began SUDDENLY. They lasted for 24/7 for five months straight. EKG normal. I was severely underweight at this time & advised to gain weight, which should resolve symptoms. They eventually subsided, but would come back suddenly & randomly, lasting for short periods of time.  -Diagnosed with a gluten intolerance November 2014 - began a GF diet, which I still adhere to now.  -Mouth sores went away for maybe a year and then reappeared worse than before. - Summer of 2016: GI issues, namely - bloating, cramping, lower abdominal pain (esp. right quadrant), frequent watery diarrhea, inability to ""wait"" to use the bathroom, weight loss. -September 2016: Heart palpitations resumed. First referral to Cardiologist & Gastroenterologist. Full cardiac work-up (EKG, Echo, Stress Test, 24-hr holter monitor) normal.  -Diagnosed with GERD by GI doctor. Began omeprazole 20 mg daily. -Feb. 2017 Follow up with GI scheduled upper GI endo as symptoms did not resolve. -March 10, 2017 Endoscopy with six biopsies negative for Celiac disease. Evidence of gastritis was diagnosis.  -Began having bloody diarrhea and weight loss again. Colonoscopy performed May 3rd, 2017. Negative for microscopic colitis.  -June 2017: Pillcamera was negative for Celiac. Showed delayed transit.  -August 1, 2017 diagnosed with IBS.  The same symptoms persisted. I stopped visiting this GI doctor because he didn't test biopsies for Crohn's like I had asked & I know IBS does NOT cause bleeding. I disagree with this dx.  -October 2017: diagnosed with Sicca (Dry eye) & eye inflammation.  -Rheumatology visit in October 2017 wherein I had genetic blood testing. I was found to have a positive HLA-B27 & two mutations of NOD2/CARD15/IBD1. Also found to be severely iron deficient. -November 30, 2017: Diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis. Started Celebrex 2x daily. Sulfasalazine recommended, but I have not taken it. -February 2017: Saw new GI doctor. Upped my dosage of Omeprazole to 40mg daily when it failed to work anymore.  -April 2017: x-ray of abdomen revealed what appears to be constipation. I can't imagine how I could have such horrible diarrhea with this. Also revealed Kidney stone. Sonogram revealed tumor in kidney believed to be angiomyolipoma. I am currently following up with a Nephrologist.  This is where I am at currently. As we speak, I have two ulcers in my mouth. These are the third & fourth ulcers I have had in about four weeks, one of which took up nearly half of my tongue & caused such severe swelling. I am in sheer agony & cannot eat, chew, and struggle to talk. I am at the end of my rope.  My main issues right now are severe diarrhea, sometimes bloody, usually always yellow in color (it is reminiscent to me of when I was doing the bowel prep for my colonoscopy), severe bloating wherein my pants cannot be buttoned, oral ulcers, heart palpitations, severe fatigue, shortness of breath upon exertion - I cannot use the stairs, frequent urination. I am so spent. I seriously cannot live like this anymore. I know something is wrong with me. Anyone have similar experience? Please, please share. I can't stress how badly I want answers. I almost don't even care what they are anymore.  My guess is Crohn's. They just can't seem to find it, but I know it can take years to diagnose. My genetic profile suggests Crohn's as NOD2 is also called IBD1 (Inflammatory Bowel Disease). I know oral ulcers are a manifestation of Crohn's & I've had mine swabbed for herpes, infectious disease, etc. all negative.

Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/53932/repeal-of-individual-health-mandate,Repeal of Individual Health Mandate,"The Affordable Care Act (ACA) came into effect in 2010 when President Obama was in office. Under this Act, any resident living in the United States was required to have health insurance or be faced with penalties. There were specific standards that insurance holders had to withhold which could be quite expensive for individuals who couldn’t afford it. Penalties for individuals who didn’t have insurance throughout the year began at $695, which was collected by the IRS during tax season. Penalties would be prorated if an individual had insurance for part of the year and penalties were capped after a certain point if the individual continued to not obtain coverage. January 2017, President Trump worked to repeal the individual mandate. This was accomplished, resulting in residents having the choice to choose health care coverage or not without being forced to. For American’s this was a benefit, for hospitals it was a drawback. According to statistics given by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) they estimate that by 2026 there will be approximately 13 million more people who do not have health care coverage. By not having coverage it shifts health care cost to other residents through taxes and higher premiums for their own coverage. With higher premiums, less people will be able to afford good health care coverage. Hospitals that are affected by this repeal will be urged to invest in other alternative payment models (APMs) as Medicare tries to move providers toward a value-based purchasing model (DaVanzo, 2016). This move would help to curb the negative effects that will come from the repeal. According to DaVanzo, (2016) “Medicare does not pay for the expenses required to implement APMs, such as Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) or the various mandated payment bundling programs and does not compensate for the increased financial risk to the hospital industry as it accepts more operational risk under APMs.” The revenue that would be lost because of the ACA repeal will be counterproductive when trying to improve health care spending and reduce federal deficits. Hospitals will be stuck footing the bill when patients cannot pay, and reimbursements have been reduced. To ensure transitions from the repeal run smoothly, providers need to be proactive and efficient. According to Morse (2017), “the surgery schedule must be full, and documentation must be pristine to ensure reimbursement. Health systems must be ready to diversify their lines of business to such operations as institutional catering services.” In all, although residents will now have a choice in their healthcare coverage, the implication that there are no financial effects by not having medical insurance, is in hopes that more people will want to get covered willingly.",

Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/54028/bowel-and-bladder-health-making-me-smell-bad,Bowel and bladder health making me smell bad.,"Hi, I'm a 28 year old male having some bladder and bowel issues. I've had bowel trouble for a number of years but recently I'm going to the toilet too frequently (up to 6 times a day) and the constitution is really loose.  I'm losing some feeling in my colon and back passage and am often having to rush to the toilet. The need to go to the toilet doesn't come gradually, it comes intensely and suddenly often resulting in near misses and even after going to the toilet my bowels still feel full. I thought it would be mostly down to my diet so I made some changes, It's not the healthiest diet but it's not bad enough that it should affect my bowels this much, it seems no matter what I eat it results in my spending most of the next day on the toilet. The problem isn't really how many times I'm going to the toilet, the problem is that when I go to the toilet my bowel movements are so unhealthy and foul smelling that no matter how much toilet paper I use to clean myself (and I really do clean myself, to the point where there's blood) the smell is still tends to linger, I personally can't smell it due to how much I smoke but I can see by other people's reactions that they can smell it, such as family members covering their noses when I'm around or over hearing the people I walk past in the street saying that I smell like I've *** myself.  It's the same even if I've had a shower and properly scrubbed myself clean, I still hear people I walk past comment on it. I'm also having bladder issues but I'm not sure as to whether the issues are related, much like with my bowels I'm losing some feeling resulting in some leakage which largely goes unnoticed until I hear other people comment on the smell. The need to urinate doesn't come urgently, instead it feels like my bladder is only slightly full, like I only need the toilet a little bit but when I go there's a lot more urine than I thought there would be. Much like the issue with my bowels this also results in me smelling bad if I've sat in my clothes for too long, I'm having to change my underwear a few times a day to avoid smelling of urine. I've been to my doctor about this and he gave me 3 days of anti-biotics in case it was an infection but they didn't seem to work. I've asked my family members out right if I smell dirty and they say I smell fine, but the people saying I smell fine are the ones that are covering their noses when I'm around, I often catch my brother sniffing me when I'm walking past him or something but when I ask if I smell he says no. Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this and had a diagnosis? I'm too scared to go to appointments to find out what''s wrong for fear of having accidents while I'm out. Any information on what could possibly be causing these symptoms and how to alleviate them would be much appreciated, I'm currently using loperamide to relieve the bowel symptoms which helps a bit.","IBD , Irritable Bowel Syndrome , Bloating"

I know it was really stupid, I was having a bad time and majorly regretting it now. They both swore they were clean (not enough proof obviously I still should've used a condom). I fully intend to never go without a condom with a new partner again. I'm really angry with myself. I am going to go for a full STD test soon. Anything bacterial that I can clear up with antibiotics I'm not too worried about. Sure it's not great... but at least my silly mistake won't be stuck with me forever.  My vulva area is very red and itchy, mainly around the vaginal opening and the left upper inner thigh next to the anus (perhaps a nappy rash type thing?). I do have the cottage cheese discharge associated with thrush, I'm pretty sure I at least have thrush as I've had it before, and I do wear a lot of tight jeans and synthetic tights. Working in a bar sometimes I have come home and passed out fully dressed as soon as I've sat on the bed from tiredness which obviously hasn't let the area breathe.  However I know these symptoms can be associated with STDs and I'm kind of worried. I've been reading up on herpes and scared myself. I don't have any 'pain' as such or pain as I pee. Just soreness/burning on the red raw skin from scratching. I thought I saw some bumps that could be herpes sores but I've just shaved so I don't know if I could be from that as they are in awkward places that are difficult to shave and can lead to ingrown hairs. I have always had pretty sensitive skin all over my body, so any itchy parts are very red and sensitive.  Also the bumps around the vaginal opening, I'm not sure what these are? They're not sores, they just seem to be bumps that appeared I can't remember when (before the unprotected sex). Genital warts? (Even though I'd only had protected sex beforehand) Clogged hair follicles? Basically I'm scared that no one will ever want to sleep with me or be in a relationship again if I come back with a lifelong thing :( I just feel dirty and depressed...

I'm a 19 year old male with a past history of ""abdominal discomfort"" such as GallStones, Ulcers, IBS which was later diagnosed as IBD which was then diagnosed as Celiac disease (Gotta love half a$$ doctors ^.^). One thing they did manage to provide me with was a CBC and a few other labs I asked for, which showed I'm anemic, lymphs were nicely elevated and my AST was sky high at 110 with my ALT sitting perfect. Might i add, all of my general abdominal pain started after I went from 270lb to 175lb in 8 months just from working out with a stupid, very malnourished diet.  I grew very wary with the extreme ignorance of the doctors I visited (all seemed to think I was out to get their precious drugs :) so I started researching home remedies, not the greatest move for someone that didn't know anything about what was going on with my body at the time, ill admit. But I did it anyways and one of the first things I did was the famous liver/gallblader flush. It worked, and was pleased with the results of what i passed and how I felt afterwords, so I did a few more flushes within a couple month period. Well i ran into a problem a couple flushes before my last, a problem all liver flushers fear, a stone got stuck right were a duct empties into the stomach. I followed with 2 flushes and passed the mothership of stones, followed by several bowel movements of just stones.  Since then I've chilled out with home remedies and have gotten better insurance and a proper referral to one of the best gastroenterologist in my area which I can't see till May 23rd. The problem is i have a mass growing since the flushing incident, approximately 3"" below my sternum (first person viewing), positioned 1/8"" to the right of the rectus abdomens downward line. The mass is about the size of a quarter, soft but not lipomas soft and seems spherically shaped. The mass is manageable painwise , only when I don't eat proper and consistently does it get out of control. My stomach also tends to hold onto food far longer then its suppose to, which sometimes results in me feeling like my blood sugar is dropping, shaky, cold sweats, etc...not sure if this related to the mass or not.

About 28 years ago he was in a car accident and had to have surgery on both intestines to have them repaired after they were ripped (he also broke his hip in 5 places). He had to have surgery again about 8-10 years ago after they ripped at home (scar tissue) and he was septic. So from time to time since, he'll move wrong or something and basically will be stuck in bed for days. Sometimes he can't even get up to go to the bathroom. For about the last month he's been complaining of pain and it's gotten even more severe over the last week, with a few days where again he couldn't get out of bed. I took him to the ER yesterday (no insurance, so can't see a primary care doctor) and they basically laughed in our faces and said it was just muscle spasms. They wouldn't listen when we told them that it's a pre-existing condition that he has had surgery for at that same hospital. They gave him muscle relaxers and sent us home. The only ""exam"" they did was push on both his belly and back at the same time. I don't think it's just muscle spasms, and we can't afford to go anywhere else, so I was wondering if anyone could help with what's going on? He says the pain is a sharp, stabbing pain. Usually in the area of his kidneys but it moves around to the front sometimes. He also said it alternates sides. Sometimes the pain is down in his hips/groin area. It does not hurt to pee and he doesn't have any trouble going to the bathroom (assuming he can get out of bed). Sometimes he can't lift his legs and it hurts a lot to move his hips. He doesn't have any trouble eating, no fever either. Laying down is the best relief.  I understand that it could be muscle spasms. I'm just concerned that it actually is coming from his intestines and not just muscles. He was septic before and almost died, but I don't feel like any doctor we have seen takes him seriously. He's otherwise in good health - no drugs or smoking. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what we could/should do or what it could be? Thank you.",

My question is: Is there anything I can do to increase the chances of having one huge bowel movement at 5:30 AM to completely clear me out, so I don't need to go two or three more times over the nest two hours, even with nothing to eat?  I did make things much better by stopping my AM dose of metformin for my diabetes, so I rarely feel an urgent need, but I do not want ANY need after 5:30 AM, for at least another 10-12 hours. Any advice would be welcome. I have no idea how people can eat a huge meal in the morning, and then get in their cars without any concern for an emergency pit stop.",

My Backstory; in 2000,(when I was 11 years old) I had a surgical repair for patent ductus ateriosus (PDA). In 2014 I was on the medication isotretinoin (accutane) for 5 months for acne. The accutane raised my cholesterol levels up to 246mg/ dl. Every single year after that, I had blood work done for my health insurance and my total cholesterol has been above average since. In 2017 my total cholesterol was 210mg/ dl while my other cholesterols were fine. My current blood pressure is 116/69. I also experience orthostatic hypotension, which I was tested for years ago and my doctor at the time couldn't detect it. Also I have anxiety. Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone thought this was an urgent matter and I should see a doctor. Honestly I have had huge problems with past doctors, with them not taking the time for me or with them not believing any complaints I have. Such as the orthostatic hypotension issue I've had since my PDA in 2000, so I am very hesitant to go see them. Just want to get your opinions. Thank you","Heart Disease , Cholesterol Control"

I have had strong pain in both my lower legs (calves and shins) for quite a while now. It all started around 2-3 years ago. Everytime I walked at a faster pace, my calves would cramp and hurt extremely until I sit down or pause in the middle of the road. The pain gets so bad that I feel like my both feet are going completely numb from the pain and that I would have to drag them around. I don´t have any pain when resting. Except that I get a weird pain in my left front thigh when I sit down with my legs straight. The walking pain has changed my life to the worse. I simply cannot walk fast and without breaks. It makes me go late to school and if I force myself to ignore the pain it gets so bad that I cry from the pain. It has gotten much worse the past few months. I have had periods without any pain at all but I don´t understand why. Okay, so now you think I am probably STILL too young to have PAD and that it is probably something else. But there is a huge problem. I have had severe depression for the past seven years and have barely left my house except for school. I sit all the time and I have been a strong smoker for years. Due to all the inactivity I have gained around 30kg since my depression kicked in. I am now obese (164cm, 90kg), a heavy smoker (25 cigarettes a day for years) and I barely do anything else than sitting infront of the pc and school. I am almost sure that it´s PAD (Peripheral artery disease) and it makes me incredibly terrified and depressed. I have talked to my doctor but she didn´t seem to take it seriously until now. I am waiting for an appointment with a specialist. But the fear is overcoming my senses and I dread the outcome. I am so scared that my concerns are true and that my life quality will greatly sink because of what I did to myself for years... I have to mention that I have a severe health anxiety and usually I would force myself to not dread the worst possible outcome but I can´t help it this time... It´s just too real.",

To begin with I really don't know whether to describe it as a flutter, palpitation, skipped beat, extra beat or what so bear with me. Since my 30's I remember having sporadic heart palpitations, not often but nevertheless noticeable to me. There have been times where they became more often for a period of months and then went back to ""normal"". Back when I was a university student I once became so angry with my roommate that I got heart palpitations for a few seconds. This scary feeling has been with me all my adult life, I am 54 now. I am hypothyroid on a relatively low dosage (250 ug/week) since 2007. Additionally -an probably because of thyroid problem- I also have low Free Testosterone (not a lot but under the range) and I read that testosterone can cause heart issues as well. Additionally to that, I usually have low heart rate of around 54-57 beats per minute (rest). I do not suffer from High Blood Pressure, in fact my BP tends to be relatively low 110/70, 102/79, 121/80, etc. Having said that, in the past months I have come to another period where these palpitations have become more often. It can happen several times during the day (a few times at night) and can feel like a few beats, irregular beat, a thump, etc. the feeling varies I would say. Usually it is just an event that last only a beat or two and that is it. In the past few months I had a couple of occasions when it actually lasted like 3 or 4 seconds. During the events I NEVER felt dizzy, nor fainted, nor became disoriented, nor tired, at most I feel a bit breathless because of the anxiety this terrible feeling causes. I have also NEVER felt chest or shoulder pain. Although I am not a regular exerciser, I used to cycle every day, my work is more sitting at the computer. I do make the effort to walk 1.5 kilometers one or more times in a week, sometimes I go for a 4 km walk and quite frankly I do it happily and without feeling tired before, during or after the long walks at relatively higher pace (5.5 km/h) than most people walk, I just can't stand to walk slowly. If I get angry or excited when talking I can get an extra beat or two. I am NOT overweight, in fact for my height (1.84 meters) I am nearly bordering underweight (65 Kg). My belly isn't large, I am slender though my belly is the only place were ""fat"" accumulates. But, sometimes when I kneel for example, or tense my tummy like to pull it in, then I get this ""event"" as well. Not always but I have noticed it happens on some of those occasions. My cholesterol levels are also good, I do not take any medication for blood pressure or cholesterol. I sometimes go to the gym and use the static bicycle for half an hour at different levels of resistance. Sure, I sweat a lot when I do that but at the end I am neither tired nor breathless. At one time years ago I was taking vitamin supplements and I noticed an increase in the ""events"". I don't know if it was coincidental or what. I stopped taking them. A few weeks ago I started D3 and B12 supplements. Years ago (2008) when I was having them more often I had a chest X Ray (don't have it) and a Holter for 24-hours. The DX was that there were some events but that they were not significant. Several months ago I had an EKG that had Dx of ""early repolarization"" and ""sinus bradycardia"" but other than that it did not indicate anything else so I was NOT referred to a cardiologist. But as I said, these events keep happening and I am very worried about it. I do not know if it is a heart condition or a hormone imbalance or vitamin imbalance or what.",

I went to the doctor a couple days after i noticed the bowel movement changes,and he initially thought I had gastro which he later changed to just constipation since i no longer has anymore cases of diarrhea. He prescribed me an osmotic laxative, which i took as directed. It didnt start working until about 4 days after taking and even when I say "" working "" i would still have to strain for very small peices of stool.  I returned to my doctor for more blood test which still showed nothing, he gave me more laxative and told me to return if doesnt clear up. During this time i was still constipated and the tenderness in my abdomen turned more to a numbing feeling that was only felt on the left side of my abdomen, espeically when standing up and moving quickly like going up and down stairs. I returned to my doctor two weeks ago and finally he sent me to get ultrasounds done by a separate company and he sent for blood work and stool samples. The ultrasound came back normal, blood work came back normal and i still haven't recieved the stool samples results back. Now im at the point where the past week ive been having pain going down through my right leg and my bowel movements need to be triggered by things like coffee, and their still just hard smaller stools. If anyone has every had anything similar or any advice on what could be going on id much appreciate, thanks","GERD and Heartburn , IBD , Crohn's Disease , Ulcers , Irritable Bowel Syndrome , Bloating , Ulcerative Colitis , Constipation"
Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/50446/stomach-issue-since-the-age-of-5,Stomach issue since the age of 5.,"Hello world of WebMD,  First-time poster because I am about at wit's end with my stomach. The first time I recall having this issue was on Christmas Eve when I was 5 years old.  Here is what I can tell you. Stabbing pain, top right of the stomach lasts from 7PM - 7AM (with early symptoms starting around 4-5, weird taste in my mouth.) I take extremely hot baths, rock my body, rub my feet, sit with a heating pad until I pass out from exhaustion. (As I type this I am sitting with the heating pad preparing for the rocky night.)  Also, I do not have regular bowel movements. Sometimes its every other day. And about once every 3-4 months this happens. What I think is happening and maybe there is a reason why is this. My body is not digesting food as normal stomachs would. When I have these ""Stomach episodes"" I will force myself to vomit (ONLY during these episodes do I self-purge.) What I have noticed when purging is that the food I have eaten from the morning is still solid. **when I get the early symptoms I stop any and all food intake for that day.**  I have been to doctors, I have been tested and scoped. I have spent many nights in the ER where the only thing that stops the pain is an IV. Pills do not work during these episodes (because the food is not digesting.)  Any and all help with this would be lovely. 27 Years of these episodes are enough.",

The only reason this was discovered was because I've been to the ER due to feeling absolutely horrible for several weeks. I've been totally exhausted- unable to exercise for more than a few minutes without wheezing, dizziness, profuse sweating, and chest tightness. Along with the anemia, it was clear that I am also in the first trimester of pregnancy. This complicates both the symptoms of the anemia and the available treatment options for it. Of course, a developing fetus demands iron and blood flow from the body, which strains the heart on top of the lack of oxygen and overworking of the heart that are present with the anemia. My problem is this: despite the fact that I've told my doctor about the chest pains and difficulty breathing, she didn't actually give me any advice. Given the situation, I think I should have some sort of protocol to follow in case I'm having really severe symptoms. A walk from my car, up 16 stairs, and through the door of my apartment should not leave me unable to breathe properly for SEVERAL MINUTES, while I literally feel like I am DYING. Not exaggerating this here, it's that bad. After this walk, I'm usually covered in sweat and can only manage to collapse onto my bed, breathing like I'd just run countless miles.

The Sotalol seems to be working with no further episodes. At our last visit to the EP Dr., I asked him if she has no Afib episodes, why should she remain on Eliquis? He responded that, over time, Afib symptoms may not be felt - you can be in Afib and not know it. Here is my question, understanding doctors are in the risk management business: If we monitor our heart rates 24/7 using Fitbit wrist devices, would that present an opportunity to discontinue the Eliquis since we would know if we have rapid heartbeat. If we notice the symptoms returning, we would return to traditional methods of medication and physician care. Just wondering if anyone else has probed this concept.

I am 22 years old, female. 6 months ago I presented symptoms that included CONSTANT stomach pain, up to 10 bathroom trips a day, very inconsistent stool(mostly loose) nausea/vomiting, and I have lost 40lbs in this time frame, unintentionally. My doctor couldn't beleive that at my age I lost that much weight that rapidly. I underwent a colonsocopy and endoscopy. They took 10+ biopsies. The pictures present imflammation and white patches. My histology report is troubling me, so maybe somebody could give me some insight if they had the same experience. A. Terminal Ileum -- Histologic sections show small intestinal mucosa with tall villi lined by columnar absorptive cells and interspered mucin secreting goblet cells. The epithelium overlies nodules of lymphoid tissue within the mucosa and submucosa. There is no significant acute inflammation or granulomas. B. Random Colon(He said my entire colon had all this in it) --Histologic sections show colonic mucosa with vertically oriented crypts resting on the muscularis mucosae. The surface epithelium is composed of columnar cells and goblet cells. The delicate lamina propria is edematous and contains modest population of mononuclear cells, including lympocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils. An occasional lymphoid aggregate is also noted.  C. Duodenum -- Histologic sections show duodenal mucosa with preserved villi lined by columnar cells and goblet cells. The lamina propria contains some inflammatory cells. D. Stomach, Antrum -- I was found to have mild chronic active gastritis and positive for helicobacter pylori organisms.  Histologic sections reveal gastic mucosa with increased infilintrate of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and plasma cells within the lamina propria. There is focal neutrophilic infiltration of foveola epitheliem. All biopsies came back negative for dysplasia and malignancy, Praise God. My problem is, the helicobater pylori diagnosis. I have been drinking the same tap water for years. Nobody else in my family is affected. I've had it before and I was very tempormental and treated with antibiotics. No big deal. I've done some research and it ranges from IBS, Ulcerative Colitis, Chrone's, to nothing(which would make no sense considering im only 22 and lost 40lbs) Id like to note I have severe anxiety/depression and have been screened on eating disorders and my thyroid doctor ran a full endocrine test so my thyroid isn't to blame. I stuff my face every day trrying to gain weight, just for it to run through me. During prep day for my colonoscopy, it was like an average day for me. The drinks ran through me within an hour, like everything else I ingest.  The notes of inflamation and immune cells has me questioning things.

I have had to apply for disability at 22, because I was fired because my boss didn't think I was ""mentally capable of working."" My anxiety has been high during this time, and running to and from the bathroom all day at work landed me jobless. I am staying home with my 1 year old now(which is a job technically, but my income was needed.) I am ashamed to admit I am very prideful for my age and disability seems like the easy way out, but at this point in my life, I don't have a choice. My anxiety and depression became ""unhandled"" once the weight started falling off, as if they werent as effective or something.

Heart Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/13521/please-help-me-solve-my-8-year-medical-mystery,Please Help Me Solve My 8 Year Medical Mystery,"I could really use some help here. I have been to so many doctors and hospitals in the last 8 years. I have scoured the internet. I can't find an answer to my problems. I have fought tooth and nail for my health, but lately, the fight is going out of me because doctor after doctor just shrug and send me elsewhere. It is hard to find hope when no one knows how to fix you.  I am a thirty one year old male. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure in 2009. I was in college at the time commuting to campus and I would suddenly keep getting very dizzy on the interstate. I wouldn't be able to get a good breath, my heart would start pounding, and I'd have to pull over. For all I know now medically at this point in time, I'd have said it was anxiety, but there was no real context for anxiety, and things only got crazier from there.  High blood pressure was the diagnosis they came up with at the time, and they slapped me with some prescriptions and sent me out the door. Unfortunately, after a couple of different medications, I began getting palpitations and low pulse. Eventually, they put me in the hospital for three days. While there, they ran a few tests. My blood pressure kept climbing and they kept giving me nitro sending it plummeting. It got very dangerously low at one point and the male nurse was scared to death. He said he thought he was going to lose me. He took the time to pray with me that night before he left his shift. All the nurses would run in everytime I got up to pee. They said my pulse would spike from a resting rate in the 70s to 140 or so just from standing up and walking to the restroom. I had a stress test and echo done, but everything seemed fine. They eventually sent me out with a 24 hour halter monitor.  Fast forward a few months and I am constantly in and out of the hospital with chest pain and palpitations. I had my blood pressure medicine changed several times. Had more tests ran on my heart. All the focus was entirely on it, although I still struggled greatly with dizziness and breathing difficulties. I went to one heart doctor who told me I needed a pace maker. That scared me. There didn't seem to be a real basis for such an extreme thing that I could understand but he had a really thick accent that I couldn't quite follow all of the time. I ended up going to a different heart doctor who put me on a 30 day event monitor and said the other guy must've been crazy because I was fine. I dealt with these symptoms on a daily repeat from 2009 to 2013... dizziness while driving, difficulty breathing, constantly fatigued, waking from sleep not breathing, chest pains that came on and had all the symptoms of a heart attack, dangerously high blood pressure, ridiculously low pulse, palpitations, even some strange situations with my eyes twitching and blurring and having black spots obstruct my vision. I went to sleep so many times at night wondering if I would see the next day. I was literally too scared to function, afraid to die.  I don't know what I did different if anything at all, but I had a healthy spell from late 2013 maybe (I can't be too sure when it stopped) all the way through February 2016. Oddly enough, some of those times there were the most stressful times of my life (lost our house in a storm while my wife was pregnant, had a law suit try to tear me down, got laid off by my company, etc.) but my health held up. I took it for granted barely even noticing as I'd just gotten used to it being such an occurrence. I wish I would've celebrated and held on to that feeling longer, because in February of last year, it came back stronger than ever before. I had what I thought was a heart attack at work. Came out of nowhere. I got really weak and dizzy, began to shake, my chest clenched up , I lost all breath, and my arms went numb. I blacked out in the floor for a couple of seconds before being rushed to the hospital. I've not had an easy day since then. My chest stays hurting. I've had so many doctors look at me and tests done. I can't breath well (had an 81 on a spirometry test at the ashthma doc). I wake up nightly feeling like I stopped breathing and/or having my heart jump with a feeling of electrical shock. My pulse has been very weak sometimes dropping to the mid 30's and when it gets to that, I feel I'm for sure going to die. I'm not on any beta blockers, but I am on Losartan Potassium and Amlodopine Besylate as well as a number of other things. They tried me on anxiety medicine, it never worked for me, only made things worse. This time, a slew of things have been found... I have Alpha One Antitrypsin Deficiency. I have ulcers in my stomach. I have low breathing function. Just found out I have sleep apnea. I have an extra rhythym in my heart on occassion and mild mitral valve prolapse. I have a complex benign cyst in my kidney. Most of all concerning to me, I have 5 times the maximum suggested amount of renin in my body. I have also been having my face get dry and red (apparently a case of Seborrheic Dermatitis). I've noticed this tends to precede the worst cases of my symptoms.  Still, I suffer daily and no one claims to know what exactly is going on. My blood pressure continues to stay high with the Diastolic number often being in the low 100's. My pulse continues to plummet at night. My eyes will twitch and blur. My heart will skip beats. I will get dizzy driving or playing a game or watching a movie in the theater. My arms and legs will get numb and tingly at times. I belch way too often. I wake up from mid sleep with shocks and gasps. I will bear a constant pressure and pain in my chest day in and day out. Every doctor I have just refers me to another specialist or prescribes something new. I've been left to research this mostly on my own, because I am losing hope. Here are my theories. Snoring is a tell-tell sign of sleep apnea, yet I never snore, therefore this makes me think it may be Central Sleep Apnea caused by my brain not telling my lungs to pull in air. Seborrheic Dermatitis is also sometimes caused by diseases of the Central Nervous System. Perhaps something is going on with my nerves that are causing my body to have all kinds of issues? Could it be MS? Maybe some other CNS Disease? My other theory is that there has to be a reason for my renin to be at 262.5 when the maximum is supposed to be 50 at the highest. I feel that it has to do with the complex cyst they found in my kidney, but I can’t get a doctor to actually agree to talk about removal. Renin is generally produced by the kidneys when blood pressure is low… but mine is never low. Why is there so much Renin? Could Renin be causing my blood pressure to stay skyrocketed? Could that in turn be causing other parts of my body to not function as well? I need a way through this. I’m without hope, afraid, and depressed. I have been ravaged by medical debt and my marriage is full of tension and disappointment. I can’t play with my doctor, can’t go for a walk, can’t go on a date, can’t even have sex without tons of pain and hurt. My wife wants another child, but I don’t know if I’d survive any of it. This has halted my life drastically. I can’t even get surprised or excited without having tons of pain follow suit. It’s like I get very flushed and dizzy and weak and then my heart and blood pressure go crazy. If anyone has any answers, any suggestions, anything at all… please help me. I am desperate.","High Blood Pressure , Heart Attack , Heart Disease"
Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/48926/14-year-old-female-blood-in-stool-without-discomfort,(14 Year Old Female) Blood in Stool Without Discomfort,"Hi there. As my title suggests I'm having trouble with blood in my stool. For the past three days I've been having bright red blood in my stool without any kind of discomfort such as cramping or fissures. I feel no pain during the day and it feels completely normal. The first two days I had very hard stools so I thought I was just cramping because of that, and yesterday I had a bit of pain from straining but it only lasted an hour afterwords. Today I made sure to drink a lot of water so as to see if that was the problem and the stool I passed today (I drink coffee daily so I have an almost daily BM) was loose, but still bright red. I felt completely normal passing it.  Some important things to note, recently I had my very first vaginal yeast infection and took Monistat 3 for it. On the second day after my first dose is when the problem started. I've been off Monistat for almost two days now and my infection is cleared up. Another thing is that yesterday I had a 'perceived' migraine with a mild tension headache, 'pins-and-needles' skin sensitivity mostly in my arms, and mild nausea. I took some Anacin (2 capsules, I've taken it before and haven't gotten any bad side effects). I lied down for a few hours and mostly got rid of it and woke up this morning with only the skin sensitivity and kind of an 'echo' of the headache and nausea. I took a dose of Anacin as well about 15 hours after my first dose to help with the 'postdrome'.   Sometime after my BM today I felt somewhat tight in my chest (more like my stomach feels a bit too full, not bloated, and my gut feels too empty). Within the last hour and a half I've eaten a lot of Fudge Stripes (they're very addictive), and about seven hours ago I had a salad for lunch. My diet and the things I've eaten recently always go down very well with me. Another thing to note is that I have been undergoing a high-stress situation where one of my caretakers is in the hospital and I am left to take care of the house, and just today I have started back school and it has been mentally grueling for me. I'm preparing a mild meal now to see if I can eat a bit. However I try I can't seem to relax. Maybe it's because of the Anacin, because the caffeine effect of it lasts a few hours for me, or because of my high anxiety and stress.   So, what do you think? Could the blood today just be leftover from the strain/medication from the past few days? Do I have cancer (this is WebMD after all)? I have no symptoms of blood loss (lightheadedness, pale skin, etc.) Should I see a doctor or talk to a caretaker?  Thank you for your time.",

It is a long description but I think it was important to include.  I have tried to make it as readable as possible.  My father who is 70 years old has been experiencing continuous hiccups for a year now.  This is obviously very painful as he is unable to eat or even sleep properly. After testing countless home remedies, we got him checked by medical experts about 6 months ago.  Almost all of them informed us it is due to prolonged stress, which might be true due to certain events in our lives. ********** BACKGROUND INFO ********** Age = 70 years. Ethnicity = South Asian. He has had high blood pressure and high cholesterol for more than 25 years, has been gout patient too for that amount of time. He has been obese as well for 25+ years, current weight = 245 lb, height = almost 6 feet. He also had type 2 diabetes probably for 15+ years. He can barely walk and is not active at all, mostly due to back and joint pains. He has avoided almost all meat products for 10+ years, but I think he gained weight due to more consumption of carbohydrates, specifically white flour and rice. No smoking/drinking or recreational drugs habits thankfully. He has also been experiencing cough and weakness and loss of appetite for the last 20 days or so. None of the doctors were 100% sure about the solution and prescribed the following tests and medications:  ********** TESTS DONE ********** All information is within 3 months range. -Uric Acid = 7 [normal] -All Cholesterols Total/HDL/LDL within range -Triglycerides 10-20% above normal range -ALT normal -Blood sugar controlled by 2 medicines, Glucophage and Glucobay -His ultrasound was i think normal too. -In a very recent test, it was shown his heart walls have become thick due to prolonged stress and cholesterol.  ********** DOCTORS CURRENT CONSENSUS ********** Out of the 5 doctors consulted, 2 are Cardiologists, 2 General Practitioner and a very recent one is Neurologist. Should I also consult Gastroenterologist? -Doctors ruled out existence of tumors or cancers etc based on ultrasound and long history of hiccups. Few doctors also suggested it might be GERD or acid reflux but he does not have all the symptoms. ********** ANY OTHER TESTS NEEDED? ********** I wonder now why no doctor asked to check his ""cortisol"" range? Is it not important to test to measure stress? Any other important factors to test for his stress levels? Is ENDOSCOPY really needed? No doctor so far suggested it but after researching online it seems very important? **********RECENT MEDICATIONS FOR HICCUPS********** Medications for hiccups he has been using regularly since the past 3-4 months -Motilium tablet [4 months][1+1+1 before each meal] -Nexum capsule [3 months][1+0+1 before each meal] -Gaviscon syrup [3 months] [1+0+1, 1 tbsp after each meal]  -Motival tablet [1 month][1, in the night] for stress/anxiety -RIVOTRIL for stress management prescribed by a neurologist for 3 weeks. ******OTHER DAILY LONGTERM MEDICATIONS HE TAKES REGULARLY******* These are additional medications he has to take daily for heart, blood pressure, sugar, uric acid and pain killers etc. -COEZIDAY 100mg 1x  -CAPOTIN 50mg 2x [0.25+0.25mg] -GLUCOPHANGE 500mg 1x -GLUCOBAY 50mg 1x -DISPIRIN 300mg 1x -ZYLORIC 100mg [URIC ACID] **********THE ONLY TEMPORARY REMEDY THAT WORKS********** A very temporary cure [30 minutes to 1 hour] is drinking any cola [higher the carbonation, better] while standing and bending low. Drinking warm water helps a little bit as well. Please tell me what can we do about it? This has been very painful not only to the patient but for all family members as well. I can of course provide more info if needed.  Any help will be highly appreciated. Thank you very much again.","GERD and Heartburn , Ulcers , Bloating"

Last year I was diagnosed with high blood pressure and put on 25mg of hydrochlorothiazide. Starting about 6 weeks ago my blood pressure and heart rate started spiking causing me to get dizzy, have headaches, and feel a burning in my chest, like my heart was struggling to pump blood to my body. I've been to the ER 5 times since then and every time EKG's are normal, blood is normal, and I've had one X-Ray with nothing wrong. My PCP didn't want to listen to me and said I have anxiety and put me on citalopram which made my symptoms ten times worse so I stopped taking them after 5 days. I've been put on propranolol and it's actually helped with my headaches and keep my heart rate and blood pressure under control, but I've been feeling very fatigued and weak and if I leave the house and go to the store I get dizzy and feel like I'm going to fall down, which is how I was feeling before the propranolol. At this point I feel like all I can do is lay down and feel awful. I've had poor dental health most of my life and have had quite a few untreated tooth abscesses, could I have endocarditis? I asked the RN and DR at the ER and they said it would've shown up on the EKG and it didn't. I get a sensation in my chest that feels like my heart or something by my heart is swollen and protruding from my chest, like there's a patch or something under my shirt on my skin. I've also had pain in my left shoulder, neck, back and arm the last few days. Sometime's It's felt like I have a lump or food in my throat. I have an appointment with a cardiologist in a week, I'm going to ask for and echo and/or angiogram just to be sure.

My heart was monitored up until the age of 7 when the VSD had closed enough to not be considered harmful (the size of the tip of a ball-point pen). I had not had my heart checked again from that point and did not end up getting any surgery to close the VSD. My irregular heartbeat and murmur stayed with me my whole life and I later developed asthma around the age of 10, the doctor at the time said that it was likely related to my heart condition.  I have had a few episodes that have resulted with me in the hospital over my childhood-teen years that felt like massive heart pains and chest pains, but were always diagnosed as panic attacks.  I am now 24 and I do feel like my heart doesn't work the same as people around me, I tend to have a high resting heart rate (90-100 bpm), my blood-pressure is usually average and I have asthma attacks when I exert myself (high intensity sports, sexual activity, etc.). I decided to go to a cardiologist to get my heart looked at just to make sure everything was still okay.  The doctor did an EKG and an echo-cardiogram, he said that he found a very small membranous ventricular septal defect, but that he did not hear any when he listened. He said that I should be fine because my heart was shaped properly and appeared to be functioning regularly. No other tests were done and he said that I should be at no risk and that I could live my life without worry of my heart. He also recommend I get it rechecked in about 5-10 years.  I am just wondering if I should get a second opinion because there were no physical tests (or tests that required any strain on my heart) to see if I was at any risk. Is it possibly for the doctor to tell just from 2 resting tests that I am safe to engage in physical activity without precautions?",Heart Disease

I have always worn a condom no matter who I have sex with. I know condoms aren’t 100% full proof against STDs but they help. About a week and a half ago I had vagina sex with someone different. My penis went into her vagina at the beginning of sex twice for about 5 seconds, each time without a condom. I stopped and insisted I needed a condom. Again never had sex without one until then, for those few short seconds. So I put the condom on and we had sex. Came in the condom in her. A week and a half goes by and she tells me we need to talk and she tells me she has been having cramps and it burns when she pees.

I've been getting them ever since about age 3, and have developed ways to prevent them. However, I would like to learn more about them and why they happen. So far doctors have not been able to figure out exactly what it is. Maybe someone on here can help? Here's how they go down: I'll get a stomach ache or headache. It won't go away or get better no matter what I do. Eventually, I sort of zone out for a few seconds and come back realizing something is wrong. Everything becomes blurry like my life is running at 3 frames per second, and my thinking isn't very clear. At this point I know I'm about to have a seizure (it's my aura I guess you could say). This happens for about 10-30 seconds, then I faint. I wake up and it's like in a movie, I hear people saying my name (in echoes), there's ringing in my ears, vision is blurry, and my eyes are sensitive to light. Then, I just throw up. Repeatedly. There hasn't been any magic fix, just time and sleep. Usually it takes about a week to fully recover from these episodes. Sometimes I get multiple episodes in a day (Max I've had is 3-4 in a few hours). I don't shake or anything, and I wasn't sure it was a seizure until it happened once in front of some doctors. They said it was definitely a seizure. In the ambulance once, just from throwing up (no episode) they said my heart skipped 3-4 beats. That can't be good. So far what I've found out causes this is food dyes, (Red 40, Blue 30, etc), and stress (bleeding and stuff). Maybe it's just an anxiety reaction? Possibly the food dyes make me sick and I panic.

Everything came back normal except my cholesterol LDL levels at 5.1 mmol/L, which was already somewhat elevated back in 2012 at 4.2 mmol/L. I'm male, 43yrs old, but I would consider myself relatively healthy. I'm 5'7 and weigh 145-150lbs, exercise at the gym for 1hour with weights twice a week and play volleyball for 2-3hours twice a week. My diet is also fairly decent although I do consume more meat than veggies, as well I tend to snack on chips a fair bit. I don't believe there is a history of elevated cholesterol in my family as my grand parents lived to an old age (75-80) and did not pass away from heart attack or stroke, although my father passed away fairly young due to pulmonary fibrosis. My questions are:  1. Is my LDL level correct or accurately reflect my elevated risk of cardiac risk of heart attack or stroke?  2. Could my high LDL be due to Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) as my doctor suspects or is it diet, which I don't think is that bad?  3. Is it possible to have low-to-reasonable body fat 12-15% and near text book blood pressure of 120/80 and still be at high risk of cardiac disease/heart attacks/stroke?

I respect my doctors and other medical professionals immensely, but I am genuinely desperate. In October (about 5 months ago) I visited my PCP after feeling sickly for weeks on end. I had been having low-grade fevers on a daily basis, joint pain and general aches, and fatigue so bad I would sleep for 16 hours. My blood work came back with normal CBC, but positive for mono. I was given prednisone (which did nothing) and told I would feel better in a week or two. 5 months later, my symptoms have only gotten worse. With my fevers come a bright red butterfly shaped rash across my face, and I am often too sick to get out of bed. I visited the doctor once again, who agreed that the fevers were not likely caused by the mono I had five months ago. She thought there was a chance of an autoimmune condition, so tested my ANA, CRP, CBC, ESR, and for lyme (for good measure). Yet, every single test came back within the normal range. I had been treated for kidney pain recently as well, but all that showed up in my urine was a little protein and white blood cells (but not an amount too excessive). With having tested negative for lupus, lyme, and any sort of infection, I do not know what to think. My fevers have not subsided, and the rash on my face shows up a few times a week at least (it's not itchy, just hot). I also continuously break out in hives, despite having had allergy testing (not sure if this is related). If I don't have an autoimmune condition, lyme, mono, or any infection, why on earth am I feeling so sick and what can I do to feel better? I feel like I have tried everything, and I eat and exercise well. Even pain meds do a poor job of relieving my symptoms. If anyone has any ideas on what I can do to feel better or what the issue is, it would be greatly appreciated.",

I'm a 35 year old male, non-smoker, light drinker (maybe 2 beers a week), overweight but not to the point of serious medical concern. Four times in the past week I've had this onset of pain that follows the exact same process each time... Out of nowhere, I get a very sharp, stabbing pain localized to the centre of the chest (i.e. right where you figure your heart is), it lasts for maybe 2 seconds, sends a shooting pain up to the back of my neck, then disappears completely. I'll take a deep breath, it might hurt a bit, but on the second breath the pain is totally gone, then I'll get a little dew of sweat on my forehead. And that's it. Everything goes back to normal. I play on a couple of sports teams, and this pain has never happened during periods of heavy exertion. These little onsets of pain last no more than a few seconds, but they come out of nowhere (always during a period of rest - three times while driving, once while just standing and chatting). And they leave me rattled because the pain is intense for those few seconds, and I have not experienced this before. I'm going to make an appointment with my GP just to let him know about it, but since the pain subsides so quickly I'm pretty certain he'll diagnose it as a musculo-skeletal or nerve thing. Just checking to see if anybody else has experienced this and if they ever found anything out about it. Thanks!",

I have a couple of friends l made in Zimbabwe and we had a night out at a bar and brothel in Harare 3 days ago. I had a couple of drinks and l danced with a prostitute. We went to the back rooms and l started to finger her. I usually bite my nails. I fingered her and then she got a condom and put it on me. Since l was struggling to maintain an erection l had difficulty in actually having sex with her and at times l would not properly penetrate and she had to guide me I, in 1 or 2 minutes l ejaculated and she got my penis out rolled off the condom and wiped me off with a tissue. She rolled me on another condom and l tried to have a second round but failed as l was not erect and decided to end it all. I have been having nightmares and anxiety and stress for the last couple of days. I was not fully erect on both occasions and on the last round the condom slipped a bit to cover about half the penis as l was not hard  but l am sure the head of the penis was covered. My foreskin never rolled back on both instances and we did not have rigorous sex with little penetration as l was not hard. I am now scared about catching HIV from this one time encounter and scared because l also fingered her the entire time putting my fingers and pulling them out frequently but not for long. I am reaaly scared l went to a doctor on Monday morning and he said l was at no risk at all and there was no need to put me up on PEPs. He recommended that if l need peace of mind l come through in 2 weeks time and have a test done for HIV. He says that test will be conclusive. He said there was also no risk for stis given the encounter but if need be l will have tests done for stis in 2 weeks too although l will have another test for stis at 4 weeks after exposure to conclude.  My questions are:  1. Did l get HIV from this encounter or other STIs l never kissed her that l am sure just played with one boob only. There was little body contact and l was on top of her the entire time.  2. The doctor said there are now advanced tests which detect HIV at 2 weeks and they are conclusive if l take it there is little need for a retest. What is your take.  3. I haven't had any symptoms as yet but l been checking myself at every opportunity l get.  4 The doctor also said these prostitutes are also afraid of hiv and they try to be safe always and so the risk is little if she had me use condoms as they are experienced in condom use.

Since the past 6 months, I've been having quite a bit of issues with my digestive system. Most of the other issues seem to have passed, but I'm still left with this one: Moderate pain on the lower right side of my stomach when sleeping on my right side.  This all started with a worsening of my reflux symptoms (which I've had on and off for at least the last 10 years or so). Terrible heart burn, lot of bloating, gurgling stomach sounds and lower right abdomen pain. Few days after the reflux went nuts, I also developed a diarrhea and low grade fever jumping between 37.5 - 38 Celcius (99.5 - 100.5 Fahrenheit). At that point, I went to a doctor and had some blood work done plus was tested for Helicobacter pylori. All came back normal (and negative for h. pylori). After physical exam, history and the test results, doctor gave me the diagnosis of IBS. Fast forward to this day. The good part is, my reflux and other stomach problems seem to be ""ok"" now, but I'm still left with this weird problem at night time. Like said, the pain only comes to surface when I'm laying on my right side in bed. When I switch my sleeping position to sleeping on back or on my right side, the pain disappears. The pain is always on the same place, right lower quadrant of my stomach. I believe it's right about the same place where appendix is.  The pain is almost always accompanied with gas and if I press on the spot where it hurts, there are audible gurgling sounds present. My questions are:  - Does anyone else experience the same thing (whether you have IBS or not)? - And if you do, have you (or your doctor) been able to figure out what's causing it? - Is there something that I can try to make it go away? I'm just clueless as to why this is happening now, because for the past 36 years, I certainly have not experienced this before. Any ideas and tips appreciated! --- (Image: Blausen.com staff (2014).

I had an echo cardiogram because of heart palpitations (that turned out to be panic attacks and went away, except during an attack). The echo said the structure of my heart was normal, and my ejection fraction was 58%, but that my RVSP was 36mmhg with trivial mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. My doctor told me it was a normal echo, and didn't even say anything about it. I saw the number on my own and got concerned (to put it mildly), as the Internet seems to think it's suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. I've had severe anxiety since childhood, and after going through health records, noticed I also had an echo done when I was 17 yrs. old, 10 years ago, that had a similar RVSP of 37. That was also said to be normal, but they didn't know any regurgitation on that one. Since the number is basically the same, am i likely fine? Wouldn't PAH symptoms have shown up by now? I admit that I am also about 70 pounds overweight...I was less so at 17, but still overweight...I am trying to lose it, but wonder if this would affect it, too.

Then last week I was just checking my phone and went to inhale in my left rib I got a sharp pain felt like a heart burn in my rib (I had these pains before in past happen seldomly and last seconds to a min MAX) when it happens I just cannot inhale deeply as it feels like it's ripping and it's so painful I just rubbed it but this time it didn't go away for the whole day. Some say it's air idk. Also when I workout I have to becareful because my chest will hurt and my heart will over accelerate easy.

While my penis is flaccid I'm able to fully retract the foreskin well past the head of my penis without pain or discomfort. However, when I'm erect and I try to retract my foreskin it only goes down to the corona of my penis head. If I try to pull it down any further, it begins to hurt and my frenulum appears strained. As a result my foreskin bunches up at the corona (under the head of my penis) and that's as far as it can go. Also, when I'm flaccid my foreskin is able to roll forward over the head normally, but when I stop retracting the foreskin to roll it forward while I'm erect it only goes back halfway up the penis head and stops rolling forward. The only way I'm able to fully roll forward the foreskin is to wait until it becomes flaccid again. My main concern is that it would not be optimal during sex. and it might break the frenulum or tear the foreskin whenver I try to participate in intercourse. Does anyone know if this is normal or not? If it isn't normal, could there be a way to fix my problem? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

For the past 6 months I have had a burning/stinging sensation in the tip of my penis and foreskin. Let me first say that I highly doubt this is a STD because I have only been sexually active with my wife in the past 12 years (and we were both virgins when we met). About 6 months ago my wife and I had unprotected intercourse (she was 7 months pregnant at the time). A few days after, I noticed a couple of bumps under my foreskin; I scratched them. A couple days after that the same patch of skin turned red and began to burn and now I also had stinging in the tip of my penis. I went to my GP who told be to try Lotrimin, which I did for a couple weeks with no results. I went back and he prescribed me an oral anti-fungal which appeared to help things a little bit but ultimately the stinging came back. My GP thought that it may be nerve issues and prescribed me Gabapentin(sp?), which hasn’t helped either. Finally, I asked for a referral to a Urologist, who told me that he could see no cause for concern and basically told me to”wait it out”.  The weird thing about this is, to look at my penis, there is no appearance of any real issue (though the pain is always present) unless I were to touch the foreskin and irritate it a little. The hole of my penis looks slightly red and inflamed to me. Does anyone know what this could be? Pain in the penis tip and left side only? My follow up appointment isn’t until January and I can’t live with this for much longer. Thanks!",

Heart Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/8471/stimulant-use-post-bypass-surgery,Stimulant use post-bypass surgery,"I am in my early 40s and suffered a heart attack/cardiac arrest and coded for 15 minutes. Although I had no previous arrhythmia problems, I went into Vfib after doctors were forced to use the defibrillator. I had a 100% LAD blockage, 90% circumflex blockage, and around 50-60% RCA blockage. I underwent a quadruple bypass and recovery went better than expected. I also have severe ADHD. After being back to work for about a month, my PCP decided that he was no longer comfortable writing a prescription for Vyvanse (30 mg) any longer although there were no related problems. Talking to other doctors, it seems that I'm at very little risk for arrhythmia (although there is some increased risk). However, that seems to have started a chain reaction and now no one wants to actually write the prescription. The cardiologist states that he won't sign off on it because of the FDA warning so I went to a psychiatrist who won't write it without cardiologist approval (although he initially agreed there is little risk). I seriously cannot function without this medication and may not have a job for long without it. I am a few pounds overweight (BMI under 30), work a sedentary job, and could eat a little better, but I was generally healthy prior to this. I have no history of alcohol or drug abuse. I've also been very cooperative in trying other ""treatments"" although I've tried most before.? I understand that stimulant use isn't ideal for me but I can't find any studies or other information that demonstrates a significant additional risk. Question 1- Am I really at any substantially increased risk of arrhythmia or other heart-related problems?  Question 2- If I'm not at a significantly increased risk, how do I go about getting this prescription? I've been told (by healthcare professionals) that because there are notes in ""the system"", that other doctors have declined to write it, I would likely have to go to another health system and be less than honest about my history in order to get someone to write this prescription. Is that really my best option? Thanks for reading and for any advice or information that anyone can offer.","Heart Attack , Heart Disease"

Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/458/i-though-i-was-dying,I Though I Was Dying,"I am a 26 year old male. It all started when I was 18 years old graduating from high school. I began to have abdominal pain and minor bouts of diarrhea. I thought it was just a virus or just going through a phase, but after a month I had enough and went in to see a gastroenterologist. I had blood tests run, an ultrasound of my adbdomen, and finally a colonoscopy. After all the tests my doctor said that I had “minor” IBS and that I would be fine. After speaking with the doctor I felt better knowing that I would be fine but in the back of my head I knew something was not right.  I went off to college for 5 years and the symptoms continued to get worse and worse, I saw a few other doctors along the way and they said that it is just the IBS you are “fine” just cut back on drinking and eating junk food/bad food. It got to the point towards the end of college where if I went out drinking than I would have extreme pain in the abdomen area/bad diarrhea so I began to cut back on the drinking and bad foods. Also my stools slowly started to become loose. I began to just not be myself and I knew something was wrong in the back of my head. But what more could I do besides a colonoscopy? I also started to experience frequent urination that got worse over time and also muscle spasms and heart palpitations that also got worse. My doctor said it was just “stress” and told me to cut back on any caffeine you may be consuming.  These symptoms progressively got worse over time but I was still able to live a moderately normal life until one day about a year after I graduated from college. At about 1:00AM in the morning I remember waking up from sleeping on the couch and quickly walking to bed. As soon as I laid down on my stomach I suddenly felt very light headed and queezy. I got very faint, my heart rate shot to what felt like 150bpm, I was sweating profusely, had scary heart palpitations, and I thought this was it my life was ending tonight. I got very close to passing out but never lost consciousness. My girlfriend at the time rushed me to the hospital and they did blood work and a cat scan of my head. I spent about half the night there and at the end of it the doctor said that I was free to leave and thought it was probably stress that triggered it and gave me no explanation. After that day I started noticing awful reactions to certain foods like sugar, white carbs, alcohol, eating excessively, and even exercise. I was having awful heart palpitations, feeling dizzy, was not able to think clearly, my lymph nodes became swollen and would get worse after eating the above referenced foods, and my heart would randomly jump to 130-15bpm. I got random bouts of dizziness after changing elevations quickly.  One day for lunch at work about a week after the first trip to the ER I consumed one single beer and immediately I started feeling dizzy and wound up going to the emergency room again that night. The same symptoms as the first trip to the ER happened and the doctor ended up saying basically the same thing. By the way it has been about a year since that second trip to the ER and I have not had a single drink since then. Shortly after the first trip to the ER I began seeing several doctors. The first doctor I saw was my general practitioner. He did extensive blood work and said everything looked normal and that it was probably stress and he recommended me to a cardiologist, endocrinologist, and even a psychologist! The second one I saw was a cardiologist in which I had a stress test done, several EKG’s, too much blood work, and also an ultrasound of my heart. Everything checked out fine and he said it was probably just “stress” you were experiencing and that you just need to relax. I proceeded to see another cardiologist and had the same tests done in which he told me that it was again just stress and that I was fine. Now I moved on to see two endocrinologists in which I did all the blood work in the world it felt like. I got tested for thyroid problems and everything and I got the same response from all the other doctors. I proceeded to see a gastroenterologist where he did extensive blood work and tested for chrons, any inflammation and various other diseases. I told him everything and he literally told me to take pepto bismol and that I was fine. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. At this point all I wanted was a doctor to give me some concrete answers and tell me something besides stress is causing all of this. On to another gastroenterologist. I went to the Medical Center in Houston, TX one of the best hopitals in the country. They did a stool sample, a cat scan of my abdomen, and extensive blood work. After all those tests they said everything was normal and that you’re symptoms were over a broad range of organ systems so they basically could not give me any answers. I have seen 7 doctors in 3 months at this point but hey who is counting. After eating anything at this point I just don’t feel right. My symptoms after seeing the 7th doctor include: heart palpitations, muscle spasms, swollen lymph nodes(gets worse after eating), tight chest(gets after eating), loose stools, occasional diarrhea, brain fog, loss of appetite, constipation, dizziness after sudden elevation changes, sleep loss, ringing in ears, and loss of weight. I went from being 175 pounds to 140 pounds without even trying. All of these symptoms get worse after eating, especially after sugar, junk food, starches, and alcohol. The only thing that made me feel slightly better was keeping an extremely strict diet. The more I researched the more I thought that this was a gastro related nervous system disorder so I saw a neurologist and he said that the gut is lined by the nervous system and that I had an extremely over reactive gut. He prescribed me clonazepam’s and said this would help calm my gut. I thought this was the last thing I wanted because I thought it would probably make me worse or it would just be a band-aid and not cover the real issues at hand. Nonetheless I took them for a few weeks to just try and keep sane because I was desperate and then got off of them quickly. They did not solve any real problems.  	It has been almost a year now since that first trip to the emergency room and my symptoms have gotten slightly better but they are still there and the only things that have helped me has been to keep an extremely strict diet. Right not all I want is some answers. I try hard to keep a positive attitude but sometimes it is extremely hard and I get really down on myself. All of my friends seem so happy and healthy and I cannot say the same for myself. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? This is not stress or IBS we are talking about here. Please if there is anyone out there that has any insight to what is going on with me or a possible doctor referral that could help me out please email me at nml606@icloud.com. I apologize for the lengthy post but I can not go my whole life without knowing what is wrong with me.

My first visit they took a blood test and stool test and found no issues except that I had lost 8 lbs. Around this time I had to use the bathroom, to be specific I needed to poop 5-6 times daily. I also had extremely sudden urges. My stool was very loose and when I didn’t use it I would cramp up. Each time I did use the bathroom there would be blood as well. As time went on I visited a specialist and I took a blood and stool test. They said that i have high liver enzymes and had lost weight. Right now I am 95 lbs. My stool has been better but there has been blood still and bloody mucus. I do feel discomfort sometimes after I use it but it is not painful at all.

While I'm now able to achieve an erection without medication, my erections aren't the same. At the base, the shaft of my penis is quite smaller (girth) and narrower, and while further up the shaft, around my circumcision scar is still the normal girth, it's cocked (no pun intended) slightly to the right and about 1"" to 2"" shorter.

I've eaten the same thing every single day for over 6 months because although I'm in pain every single day of my life other things tend to make it worse. Basically some carbs are safe, no vegetables, no protein, no fats. I eat oatmeal all day if it gets really bad, but I will still be in pain if I do so. Drinking water makes the pain worse. I haven't left my apartment in over a month because I have stabbing pain from walking. My BMs are very very dark and I usually go 2-3 days with nothing and then have diarrhea. Two days ago I had to go to the ER because of the pain...but was told I should take a walk and have tylenol lol? Here's my pain diary:    Rash:   (they come and go, the itchy part is just where my IV was, the other bumps aren't itchy) My doctors say my blood/ urine tests are normal, but my white blood cell count is 7.40 and my leucocyte esterase is 250 (I can post my full blood/urine tests if needed- I had two done). They also said my ultrasound is normal with a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis and mild postvoid residual volume. I'm having a HIDA scan on Monday. I was meant to have a colonoscopy and the doctor who was going to do it said the pain is ""normal for women"" so I walked out. My Xray said I have scoliosis. No blood in stool. Those are all the tests I've had. I take digestive enzymes and probiotics. I'm currently waiting to see a GI and am first in line if someone cancels an appointment.",

I have been on 40 mg Nexium since 5/2017 for GERD and LPR. I started slowly cutting down November 2017. I am currently on 30 mg Nexium and really struggling. I don’t have heartburn or voice issues again, but I have a dull ache between my shoulder blades. It has gotten worse and worse the more I cut down on the Nexium. Sometimes it is almost debillitating and I feel scared of esophagus issues. Sometimes the pain goes up to my neck and down my back. I am currently taking mastic gum between meals, 75 mg ranitidine, chewing DGL licorice, taking digestive enzymes, and drinking aloe vera juice before meals. I am on a probiotic and drinking apple cider vinegar in water twice per day. I have tried dietary changes and have recently given up sugary sweets. I am drinking alkaline water.  My question is, should I be worried about the nearly constant dull ache between my shoulder blades or is this a normal part of acid rebound? If it’s normal, I can persevere through the pain and keep cutting down on that horrid PPI. Has anyone else dealt with this? I am considering making an appointment with my PCP, but they always say I should increase my PPI as high as possible. I am tired of drugs. I am only 37 years old. I have tried getting off PPIs once before in 2016 and it worked for awhile, but then I had shooting pain in my back and chest. I got scared at that point and started up again and increased from 20 mg to 40 mg per my PCP’s instructions. I have been on and off Nexium and Omeprazole off and on since 2015. I have had 2 endoscopies. The one in 2015 showed a small hiatal hernia and mild gastritis and the one in 2017 did not show a hernia and looked pretty good.

Before I tell you about their benefits, let me show you how easy it is to get probiotics. These helpful bacteria can be found in many places. The easiest way to locate the source is the plain, unflavored yogurt. If you have lactose intolerance or an in any way sensitive to it, then try kefir, another great source of probiotics. And if you are vegan, then you can choose among pickles, sour kraut, tempeh, miso, kimchi and kombucha tea. The benefits of probiotics for your gut health are the most well known. Doctors prescribe them to repopulate your gut with the helpful bacteria while you are taking a course of antibiotics, for example. That's because probiotics help reduce diarrhea and diarrhea is a very common side effect of taking antibiotics. The probiotics are also helpful in alleviating the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). These symptoms include bloating, constipation and gas, but a cup of yogurt a day can keep patients regular. Speaking of antibiotics, ladies you are already warned about their harmful effect on your vagina's delicate environment. Birth control pills have the same effect, but if you are prone to yeast infections or UTIs (urinary tract infections), you may start adding more probiotics to your diet, as preliminary research show they help with these issues as well. You probably know already that yogurt is one of the most recommended foods when keeping a diet. Preliminary research shows that probiotics can help obese patients maintain weight loss after they have had weight loss surgery. More so, mothers can also benefit from probiotics, which assist them to reduce the waist circumference post-partum. Recent research also suggests that probiotics help in lowering the cholesterol, thus contributing to reduce blood pressure and avoid further health problems. Speaking of heart disease, did you know that poor oral hygiene is associated with heart problems and a host of other issues? But don't worry. Probiotics also help you keep your pearly whites in good shape. A certain strain of probiotics kills the bacteria which causes tooth decay and also helps lessen the effects of gingivitis. If you have already probiotics to your diet, you may have noticed that you are less prone to get sick every time the season's change (or the wind blows). Research shows that one of the benefits of probiotics is reducing the upper respiratory infections. Since I first discovered the true power of probiotics some time ago, I feel excellent, and it is my duty to spread the word.

I am 30 years old and have had high blood pressure since my early 20's. I stopped smoking because of my hypertension but decided i wanted to smoke again. when i did i don't know if it was an anxiety attack that i got or if my blood pressure just went up too high but i felt like i had to take deep breaths and felt discomfort in my chest. it lasted for a few minutes and then went away on its own. I am wondering if marijuana makes my blood pressure go up or if it keeps it down. i have read many different answers from different places i have researched. obviously i don't want to keep smoking if it makes my blood pressure go up. i am currently taking lisinopril for my blood pressure. i have heard that smoking marijuana does make blood pressure go up for a bit after smoking it but after an hour or so it actually lowers blood pressure. marijuana use is not something i proud of but something i enjoy doing on certain occasions. not every day all day. haven't talked to my doctor about it either. i am due to see a cardiologist in a few weeks and i will ask him/ her but in the mean time i wanted some feed back from other people that perhaps have hypertension and smoke marijuana.,High Blood Pressure

I was born early in the 90’s at 31 weeks and diagnosed with acid reflux a few months after I was born due to failure to gain weight from being unable to keep milk down. I was on zantac as a young child for it as well but it never controlled it very well and often got sick. Stomach pain, heart burn, vomiting and dizziness. I don’t remember the exact age or why I went off of the medication as a kid but somewhere in there I did. I had a few years were it seemed as if I was better but around my early teens I suffered from severe vomiting, acid regurgitation, stomach pains, heartburn and dizziness. I was put back on zantac after they checked my gallbladder out and two-three months later was immediately removed from it as it made my symptoms almost worse. Clearly H2 blockers aren’t for me. I was put on Omeprazole 20mg once a day and bam! Good as new. But as the years went on, I found the food I could tolerate becoming less and less full of variety and in 2014, due to symptoms coming back. Mainly acid constantly in the back of my throat. I compared it to downing a shot of whiskey and lightning it on fire. Not that much fun to be honest. I was upped to 20mg twice a day and that almost immediately fixed me. But again, the foods I could tolerate became less and less till I hit a point I was only eating cheese, bread, graham crackers, skinless chicken breast, low fat turkey and potatoes. I am not kidding. I drank a plain soda from time to time but nothing else too risky or fun. Then this entire year it seemed as if the meds stopped controlling my gerd as well as they did in the beginning. I finally got so dizzy and nauseous I was barely able to function. I was switching off Omeprazole and to Nexium 40mg once a day. Again. Over a month passed but unlike before when my meds were upped, it didn’t fix me. It made them more tolerable but I still felt and feel horrible. Currently on 40mg twice a day. The acid regurgitation is pretty well controlled but I’ve been having stomach pain. My actual stomach. Severe chest pain at times. Sometimes it feels as if food is getting stuck on the way down. Not in my throat but about halfway down my chest, where the front of my bra is. Sometimes it feels as if my stomach is being stabbed or if I haven’t ate in days, even if I ate twenty minutes ago. I get nauseous and dizzy from time to time. Sometimes I swear I’m even having heart palpitations but I have anxiety so it’s hard to say if it’s from that or just nerves from feeling so ill. I get full quite quickly and no matter how little or how slow I eat, I often find my stomach feeling extremely full and like its half in my chest, almost. I get severe stomach pain throughout the day at random times that ranges from uncomfortable to me in the fetal position crying. I’ve had two doctors, my regular doctor and my GI (which I’ve been referred to last month. Saw her. An endoscopy was ordered but cannot get in until late December.) I adore my doctors and trust them immensely but a possible hiatal hernia has been mentioned before and at this stage, I am quote curious. I truly believe with my symptoms I have Gerd and a hiatal hernia or possibly just a hiatal hernia that is causing the gerd. I was premed in College before I took another route in life but I am rather curious. Does it seem like a hiatal hernia, gerd or both? I’ve had surgery mentioned due to H2 blockers not something I’m able to tolerate and I’ve tried five different PPI’s at this point and nothing is controlling it to a point that I am able to work. Employers tend to not look too happy at the prospect of hiring an ill employee who multiple times a day has to lie down due to stomach nausea and pain. Any and all thoughts welcome!  Currently I am taking Nexium 40mg twice a day. Avoiding all trigger foods and beverages and have been for years. Only water is drank. Current diet is plain oatmeal with a banana in the morning. A plain turket sandwich at lunch and a baked potato with salt and another sandwich for dinner. I sleep sitting up or on my left side. I am exercising to lose weight almost every single day. I do not smoke nor drink alcohol and never have. My symptoms are chest pain, severe at times. Stomach pain. Feeling as if food is getting caught in my chest at times. Early satiety, postprandal fullness, feeling as if my stomach is in my chest at times. Sometimes I feel short of breathe after I eat, as if my lungs don’t have enough room to expand properly. Sometimes I get heart flutters/palpitations but again, that might just be anxiety related possibly. Burping for no reason, even after just taking a sip of water. Sometimes my breath smells bad and I have a bad taste in my back of my throat. An ulcer hasn’t been completely ruled out but due to my history with gerd the GI doctor seems to think an ulcer is not the main cause and gerd or a hiatal hernia could be.

Heart condition ?,"Hi guys,  I am 37 years old and haven't smoked or drank alcohol since 1st April and I am 5'11 and 187 lbs.  I have started working out after many years. For the past 2-3 weeks, I have just been doing casual exercises, sometimes on a recumbent bike or walking on a treadmill or some weight training without a standard program.  On each of these occasions, whether on a recumbent bike or a treadmill or moderate weight training, after 15-20 minutes I have been belching continuously and having mild difficulty in breathing.  I thought it was my mistake as I used to drink a glass of milk or have some bananas 30 minutes before a workout and while belching I can make out its the undigested milk or bananas.  Today, I decided to do a proper workout seriously without any preworkout food. A full body workout with one exercise for each body part ( 6 body parts * 3 sets) and by the end of the workout I was belching pretty heavily.  I somehow rushed out of the gym and while walking home, I was really disoriented. Difficulty in breathing and complete discomfort, I thought I was going to have a heart attack or just collapse.  I had completed my lunch at 2.30 pm and did the workout at 6.00 pm, there was no preworkout food this time and my weight training was less than 30 minutes.  I somehow reached home and there was a massive burp and then I started feeling ok but the incident has left me in fear.  I will obviously get my heart checked but I am would like your opinion on this.  Is my low cardio efficiency the culprit here ?

She was 53 years old. Paramedics resuscitated her after 45 minutes. The hospital cooled and rewarmed her body to try and eliminate brain damage on the chance that she'd wake up (2/3 doctors I spoke to said survival was minimal). After the cooling, rewarming, and sedation wore off, my Mom never woke up. An EEG picked up seizures but was otherwise unresponsive. She was taken off life support and moved to hospice. She died 3 days later. If my Mom was considerably brain dead, what was keeping her alive those last 3 days without a ventilator, etc? Also, a few days before the cardiac arrest she'd had excessive nausea which we both attributed to her colon cancer surgery (she'd had a colon resection 9 months prior) and frequently suffered from chronic pain and nausea. Her lab reports from her stay in CCU last week tell me she was critically low on potassium and magnesium and critically high on calcium, AND tested positive for E. Coli in her urine. She was suffering with pain the last few months of her life (using a walker, too) but had never mentioned chest pains to me. Anytime in the past few years she'd had her heart tested, everything came back healthy. She sometimes had anxiety attacks. I just don't know how this could have happened.  I performed CPR before paramedics arrived but deep down I knew she wouldn't make it and feel like she ""died"" the moment she collapsed. This all just happened in the last 10 days and I'm desperate for answers. Thanks in advance.","AFib , Heart Failure , Heart Attack , Heart Disease"

I noticed my scrotum and the bottom half of my penis were very dry and started to flake off. Two days passed, and this opaque thick white stuff appeared on my testicles and had a not so pleasant smell. I took a shower, and all the dryness I experienced was gone (I though maybe the skin peeled itself off). However, this happened again a few days ago. I took a shower again and it was gone. About two days ago, I decided to buy an over the counter anti fungal cream (Lotrimin). I thought the opaque white stuff was some thing like a yeast infection or scrotal dermatitis because I tuck (look it up) my penis daily for 24+ hours a day (on top of when I work out), so I thought the very moist environment of my genitals being squished together caused this. The same day I bought the anti fungal cream, a red non painful bump appeared on the base of my penis. I just assumed it was part of the yeast/jock itch thing.  However, I started to look up different STD's and I am scared it could be more than just a yeast/jock itch/scrotal dermatitis infection. I should say I did have oral sex with two guys about 3 or 4 weeks ago, but they had been tested in july/early august. As well as, I did not swallow any of their fluids. However, I gave the oral sex, and I do not have any sores in my mouth that I can see or feel. So, I am confused, if I do have an STD, how it would have gotten down there.

In Oct of 2016 I had my very first panic attack but initially thought it was heart related. Had used chewing tobacco for the longest time and thought it was the end of me when I had a chest muscle twitch. I checked myself in to the ER a few days later and followed up with a cardiologist the following week and again 2 months later for a stress test. Took me 15 min to get my heart rate up to 164 BPM on the stress test treadmill. My blood pressure is always around 120-133 over 79-82. Also I should mention that I am an avid runner, marathoner, cross fitter, etc.. I was convinced, prior to the test, that I had some sort of underlying heart issue or my poor tobacco decision had ruined me health-wise. I aced the stress test in the cardiologist's eyes and I had ease of mind for about a month. BTW - I have no significant family history with heart disease. My grandfather had a heart attack at age 52 and was an avid smoker and my uncle survived a stroke around the age of 55.  Then I started having some of the similar symptoms back when I had my anxiety/panic attack and I don't know what the heck is considered stress/anxiety symptoms, and what is considered a potential heart issue... Sometimes when I have too much caffeine I get hyper-sensitive to any involuntary movement my upper body makes.  For example, my jaw muscles get really tense like I had just been chewing on a bag of skittles or box of JuJy Fruits candy but I get no neck pain and eventually it goes away. I also grind my teeth at night so maybe the muscles are tightening from the caffeine?? Off the caffeine symptoms, I'll get a slight pain in the left side of by back like someone has their knuckle in my back muscle just to the left of my spine. It doesn't hurt to breathe, just annoying when I feel it.  The most annoying/questionable symptom I have is when my left arm begins to feel like someone is tugging on it. It doesn't hurt when I touch my forearm, shoulder, or any part of my arm. I sleep on my left side too with my arm under my wife's pillow the right of me, so if you can envision that..? Maybe my arm is just sore from my sleeping position all the time? I used to sleep on my right side before we moved to a new house and changed sides of the bed LOL! But never noticed pain in my right arm when I slept on my right side..  When I get these symptoms I try and remember that I aced my stress test, I'm healthy and young, but for any of those that can relate.. it is hard to ignore the physical symptoms when they're constantly there! And to be honest, I'm mentally thinking ""Ok here it comes, here it is.. here it comes.."" about some sort of heart issue about 8 hours of the day.  So am I really insane?!? What else does someone want to hear, if anything, to get a better idea? Anyone else having the same issues/symptoms, or have explanations? Can stress really beat me up like this and have heart-like symptoms? I'm to the point now where I don't want to even eat any eggs or spicy foods because I'm afraid my cholesterol is high, even though blood work is perfect, and might stroke out! I mean..

(cardiac arrest or pulmonary embolism),"My mother-in-law died next last week. She was 68 and sitting next to me in the backseat of the car, on the way to a special dinner with the whole family. She was laughing and talking, and had been active with no mention of pain or symptoms just moments before. She obviously started to notice that something was wrong, asked that the car be pulled over, and asked for some water. She said 'my heart', tried to take a sip of water, couldn't and then said 'my heart' again before she collapsed. We were already pulled over and started calling 911 immediately. Within 5-6 minutes two doctors had arrived (one who someone had run to get from a nearby clinic and one who happened to be driving by). She was unconscious but making a snoring sound at first. My sister-in-law had cleared her mouth immediately and supported her head. Because of a mix-up with 911 we got put on hold, had to call back, and the ambulance didn't arrive until at least 15 minutes later. They proceeded to try to reanimate her for almost half an hour, certainly beyond the point of any reasonable hope. There was no autopsy, but they said it was almost certainly either a cardiac arrest or a pulmonary embolism. I didn't belive she was dead, because the ECG (?) showed movement, but apparently it wasn't in all of her ventricles/not circulating? My father-in-law remembered later that he had an epi-pen in the car, but was too in shock to even think about it at the time. What are the chances that, if he had thought to give the epi-pen to one of the doctors, or try to use it himself before they got there, or if there had not been a mixup with 911 and the ambulance had arrived within 15 minutes, that she could have been saved? We are all playing this over and over again in our heads, and some kind of ratio or statistics would just help. I know it won't change anything, and we don't want to just be reassured.

She has been diagnosed with heart failure. While in the hospital an MRI showed she had had a heart attack at sometime in the past but the cardiologist was unable to determine how long ago. The MRI also showed she has been having TIA's, six of them to be exact. She also has a clot in her heart and a blockage that is causing her heart to only be able to pump 10% blood volume. They can't do any surgery to fix the blockage until the clot dissolves which we have been told can take several months. So, she has now been released home and family members are assisting in her care(I.e. keeping close monitoring in case of strokes, making sure she is taking her medicine, and eating properly). Her discharge instructions are fairly clear in regards to heart failure nutrition therapy. Making sure to eat a diet of a low sodium and what foods and liquids make up a low sodium diet. What the nutrition therapy instructions do not include is how many calories she should be taking in daily. After such an extreme trauma to her body I assume that her body needs the appropriate amount of caloric nutrition daily in addition to it being low in sodium to help heal itself from this damage. So, my question is; How many calories that are low in sodium should she be taking in daily? Her BMI is over 30. so she is classified as obese, but she is not hugely obese.","Diet , Heart Failure , Heart Attack"

That being said:  I have had this ""condition"" for months, now, where the following things happen.  1) Daily pains in the region just below my chest muscles and just above my stomach muscles, in the rib area. These come and go and seem to be related to stress.  They're subtle pains and only rarely stinging ones and go away when I've used painkillers such as ibuprofen or naproxen. 2) A sense of a kind of vibration on the left side of my chest, about an inch below the nipple. But it's not a vibration in itself, it's the feeling of one. I've never been able to detect anything by placing my hand over the region.  It's just this uneasy feeling of displacement.  -Does not happen when I drink alcohol. 3) A few times a day I physically feel a pull, or a contraction. Whatever you want to call it - deep inside the left side of my chest.  I can only assume this is my heart, as I can feel that it is quite deep inside my chest cavity. As if my heart is suddenly beating once at 10 times the strength. -This seems to happen more when I consume alcohol. Anxiety definitely makes all of these symptoms worse, but regardless of anxiety they are always the worst in these cases:  -I've not had enough sleep. -I've stayed awake for too long. This has occasionally resulted in an extremely fast heartbeat (probably only due to anxiety, though) of over 130 BPS, sometimes reaching 210 BPS. I really need some help, if anyone can offer advice.  I can't go to a heart doctor for this since it's a choice between alleviating/confirming my worries or paying for my daughter's and my own living. Any help is vastly appreciated. Additional info: -I'm not in good shape, but I am in no way overweight. -I smoke, though I've been able to reduce it considerably lately. -I drink alcohol around every other weekend, sometimes enjoy a beer or two after a hard day.  -I'm 23 years old.  -I have arthritis and my family has a history of MS.","Diet , Heart Failure , Heart Attack , Heart Disease"

Anyway, about a week or so ago I noticed after one of my poops that the water at the bottom of the bowl around the poop had turned an orange-ish red color after about 10 or 15 minutes. Kind of dark and hard to tell but it looked more orange than red. Also the water at the top of the bowl was more yellow (like what you would expect from urine) so the effect was more akin to a diffused orange that got lighter at the top into yellow. Since then, I have noticed this several more times, including today. The poop appears to be normal brown color from what I can tell from, you know, wiping. It doesn't appear tarry or darker than usual either. It is decidedly not the same color that I have experienced before when I eat beets, which does turn the water red! Anyway, obviously the coloration is seeping out of the poop itself, and I am just wondering if blood wrapped up in the stool would turn the water this color. If not blood, then what could it be?? Is this something I should see a doctor about or wait a while to see if it resolves on its own? Just an FYI, I am 39 year old male with no real family history of colon cancer that I am aware of, if that makes any difference. Thanks in advance for any advice you guys can offer!",

I am 56 years old, 5'5"", 248 pounds with one hip/one knee replacements which is why we can't do treadmill. I had one of these echoes for chest pain about 12 years ago; the cardiologist who ran the test said he saw no sign of blockage, heart was a good, strong pumper. It was determined I was having panic attacks and my PCP prescribed Zoloft and some years later, Xanax. I smoke 1/2 pack per day on average. Anyway, the technicians needed to get my heart rate to 139 in order to complete the test; I had stopped my atenolol 24 hours prior as they ordered. My heart rate never got above 123 (it never gets above about 106 at the gym when I have taken the atenolol). They had to abort the test when my blood pressure skyrocketed to 239/156 (normal for me on medication is about 115/65). I felt very light-headed and nauseous until they gave me repeated doses of metroprolol IV push and after about 10 minutes my BP came back down to 115/63. What caused this test to fail, why couldn't they get my heart rate up with the meds and why did my BP skyrocket to such a dangerous high? With my history, they could have killed me (stroked me out). I'm curious if this is even anything I need to worry about (had an ""abnormal"" EKG at my doctor's office about a month ago, which is what brought all this on. I have had exactly 4 EKG's in offices in my adult life and all four have read as ""abnormal"", something about an ST wave; yesterday they said I had a ""U"" wave after an ST and they thought that was weird. It might have helped if a cardiologist was actually in the room instead of a radiology tech, a student nurse and a nurse practitioner). My cholesterol has always been under 200, my HDL is 69, Triglycerides about 73 and I WALK a treadmill or do spin bike at least 3 times a week for 30 minutes. NEVER has my heart been in my throat like it was yesterday in that test, yet they said it was only going about 100 bpm, I had to squeeze a ball and wiggle my feet to ""get it going"", which it never did before they had to abort. Should I just chalk it up to ""oh well"" and hope insurance covers 100% of it?","High Blood Pressure , Heart Disease"

The cardiologist I saw told me there was nothing to worry about and that I was simply aware of my own heart beats. I was then discharged. The palpitations cleared up on their own eventually. Recently, as in within the last 2/3 months, I have noticed a return of my palpitations, but this time I am feeling a lot of skipped beats. There is no pain with these either.  I'm reluctant to return to my GP with this, as last time I felt like a bit of an idiot! I'm a nurse myself, and from colleagues of mine taking my pulse, I know I can run irregular beats at times.

I am 35 years old and in what I consider to be relatively decent health. I have been with the same woman for over two years now. This is the woman that I intend to spend the rest of my life with. She means everything to me. She is sexy, smart, and just all around amazing. We have built a great, strong relationship together. We waited about 3 months into the relationship before we became sexual. Everything was fine for quite a while. Then I think what happened was, that we had an experience that I believed was not good enough for her. I also had and incident where I was doubting weather she wanted to be with me, or if I was enough for her..  All my life I have always had a ""weird"" sex drive for a guy. Sex is great, and I love it and all but I can take it or leave it. I have never had that, have to have it every day if possible type libido that a lot of men I know have and just observing the way men act towards women out in the world. That's the background, here is what's happening. Her and I will start fooling around and I have no problem getting aroused. Then when it comes time to get naked and really get to it, it's like a turtle going to hide in his shell. I can feel my heart racing, and if I am able to get it in there, it's lackluster how long I am able to go. Obviously this is terribly frustrating for her and I.  I do not want to lose her over this, I have been honest with her about what I think is happening. Performance anxiety obviously right? She is all about getting through it together and all that. But we have had 2 or 3 bad experiences since talking about it and zero ""good"" experiences. I have noticed that if she let's me go down on her for some reason that gets and keeps me aroused. Probably because I love doing it. She is timid about that type of thing though. She likes it but doesn't have a lot of experience receiving so it's new to her. I guess what I'm asking is does anyone have any REAL suggestions. I keep reading ""just don't think about it"" or ""just relax and let it happen"" and that's great if it wasn't just generalized horoscope type advice.. how do you do those things specifically. Ugh sorry for the length here.. this is just nuts to me because I love this woman so much. Any thoughts would be very helpful. Thank yoh",Men's Issues

My husband has oral herpes with a cold sore appearing atleast once a year. However, we are always very careful to avoid oral and genital contact when these outbreaks occur. Two days ago, I noticed redness in the corner of my mouth. In previous years when cold weather set it, I have had issues with the corner of my mouth cracking. I thought it was probably that or a zit.  That same day in the bathroom, due to lack of hands, I briefly placed a clean tampon between my lips as I was finishing up. I don't remember if the end that was inserted internally touched the developing sore. But the tampon touched my lips and came into contact with my saliva. Yesterday, I woke up with a full blown cold sore and have been mentally beating myself up ever since. I was at what I believe was the prodrome stage of the cold sore when the potential contact happened. I had a few small raised red bumps and tingling. There were no blisters, pus, leaking liquids, etc. I can't believe that I may have infected myself with herpes due to something that I really gave no thought to and have done hundreds of times before. What are the chances that I have infected myself?",

Early this afternoon today I started having pain right below my rib cage, more towards my right side. It doesn’t hurt to touch, and It gradually got worse. I didn’t eat yet so at first I thought I was hungry. But I ate and it still continued and gradually became worse as time went on. It’s kind of difficult to explain the pain, it’s almost like a hollow feeling. It’s not throbbing or sharp it’s just there. It peaked around 3:30pm and was so painful I was about to go to the hospital it hurt so bad. As I was debating going to sit in a hospital for hours, it subsided. This is the third time this happened this year. The first was a year ago, when I was alone with my son he was an infant. I thought it was my period coming at first (not sure why because the pain was high up) and I tried Aleve and ibuprofen and it made it worse. I called my husband to come home and then called him back to cancel because it started to ease up.   Then the second was waitressing at my old job and it was the same way started a little bit and got worse through the day. It got to the point I couldnt really walk and I started crying. They sent me home. Then shortly after I left, it got better and I felt stupid for freaking out.  So the pain seems to contract like get worse and worse and then release a little bit when it peaks. The pain at its highest level is relatable to when I had a kidney stone. It is like an attack it happens then it’s over but it last hours. When the pain is at its worst it only last like an hour or less.  I’m Afraid it’s something stupid like really severe gas, but it’s rare enough I don’t think that’s it. I always feel like I’m afraid to be overreacting. I guess I should make an appointment with a GI. Does anyone have anything related to this?",

Brief summary of me, hoping u can help guide me in any way thru my painful journey--thx in advance!  2009 traveled to India 1 month, 2011 severe pain in stomach (screaming in fetal position, landing me in the ER for a night but largely subsiding after--no diagnosis), 2012 Mexico City for a few days, 2013-2014 ~6 trips totaling ~2 months in China. 2014 pain started bad again...diagnosed w/food intolerances after standard food panel (no dairy, wheat, eggs, shellfish). Did stool WBC calprotectin tests in 2014 that were normal (no ova, parasites, cysts, inflammation). 2017 stomach pain back strong...abdomen/pelvic ultrasounds clean, breath test results showed SIBO (predominantly hydrogen, but I think also methane). Did Xifaxin (Rifaximin) 550mg 3x/day 14 days (failed), linzess, ibgard, peppermint oil, dicyclomine, ibuprofen, probiotics (heard may be bad for SIBO?) + Siebecker's SIBO diet (not strictly). Pain levels seem highly correlated w/stressful times. Previous GI ineffective/highly unresponsive.  Now looking for (ideally) an Anthem-covered Dr. specialized in curing SIBO, no more than ~45 min drive from Oakland CA (by San Francisco). Plz share what u recommend for cure & any detail about a recommended doctor e.g. (1) Track record of success treating SIBO e.g. finding and fixing underlying causes so we dont have to be on these crazy diets forever (2) Availability. Whats typical turn-around time to get answers, appointments? (3) Do they care enough about patients, SIBO, finding a cure in least amount of time/pain/cost possible (4) Are they open to alternative treatments such as herbals (are they more effective? Some say NDs/functional MDs r better but they're not covered so that's last resort (or can maybe see simultaneously if that is what you advise) + there's only 1 published report of herbal antibiotics for SIBO treatment) + can they even perform things like colonoscopies/endoscopies?

Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/36051/chronic-unexplained-nausea,"Chronic, Unexplained Nausea","I am writing this in hopes that someone will have experienced what I have been dealing with and/or can offer some advice or insight. I am a 29 year old female. About 8 months ago, I began experiencing really random bouts of nausea. Some episodes lasting hours, some not as long. This nausea was not triggered by anything in particular, with or without food on my stomach. Before this began, I was weighing a healthy 120-125 pounds. My nausea began happening often enough, that I understandably could not eat, and when I did, it was not much, or just potatoes and soups.  When I first saw the doctor about this, they gave me Rx for Zofran for the nausea, fluids, and another Rx for omeprazole thinking that acid may be the culprit. They also tested me for h.pylori (negative). The nausea continued. After my doctors basically made me feel like this was all in my head, I gave up on them and got in with a gastroenterologist. He performed a biliary ultrasound (came back normal) and an upper endoscopy. He stated that he found mild gastritis in the duodenum that tested negative for infection and celiac disease. He said this mild gastritis was most likely not the cause of my symptoms.  I was then referred to a psychiatrist due to the thought that these symptoms could be stress related, although I did not see how. They put me on a low dose of Trazadone every night.  The symptoms continued and to an extreme level. After being bedbound for a week, I became nauseated, dehydrated, and malnourished enough that I landed myself in the E.R. While in the E.R., they performed a chest x-ray and an abdominal CT with contrast, which came back normal. They sent me on my way with more nausea medication. At this point, I was now down to 100 pounds at 29 years old.  The following week, I began seeing a nutritionist and holistic practitioner. He ran tests on my blood, urine, saliva, and a mineral test as well. From these tests, he have me a supplement regimen based on all the areas I was deficient in. He said my digestive function was low (no shock there) and the lack of nutrition put my body in ketosis and it was eating itself. He put me on a Mitochondrial Restore, a powder probiotic, Skeletal Strength capsules, 1/2 TSP of flax seed oil per day, Repair-Vite intestinal repair, Master Gland capsules, and whey protein shakes to help with nutrition.  It has been 2 months and I feel worlds better than I did before. I am eating more. I have only put a couple pounds back on, but no further weight loss. I have had a couple bouts of nausea, but for the most part have been able to ward it off. I have been obsessively concerned about my weight, though. I want so desperately to get back to a healthy weight and I just do not understand why I am not able to put it back on since I am eating, getting nutrition, and taking needed supplements. I had a random bout of nausea today and I am just very fearful that I am back sliding. Does anyone have any similar experience with chronic unexplained nausea? And furthermore, does anyone have any advice about the weight not getting put back on?",

I went over 13 months without entering into any sort of relationship with another woman. The prospects just weren't there, and the time away from dating did me a lot of good. However, I've recently met a woman (over a month ago) who may very well be 'soulmate' material. The physical and emotional attraction has been through the roof. We are both extremely sexual people as well. We've had sex 5 times now in just over a week, but there were 8 actual attempts. I've had trouble forming an erection 3 times, and even in the 5 times I was successful, the erections have been nowhere near as full and hard as they've been in the past. My levels of desire could not be any higher for this woman. The sex (that we were able to have) has been amazing. Luckily for me, she is incredibly patient and understanding. I am seeing my doctor on Thursday this week, and am wondering whether I should bring this up, and discuss ED medication? Request bloodwork? Or is it, as I suspect, all in my head? Can anybody here relate to this situation and share how you were able to overcome it? I know it is a pretty radical change for me.

No-one on the internet seems to have the same symptoms as me, and I can't find anything similar to my symptoms online. I have been having palpitations 24/7 for the past 6 months, even when I'm not aware of them they are there. Heartbeat is not fast or too slow but it pounds very hard and moves my whole body with it. It almost feels like something is clogged and blood is trying to push through an artery or an artery is weak and struggling to push blood through, so it uses extra strength when contracting. When I lay down face down or sideways I can feel as if something is being filled, exactly like a lung would when you breathe. My whole body bloats, usually my chest, stays like that for a few seconds then it slowly deflates. Sometimes it deflates in steps slowly decreasing with the pattern of my heartbeat. This probably happens throughout the day but I only physically feel it when I lay in bed. To feel the bloating better I hold my breath for 30 sec. I feel heartbeat at a regular constant pulsation, my heart beats normal yet my whole chest, and sometimes face, cheekbones and even legs are bloating. I know its not my lungs doing the bloating for I'm not breathing. It is possible its not my heart since I would probably feel an abnormal heartbeat if my ventricles where just filling with blood and not contracting properly right?? My theory is that its my veins or arteries, like aneurysms or artery damage. I've had a chest x-ray and it came back normal. ECG normal. But I have abused cocaine in the past.

I've smoked for a lot of years over ten but I'm in the process of quitting cold turkey now. So this all started when I was pregnant about 4 months and I started having heart palpitations, told my gynecologist and they send me to the cardiologist to have an echo, and ultrasound and I also wore a monitor for a day. They said they could find nothing so I let it go. The only other thing I mentioned to my doctor was that I had bad neck pain and she just told me to go get a massage. Fast forward to about a month after having my daughter. Pregnancy went good no problems so did the first month. Then I started having post partume depression I couldn't get out of bed didn't want to do anything and didn't feel good at all. Started feeling chest pressure and shortness of breath let it go for awhile and then finally went to the er one night because I was feeling really bad. They did an EKG and a few blood tests and sent me home. Then I called my doctor and set up an appointment and told her I was having bad headaches and chest pain with shortness of breath and the headaches were causing me to talk slower and forget things. They set me up with a month ecg machine to record my incidents and an app with the eye doctor. Now from then until now which has been about a month I've went to the er twice because my chest was hurting so bad and I felt like I was going to pass out. Alls they did was ekg and blood tests and sent me home. Now I'm sitting here and lately I've been feeling horrible. Every time I exert myself my heart races and my left arm hurts. The left side of my neck has still not stoppped hurting since I went to the doctors months ago. I get shortness of breath and feel like I'm gonna pass out when I exert myself my left arm hurts and so does the bottom left side of my back.

Over a year ago I started suffering from constipation. It started around Nov/ Dec 2016. In the beginning I just wouldn't go for a few days, but then I'd go for a run and that would help. However by the end of January I couldn't go without laxatives. The stool softener ones (ex. miralax) didn't do anything at all, only the ones that cause bowel contractions (dulcolax ) actually work. On the rare occasion I would go a tiny bit without laxatives, the stool was never hard, it was just as if I didn't have the urge to go.  Along with this I've gained weight, and have had a ton of trouble trying to lose it. I always seem to be hungry, and never feel satisfied with meals.  These symptoms made me suspect hypothyroidism. As I've also had irregular periods, cold intolerance, fatigue, decreased sex drive.  However I've been to four doctors, two ran blood tests, and my TSH and T4 levels were completely normal. Another doctor determined it to be IBS-C, and prescribed Constella, which literally did nothing. One doctor insisted it was my diet. However I normally eat very healthy, especially during the summer. During the school years (especially during exams) my diet probably got a lot worse. However the fluctuations in my diet did nothing to change the constipation symptoms.  Its at the point now where if I don't take laxatives, I literally just won't go. So every two/three days I take dulcolax, which is the only thing that seems to work. It's extremely unpredictable for when it will work (its taken 4-24 hours), and I get horrible cramps and its generally awful, and effecting my school and social life.

It does not hurt during penetration, and I am uncircumcised so when the foreskin is covering it there is no pain. It primarily only occurs when in contact with things other than penetrative sex (hands/cloth/pants...). I don't think I have any other symptoms of balanitis, and it doesn't really get worse or better over time. But it does sometimes become an issue during sex, and makes it difficult to clean. I am really only comfortably able to run water over it, and even heavy water pressure can be painful (I often use the foreskin as a barrier between my hands and the tip to clean). My question is whether there is anything I can do to alleviate this pain and slowly adjust to not having discomfort to the touch.",

Is it safe for me to use home remedies suggested online ? (even for the one inside my anus?) and if so which one do you think i should use ? Please note that i live in a non-gay-friendly country, so i prefer not visiting a doctor and if it's necessary would it be believable or okay for me to lie and say that i think its the result of a diarrhea or do tags inside the anus only occur as a result of anal intercourse..? or i could just visit and tell them i have noticed them just recently as they might of appeared a long time ago and the cause remains unknown.

We kept an open relationship, so we both had other partners during this 6 month period. Less than a month before his return, I noticed spotting between my periods, so I got tested & found out I had chlamydia, likely from one of my partners during that 6 months. I got treated, and was told to wait 30 days before having intercourse. My partner returned after about 20 days, he immediately got tested prior to us having intercourse again, and results came up negative, so we carried on with our relationship. I neglected to check back after 30 days to see if the chlamydia was eliminated, but I no longer noticed the spotting symptoms. Fast forward 2.5 years, I have been with that same partner the whole time & neither of us has had any other partners. We have not used condoms this whole time. I went to urgent care a couple weeks ago to get a UTI treated, and the urgent care physician decided to check my urine for chlamydia again as well. Much to my surprise, I had chlamydia again (or still), although I hadn't noticed any symptoms. My partner got immediately tested again, and AGAIN his results turned up negative. We were both given medication regardless, and now we are waiting to have intercourse again until we can figure out what is going on. 1. Is it possible that the chlamydia could have survived the first treatment and has been with me these past 2.5 years without symptoms? 2. Is it possible that he would not have contracted it over all that time having unprotected sex? 3. Is it possible I could have a false positive or that he could have a false negative?","Chlamydia , Women's Issues , Men's Issues"

For as long as I can remember it's always been between 80-95bpm while sitting . My mom thought a fast heart rate was a good thing so she didn't need to do anything about it. So I went through many years with a fast heart rate. Thank you mom. It is about 100 while standing. 75-80 when I wake up in the morning. I had it checked out but they found nothing wrong with it. It just beats fast. I even had a 24 hour heart rate monitor on me. I had a (few.) EKGs. I had an x-ray (I think it was an x-ray.). All they found was my heart was just fast. Since my resting heart rate was under 100bpm I'm not on any medications. My blood pressure is on the high end of normal. Sometimes it's normal.  I rarely get chest pains, but I sometimes do feel my heart beating especially if I walk up the stairs. I do some heavy lifting at my job, I'm a dishwasher in a manufacturing plant. I sometimes take walks, rarely jog, but that is obviously not enough. What I want to ask about refers to studies I have read where people whose resting heart rate was in the upper range of normal are significantly more likely to develop heart disease. If I am not mistaking, it is the wear and tear from the fast heart rate that gives people heart disease and heart attacks. There isn't anything ""wrong"" with my heart, but that doesn't mean it hasn't gotten anymore wear and tear from the years I've had this problem. What I would like to know is, is it too late for me?

On January 3rd, 2017 I went to a clinic to have an ECG. I felt some of my symptoms might be those of a heart attack. On occasion, I felt fatigue and tiredness. I also had a sensation in my left shoulder and left leg. I did not have pain or discomfort, it just felt like a tingle. Sometimes when I was at work (teacher) I would have trouble speaking and felt out of breath when I spoke. I would have to stop speaking and take a deep breath. Sometimes I had difficulty focusing on anything, like watching a movie or when driving. Often times I had to look away and look back, but I could not focus for long periods of time. So I decided to go to the doctor.All of these issues would come and go. After my ECG and blood test, my doctor told me my heart was fine, but my blood pressure was very high (150/100). I did not have diabetes and my kidneys were fine. He prescribed me Valianz and said I would need to take this for the rest of my life. Blood tests revealed I my cholesterol and triglycerides was high. I took Lipitor and another medication for 30 days only.  I changed my lifestyle, started going to a gym and cutting out fast food and carbs. I was going to gym for about a month and I hurt my back because I was overdoing it. I have not been in the gym for the month of February. Currently, I am only taking Valianz for medication and I maintain a low carb high protein diet. Lean meat mostly and only fast food on a few occasions. However, some of the old symptoms have returned. Like the sensation on my left side. The sensation goes away when I am not laying down.  In the past, I had sleep apnea and used a cpap machine. I stopped using it because I had lost a lot of weight but since I had been snoring a lot and not sleeping well I started using it. Now sometimes I feel like I have shortness of breath. I had some discomfort in my chest area but it is not pain or pressure. This had just started the past Wednesday night and I missed work Thursday and Friday to rest and consider going to the doctor. I also wanted to get some rest and sleep.  So, I guess my question is, should I be worried? Also, if my heart is fine or should I be considering other possibilities? Is it possible for my heart to be fine in January and not fine now?

Sex is the joining of 2 people that love each other and give yourself to each other, maybe you grew up with parents/grandparents telling you it was nasty and disgusting. I am most sad that you miss the truth and the enjoyment of what is really is. I hope I have helped, and good luck. I also want to add and probably shouldn't but if your husband is not getting his sexual needs met he will look outside the marriage ""I PROMISE"", he may turn to Porn also and that is just as bad as an actual affair. Please find someone educated that your comfortable talking with.",

Sexual Health & STDs,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/21133/my-girlfriends-ejaculate-is-not-normal,My girlfriends ejaculate is not normal,I was with my girlfriend for the first time in a few months.. She always squirts a lot when we have sex and its usually clearish sweet tasting. Yesterday when she was squirting I noticed it was yellowish in colour and smelled very pungent and tasted not well or like it usually does.. Like I said she hasnt came like that in a while so I thought it might just from being in there so long but something is just not right.. Neither of us have ever noticed it before and she was really upset and self concious about it. I love her so I told her it was fine and I even ate her out although the taste was almost unbearable.. She doesnt drink eat or drink enough so I told her to flush her self out and to start eating and drinking more.. She is on adderall and she told me the day before she had smoked some meth.. I know it's a dirty drug and was thinking it just might be from the meth but im not sure. Before she squirted I ate her out and she tasted fine like always its just her ejaculate.. Theres no reddness or itchin or any other signs of std or infection. She also told me she hasnt had her period in over a month which isnt normal cause shes not pregnant.. Could it be some type of infection or could the drugs and not hydrating enough be the cause? We dont use condoms should I be worried of having sex with her until it clears up.?. Any thoughts or comments would help.. And im gona try to get her into the gynecologist incase it doesnt clear up. - THANX,Women's Issues
Sexual Health & STDs,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/21189/curious,Curious...,"Today I noticed a small, (smaller then a pea) hard, round lump underneath the skin on the labia minora. Just one tiny bump. Doesn't hurt at all, (unless I press hard on it of course,) and I wouldn't have noticed it unless I was routinely checking myself (I'm just that way, I always make sure to look for any abnormalities.)  I recently had a full panel STD test done a few weeks ago, and all came back negative, (except for HSV1. Which I must be asymptomatic since I have never had a cold sore or mouth sore in my life.)  However, I did have a sexual encounter with a friend about a week ago. We used protection. He did preform oral on me. He didn't have any signs of sores or lesions. So what I am asking is, does this bump sound like a plugged oil gland? or is there the slim chance he passed something on to me? I already have HSV1, and I do know that HSV1 'can' cause genital sores. That is, if he even has it, to which I already have HSV1.  Thoughts?",

I am a person that generally suffers from obsessive fears about specific things and currently I am worried about anxiety or some new illness ruining an upcoming dream trip. Well last night I was out with a few colleagues of mine from university. A bit before that I started to feel sick and experienced hot flashes and extreme thirst, but thought it would eventually go away. Then I had one drink and all of a sudden my obsessive fears increased and eventually I had an anxiety attack. This resulted in me feeling like I was going to throw up and I eventually did. The next day I felt better, but I had a bit of diarreah. Though I had no fever or weakness. Could this have been caused by anxiety or gastrointeritis?","GERD and Heartburn , IBD , Irritable Bowel Syndrome , Constipation"

My doctor had me try some at home remedies and they didn't seem to help. So he had me do an abdominal xray and found nothing. so then he set up a ct scan with contrast and found nothing. Then he set me up for a colonoscopy and you guessed it.. they found nothing. Apart from a small internal non bleeding hemorrhoid. I've increased my water intake and started taking metamucil. I am going more frequently now, but its still not right. My doctor basically just says sometimes this happens to people and sent me on my way. he also has me on a daily dose of miralax. My biggest concern now is that it comes out normal width, but it is pretty flat most of the time. not roundish like it is supposed to be. Should i be concerned about that if i am going more frequently now?I am not really in any pain, i get quite about of discomfort if i dont go for a while. Are there any other things that could cause my issues other than what they could have found in the testing i had done? I asked about ibs and he basically shrugged that off. Thanks for the help, this is causing me a ton of stress and anxiety. I hope to have answers soon.","Irritable Bowel Syndrome , Constipation"
