I've tried the hot compressing over the years on and off but usually don't bother having seen minimal results. I stumbled across a treatment called ""blephex"" a few days ago. Videos of the procedure can be found on youtube but it basically uses an electric device similar to a toothbrush across the eyelids to remove the debris/ bacteria. I'm surprised not to see a thread on this already?! This afternoon i attended an appointment to undergo the procedure. It was painless (tickled a little) and took around 20mins. The eyelids are still red / swollen but feel as fresh as I can remember. Hopefully the redness reduces over time too but regardless I would definitely recommend looking into this treatment. It cost me £59 but I imagine the cost will vary depending on the clinic you book through. Hope this helps Daniel 1 like, 7 replies "

I remembered the incident very clearly, that I landed on my left palm, and there was a slight rotation of my humerus towards the left.The only discomfort back then, was the mobility of my arm and pinched nerves. It healed up after about a month or less.  In the last 15 years, I have never encountered any range of motion issues, or push/pull with/without weights. I have participated in high intensity sports with no problems other than disparity of arm strength - about 10% weaker considering i am a left hander. There are no clicking of joints. It can be noticed from the back of my arm that the elbow joint is not quite in place. From the front, it looks exactly like how the injury happened and the bicep does not fully contract when flexed. I am considering treatment around the end of the year. I need some opinions on whether such treatment is advisable after 15 years. What is the average healing time?

I was originally sent to Minors, but then an orthopaedic surgeon saw me and rushed me straight to theatre where I was in surgery for 3 hours. The consultant managed to ""piece"" all the bits of bone together using a tension band. I was in hospital for one night and placed on an antibiotic IV. I was then discharged with one week's worth of oral antibiotics.  I was told at this time that I would be able to straighten my arm but maybe not 100%.  Two weeks later, the elbow was so inflamed and hot, that I was admitted to hospital for a week and placed on IV  , and I also underwent two ""wash out"" operations, where more debris was removed from the wound.   Again, I was discharged but with NO antibiotics.  Two days later and the wound is severely inflamed yet again and I had to go back to my consultant for a 4 week course of oral antibiotics.   During this time I have been having physio but the elbow is locked and absolutely refuses to move past a 90 degree angle.  Then, last week, the wound become inflamed and sore yet again, and I was admitted to hospital where I underwent surgery to remove the tension band, as my consultant felt this was preventing the infection from healing.   I feel that if the consultant had cleaned the wound out sufficiently when I had the accident, then it would not have become infected.  Also, I am now being told that I may never be able to straighten my arm.  This means no horse riding, no driving, no yoga (which I was going to teach etc).  I cannot get myself dressed as I cannot raise my right arm, and I cannot do other self care things for myself.  My questions are (a) do I have a case for medical negligence regarding the infection and (b) is there a procedure whereby I can straighten my arm?  Many thanks and sorry this is so long winded!

Elbow Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/elbow-shoulder-injury-652304,Elbow/shoulder injury ,"Hi everyone, first post here. First off let me give you background- in November of 2017 I injured my elbow at a hockey tournament. I don't really know how as it did not hurt until the next day or so. After a month of resting for two weeks and trying to play (ortho originally said maybe bone bruise) I wound up getting in more pain and got an MRI. It wound up being sprains of the MCL and LCL along with mild bursitis. Now this time I got some PT treatment (mostly massage, cold laser, ultrasound) and I really just didn't pick up a stick for 5-6 weeks. When I came back I had zero issues adjusting and quickly got back on my playing schedule ( which is a lot of hockey weekly) . This was late January.  Fast forward to march 18. I was playing in my basement rink that I have, in what was a freak accident I sort of stepped on my stick and fell directly backwards and landed on my previously injured elbow. I didn't think much of it and played a whole game that night. I kept testing it as the days went on and it seemed uncomfortable so I stopped playing for a week. Tried again, felt OK until a few days later when my elbow had terrible aching, along with the muscles in my upper arm (shoulder, bicep) decided was best to wait again. In this time I had some PT treatments, some massage to help with the upper arm soreness and a bit of upper back tightness on that side as well. Everything felt a good amount better so I tested it again. Skated and shot around in my basement for about 15 minutes. In the days following again experienced elbow ache, very sore upper arm muscles (deltoid region mainly, also some upper back/ neck tightness on that side) this was last Sunday.  I now have an appointment with my ortho on Wednesday.  My question is: I had similar symptoms during my first time I sprained those ligaments. Could I fall on the elbow aggravate those injuries that bad? And is that normal for all the upper arm muscles to get that sore and fatigued while trying to play? Maybe like the muscles are working to hard? Or could I have possibly also injured the shoulder as well with the fall? Any experience with something like this, and comments would be cool as I go into my appointment. Thank you!  0 likes, 1 reply "

Any advice or even just opinions would be hugely appreciated! Thank you! I have had an ear infection for about three days now, and ended up booking a private doctor video-call appointment as I really wanted   (my immune system is terrible and exams are incoming). I have experienced some   an hour after the ear pain begun suddenly and with force three days ago at night.  Somewhat warm since but not a full fledged fever. Experienced jaw   for a couple weeks before (unusual for me). The doctor could not see into my ear as it was too swollen. I was prescribed this spray as well as some oral antibiotics. The instructions of the spray say it may cause hearing loss and should not be used with a burst eardrum. Just as I used the spray I've gone deaf in my left ear. I used to be able to pull my ear lobe down to hear perfectly before; not anymore.  I've tried to clean it out with an ear bud. No success I have no idea if I have a burst eardrum.

I do have serious   in the now deaf ear but I probably had that from before; the silence might just be overemphasising the tinnitus. ** What is the possibility that a small ear perforation might cause permanent hearing loss from using 'Otomize' once? and Is it really that easy to perforate an ear drum with a cotton bud while being quite cautious? Can a cotton bud cause only a small perforation without causing extreme pain? Thank you so much! 0 likes, 1 reply "

On August 11th, 2018 I had a sudden sharp drop in my hearing in my right ear. It felt like something, such as wax (which I have a long history of) got clogged in there. Over time, I started using the usual wax removal drops to no avail. Since it didn't work, I went into an immediate care facility to hopefully have that removed. Ruptured eardrum they said. I had medication given. The ruptured eardrum went away but the hearing never came back. It feels full, lot of pressure still. Every now and then I get an  , oozing feeling from the ear.

It did not help at all. I then went to my PCP (Primary Care Provider) she finally gave me a lead ""There is fluid in your ear. Take claritin"" I took what she told me, it didn't stop completely.

Ear Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/stapedectomy-experience-uk--656414,Stapedectomy Experience (UK) ,"Hi everyone, I've just had a stapedectomy in my right ear and thought I would share my experience with others who may be considering this operation. I'll try and update this every couple of days, but feel free to ask any questions you might have in the meantime. I've really benefitted from reading people's first hand accounts in the lead up to this op so this is my opportunity to try and give something back to this niche stapedectomy community ;-). Since Dec 2016 I started to notice that I was losing hearing in my right ear. At first it was only minor (20% loss) but by early 2018 I was classified as severly deaf in that ear at around 85-90% loss. The severe hearing loss had a big impact on my social life, my ability to carry out simple tasks (i.e. riding my bike) as well as my work (meetings became a struggle). All of this coincided with a 10 year relationship break up in 2017, which when combined with my hearing problems, made me the social equiavalent of Gollum from Lord of the Rings. Something had to be done... Getting the diagnosis for Otosclerosis in my right ear took a bit of time. Initially I thought it was wax build up and went to see a Dr in Romania while visiting my then girlfriends parents. They couldn't find any wax and recommended an MRI to check it wasn't anything sinister. Returning to the UK I got an appointment with the ENT department who undertook a series of checks and concluded I had Eustachian Tube Dysfunction. Cue several months of steam baths, decongestants, anti-hystamines none of which were effective in improving my hearing. I also had a CT scan which confirmed that there were no tumours present (these tumours are often harmless even if found). Returning to ENT after 6 months ready to demand grommets for my ears I was put through a hearing test again. This confirmed I was now severly deaf in my right ear, but also that my Eustachian Tubes were functioning normally. Hmmm? What had happened? It turns out that the machine that they would have used to check the pressure in my middle ear canal wasn't working during my original appointment and therefore they were unable to discount ETD. Annoying. My crude understanding of how they diagnosed my Otosclerosis is as follows. Ear drum was working fine, my auditory nerve was picking up sound fine (checked through bone conductivity tests if I remember correct) and my middle ear pressure was also good. By process of elimination they were pretty sure it was my a mechanical problem with my 3 ear bones, in particular the stapes. At the time I was given the option of hearing aids (hmm); a Bone anchored hearing aid (i.e. a hearing aid implanted into your skull) or a Stapedectomy. My personal reasons for going for the op were 1. my hearing was so bad in the affected ear that I felt the risk of losing my hearing totally through the op would not have resulted in a much worse situation to the one I was already in. 2. The success rate was for the op appeared to be good and could be undertaken as a day case 3. The op offered the potential to hear completely normally again. The other two options would have provided more artificial hearing benefits. 4. Probably an element of vanity about not wanting to wear hearing aids of have an implant  So I was quite nervous about the prospect of a general anaesthetic (GA). I woke up on the day of my surgery Tues 8th and had to skip my coffee and breakfast as per the rules. The order of play went a bit like this.... 1. Seen by nurse who checked vitals 2. Seen by anaesthesist 3. Seen by surgeon 4. Dress in funny clothes and excellent socks 5. Go into the operating theatre, have a small freak out about how many people are there just for you, get a mask over your face and then passing out. In all seriousness I am a fairly anxious person, but the NHS staff were amazing and knowing what was coming each step of the way really helped quash any mystery about the process. Essentially GA is extremely safe unless you are a 120 year old man being rushed into A&E with half an arm and a penchant for long mid-morning snoozes. The surgery took 2 hours for me, although 45-60mins is more common (i have a small ear canal apparently!). and you'll generally be put under for about 4 hours in total. Waking up you will have a nurse checking your vitals and handing you some water to sip. Everyone has a different post GA experience (inc. hysterical laughing, crying and memory loss) but for me I was just  moderately dizzy and very lethargic. I got wheeled into a recovery room for about an hour an ate everything they had on offer. The first trip to the toilet was difficult as was putting on my clothes due to being so off balance. I was given some paracetemol and Ibuprofen for the pain (at this point there was none) as well as some cotton balls to replace periodically over the next few days. I was told my follow-up appointment would be in 2 weeks where the packing in my ear would be removed. At this point many people talk about being able to hear straight away. I can't say this was my experience, but I largely think this is due to the packing which is fairly tight in your ear. However, I did notice that scratching my ear lobe lightly produced a much louder sound than prior to the surgery which helped to give me some piece of mind that something has worked. Dizzy and tired. Dizzyness comes more from leaning head forward, leaning head backwards or going up and down stairs. This is a very common side effect of the surgery so I'm not worried at this point. I have to move in a more considered way but I don't think I'm at risk of falling over from this feeling of being off balance. There is some pain in the affected ear but it's not too bad. Had a big meal, watched some TV and then feel asleep on my back. Just as dizzy as yesterday, cotton swab has a small amount of blood on it, ear pain definitely worse and can hear my heart beat/blood rushing sensation in my ear. None of this is unbearable and I still manage to talk to my sister on Facebook and listen to Adam Buxton's podcast. It's fairly embarrassing but one piece of advice I would give is get some 'stool softners' and or laxatives. A side effect of GA and pain medicine is constipation. Combine straining with a traumatised ear op and you have a fairly tricky pain balancing act while hovering over the toilet. Heed my words! Bad night of sleeping waking up in pain. Think I'm trying to do to much to soon. No change in hearing, but I'm really not expecting anything until the packing is out. Felling generally a bit deflated after the GA and not being able to do anything active...I am not an indoors person. Had a dizzy walked to the shops looking like a drunkard. slightly better sleep. Still some pain but I've only taken one ibuprofen today so it could definitely be worse. Still some minor bleeding on cotton swab. Ear continuing to make weird farting and squelching noises. I'm pretty relaxed that my ear is in recovery mode so I'm not expecting any miracles at this point. You'll read on other forums that some other people are already back to work at this point. This still feels some way off for me, but from what I've read about this procedure I can say for sure that everyone has very different recovery experience and associated timescales. Life can't be too bad as I've managed to write this post. Will update more over the coming days...   1 like, 126 replies "

I had my stapedectomy operation done in Decem...","Hi there, I had my stapedectomy operation done in December 2006 and thought I'd share my experience with anyone who might be considering this operation and sprawling patient forums as I did. I was 60% deaf in my right ear and had early signs of   in my left ear. I decided to go ahead with the opeartion largely because insurance doesn't cover hearing aids. My specialist was Mr. J A Lavy who I can't recommend enough. He explained that there was a 1% chance of total hearing loss and 10% chance that my hearing wouldn't improve and as others have mentioned they may not be able to do the operation should my facial nerve be in the way. I had the operation done under local anaesthetic and was also given a sedative. I have to say the most painful part of the whole experience was the injections in my ear but they are over in a matter of minutes. Unfortunately my ear canal was too narrow so they had to make an incision in the top of my ear but that really wasn't a big deal and has left the tiniest of scares. I watched the operation as it was being done through their camera which was quite reassuring as there were a lot of loud noises as they chipped away at bone etc. I fell asleep as they were doing the laser bit and came round after they had sewn up my ear drum. The advantage of them doing it under local was that they could do a mini test on my hearing there and then. I felt extremely dizzy after the op - don't underestimate how dizzy u'll feel. I think that it is a little under played on a lot of these sites about how rotten you'll feel for the next day or so. I ended up staying in the hospital overnight.  My recovery took a week and it was a week of very squelchy noises, having to have someone wash my hair (you musn't get it wet) and restless nights as obviously it's too painful to lye on the operated ear. Once the padding came out (2 weeks) everything was defeaningly loud and had a tinny quality about it but that settled down over the following two weeks. But I would be prepared to negotiate your social life for this period as I found that going out a bit of an overwhelming experience as I found my sense of sound direction was completely off.  Yesterday I had my hearing tested, you have to wait 6 weeks in total before it's testable, the results were fantastic I now have a normal right ear and can use the phone on that ear and hear what people are actually saying rather than just pretending to understand.  There is a small chance that I may have to have the piston replaced years from now as I am only 25 and so it may wear out also I may need to have the left ear operated on in time but I don't see this as a major issue considering how well my first op went. The things that I have been told I wont be able to do post op is scuba diving and sky diving (shucks!) Well that's it - hope that's helpful!

I fasted until 1 oclock and had a large lunch then a snack 1 hour later.. I noticed thats when the urges hit me very strong. In the past when i wasn't purging i did do intermittent fasting everyday. I have done 24 hour fasts in ther past and in this period i never binge'd and felt like my Bulimia was under control. Comparing the 2 is the 24 fasting worth it if it stops me from giving into this urge?  I have woke this morning and feel *normal* no crazy urges & cravings.. Feels free of my mind! But once i have any form of food those urges will appear. My plan today is to fast until my dinner tonight and have my calorie intake (3000 calories) over 1 meal. I will feel satiated and also i hopefully wont binge/purge. Is this worth it if your trying to recover?  Might still seem like an eating disorder but i know that purging is awful on the body so cutting that part out and still having large meals. Good idea for now or not? I am waiting on going to an eating disorder clinic (I have been referred) but itsa waiting game im just wanting to break this awful cycle. I dont want to have this everyday.

I woke up very early this morning with a weird twitch inside my ear. A thumping sound that i can feel and hear. Ive been having bodywide twitches since december especially in my right foot. Doctor doesnt know what it is. i suspected ALS could be possible cause but doctor wont refer me to a neurologist. Anyway, the ear twitch is completely new symptom. Somethings gotta be going on for me to have pain in my ear and my throat. has anybody ever had this issue??? 0 likes, 0 replies "

I am a 23 year old female, at a height of 5ft 4” and my weight is 7 stone 10 lbs (108lbs). However I have binged and gained 2lbs due to this and PMS (water weight) because previosuly I was 7 stone 8 lbs (106lbs) a few days ago. I want to desperately lose more weight and feel frightened if I try and gain any weight what-so-ever. I have gone to my GP before about this but they just said that I should try to cheer myself up by doing things that I enjoy. That was all they recommended, at that time they weighed me at 7 stone 7 lbs (105lbs). I think my BMI needs to be even lower before they can consider treating me. I’m not sure what to do but I just want to get thin again and lose the weight. I become even more scared to eat out with my family and try to seclude myself from eating in front of them.

I have only 2 meals a day, and I think I don't eat enough. My breakfast meal consists of a half a cup of a smoothie, a serving of fruit, and 3 walnut halves.  My lunch is a big meal, or so I think. I have a bowl of fattoush salad, a cup of Greek yogurt, and a small serving of whatever my mother cooks for lunch. Something weird I like to eat also is the white parts of a watermelon. I don't know if it's healthy, but I also have about 4 decent slices of watermelon rind and I munch on the white parts.  What I'm really concerned about is how I try to eat a bit of a lot of food in the kitchen. For instance, I eat a spoon ful of rice FROM the pot, then I eat a spoonful of some leftover dinner and so on. I do that while I am preparing my lunch. I think it's a self control issue.  On the side, I have been slowly and gradually gaining weight over the last month. I am not overweight. I also workout for at least 30 minutes 6 times a week. I'm 173 cm tall and 56 kg.

This lasted a long long time, I went to a psychologist for 3 months which was no help and then a psychiatrist for about 8 months now. With time, after about a year and a lot of diazepam and anxiety medication I eventually overcame the disorder almost completely. The last few months were the happiest I have ever been. But the happiness was short lived. Two days ago I woke up, threw up and felt the worst   I had ever experienced, every time I take a bite of food I have to lay down and meditate to keep it in. It takes me hours to eat a small meal. I am still on the same medication and am very worried about this. Why did it come back? What do I do? I'm dehydrated and hungry but can't eat or drink.

I was fairly overweight in my early 20's and i met a partner. I felt like i needed to change and get myself *healthier* so i dieted for around 5 month straight and had zero issues. I dropped 4 stone in weight overall and at the start looked *worse* but after stop dieting my body started to fill out slightly ' My face looks less Guant etc and i was very happy. In this period i had zero Bulimia urges. I then carried on around about the weight i had dropped to and felt very happy. My eating pattern was good and i was healthy.  I dont remember exactly how my Bulimia started but im sure it was due to fear of going back to that old me that was overweight. So i started to purge to keep my weight down. I then got into fitness after i had to get a knee cartlidge surgery. I had a torn knee cartlidge and the nurse says to me if you keep your legs strong and in shape then you wont ever suffer any problems later in life.... So i joined a local gym.  I was managing to keep a good diet and completely transformed my physique. Over the years i have had Bulimia on and off. I have went months without binging and purging and then i relapse and im back to the start. I recently started to binge and purge again and this time its VERY strong and im struggling to grasp it again. I went to my GP around 5 weeks ago and was just honest and i explained everything to her. She has tried me on medication (Doesn't work sadly) so she says i will refer you to an eating disorder clinic. I need to add in. My partner has zero clue about my eating disorder. I hide it very well. My GP referred me and the eating disorder clinic sent me a very specific letter to my home and i *just* managed to hide this and i panicked and cut cords with the clinic and my initial appointment as i want to do it in the background at the moment until i start to feel like i am getting a grip of things again. Im not ready to tell my partner. I am very embaressed about what i do. I know thats the worst thing to think but i genuinely am very embaressed and if my partner was to find out i reckon i would run away   Just opening up to a GP was very hard but i want help. I dont want to live with this Illness for the rest of my life. I have been binging purging for the last 3 months with a few days break randomly inbetween this period. These breaks are where i write up a meal plan and *try* stick to it but after a few days my urges come back STRONGER than ever and i relapse. I feel like i am spinning my wheels and cant get myself stable. Im 5 foot 9 and 31 year old. I try and hit around 3200 calories. I fear gaining the weight but i know i need to eat over and above what i burn and let my body know thiers not a famine happening. But Yesterday i woke up and had a very nice breakfast and i eat a big breakfast also to try and remove my binge urge. I feel absolutely no bulimia urges at all but fast forward to around 6 oclock. Even after breakfast & snacks a large lunch etc the Bulimia hits me hard and i came home and binge'd on a ton of food and purged. I was so angry and guilty with myself. I still had the urge to binge on LOADS more but after dinner which i had packed out with veggies ' Meats ' Carbs etc just to keep nutrition in my body and plenty potassium etc  i fought to keep this dinner down as i knew i needed this nutrition in my body and i held on after eating that dinner.  I want to eat normal again and not have this demon in my mind. I want to be healthy and normal but this has a grip of me very strongly this time. With me doing fitness i know nutrition is key to growth and progress but i cant seem to get a hold of it this time. The hunger signals my brain is sending is beyond strong.  I can easily binge on 8000 calories just to feel satisfied to which i get that guilt and i end up purging.   Any advice?  Im showing some very serious health issues. Chest Pains' Numb hands and feet every night that wakes me up ' Mouth throat all raw from the stomach acid's ' Constantly cold hands and feet ' Anxiety etc I have recontacted my GP and have an appointment rescheduled (Its 2 weeks away though). Now that i have opened up to them im not embaressed to go and speak to them again and start the ball rolling once more. I need the help and if i dont do it now i could really give myself health problems which i dont want. Any advice on what i could do? I have tried structured eating and incorporating high fats in the diet. I also add in foods that i would stray away from usually to try and stop the major urges for these foods. I feel like i cant get a hold this time. Everyday i wake up i keep saying ok today i will focus on just keeping everything down. What happens is when i eat breakfast or lunch etc my body becomes frantic for more food. I have even done 24 hour fasts before just so i can do a massive one meal at night just so i cover all the nutrients i need and also to feel satisfied with the amount of food i am getting at that sitting.

I had it re-positioned on the day (August Bank Hoilday Monday).

At ths point (and a lot of crying on my part) they suggested the replacement of the radial end joint, which I had no real choice but to agree. I had the operation just over two weeks ago which I was told went well, but I am very worried and frightened about the outcome as I still have limited arm motion up to bicep (I can exercise to just over half way) and still tentative with the radial motion on my wrist I still have swelling post op. on the elbow itself so I appreciate that this takes time, they also hadto fix ligament damage which they did without needing to perform extra work on my wrist.

Elbow Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/radial-head-replacement-and-lateral-colateral-ligament-reconstruction-607217,Radial Head Replacement and Lateral/Colateral Ligament reconstruction,"I Shattered my elbow 3 times and had a Radial head replacement, Lateral/Colateral ligament reconstruction and several plates and screws. I am having issues with severe swelling in my wrist, lack of strength and severe pain in my hand, as well as losing movement and severe pain in my elbow. I am 8 months on in this injury and feel very isolated.  Story: Four months ago I had a Radial head replacement with a collateral and lateral ligament reconstruction. This was the first time my surgeon had ever done these two procedures together, and I was the first case of my kind at Occupational Therapy. My origional injury happened at the beginning of Januarary when I fell on the ice and fractured my elbow in about 7 different spots. I did not need surgery for that injury as everything miraculously broke in alligement. My ulna was broken clean through with three different breaks, but still, all in line. After a rough PT (my first pt rebroke my ulna whilst calling me a big baby for not being able to do the exercise she wanted, because she had BROKEN my ulna again) I stepped on a cat toy and fell down a flight of stairs in my house. I was trying so hard to protect my elbow that inevitably I landed on it and rebroke it terribly. It was bad, I had surgery to put 7 plates and lots of screws in to hold everything together. One week after surgery while I was sitting on the couch I felt something in my arm dislocate followed by immense pain. I thought, no that did not just happen, and in the spirit of that denial I waited until my follow up four days later to tell my surgeon. All he had to do was look at my arm to see something was wrong. The x-ray showed my raidius had dislocated and smashed into all the already broken bones in my elbow and just decimated itself. So, after second opinions, one week later I had a Radial head replacement with a lateral and collateral ligament reconstruction.  I am four months post surgery and having some serious complications. I killed my occupational therapy, gaining almost a normal range of motion, I was a little less than 10 degrees off on flexion and extension, my supination was less than 5 degrees off and everything else was normal. During this time the main problems I had were nerve pain and normal regaining muscle and injury pains. My surgeon stopped my Occupational therapy 6 weeks in because it was starting to get a bit more painful and he said that I was way overdoing it. All my lovely progress ended about 4 weeks ago. I woke up one morning with my elbow and my arm all the way to my fingers swollen and unable to move. This lasted about 4 days during which my surgeon was out of town and none of his partners would see me. Since then, I have lost quite a bit of progress on my flexion, extension and supination. The pain can get quite excrutiating. I find it frustrating, isolating and debilitating. I lost my job to this injury 4 months ago as I was unable to work full time during the injury and recovery process.  My insurance coverage, I'm in the states sad, ends in 2 months and has cost me a fortune to maintain. Now my surgeon is saying all the metal and the radial head need to come out of my arm. He said we need to wait 6 months between surgeries so I have 2 months to go in this pain. I am taking college classes right now and at the end of a 2 hour class I am almost in tears from the aching in my elbow, and by the end of the day my wrist is severely swollen and I am unable to use my arm.  I'm lonely, I sometimes feel like I'm the only one in the world having these troubles. I feel like my life is in limbo with an uncertain outcome.  0 likes, 18 replies "

I have honestly had paper cuts that hurt worse than my surgery did. I hadn't even needed to take a pain pill once.

I using that word loosely because sometimes my elbow will hurt if I keep it in a position for five minutes, sometimes it won’t; but then I can keep it bent or straight for an hour and it not bother me, sometimes I can’t. It’s very weird. But now it’s morphed into a constant pain. It’s not so bad that it makes me tear up or anything, but it has hampered what I was doing, or I completely avoided something altogether.  A little note: I haven’t done anything to exert my arm, I haven’t lifted anything heavier than my cat (about ten pounds, but I use both arms for that).  Nothing is swollen from what I can tell, nothing is bleeding, leaking, I don’t have a  , the area isn’t red or hot.  I kinda want to describe this pain as muscle deep, like when you pull a muscle and it’s sharp and you can feel it into your bones.

Elbow Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/another-tennis-elbow-thread--688560,Another Tennis Elbow Thread . . .,"Hi, all! I recently injured my right elbow - not participating in sports, but apparently by doing some heavy duty sanding on my kitchen walls!   This was about a month ago and I've been having elbow/forearm pain ever since. I haven't been to my doctor yet, but I may have to. I have sharp pain on the end of my elbow bone (right at the lateral epicondyle)   a duller pain in my upper forearm when I try to fully extend my arm. Rotating my forearm away from my body also causes the dull upper forearm muscle pain. I work in a biomedical research lab and do a LOT of pipetting of chemicals, cells in culture, and various reagents - this involves a lot of hand dexterity and thumb pressing (kind of like pressing the top of a mace cannister or a handheld gameshow buzzer). I also do a good amount of typing and mousing when analyzing data. All of this seems to exacerbate the issue and I can't just rest the elbow or I literally would get NO work done and would have to take a month off of work and just sit on my couch and watch tv. I have been wearing this elbow brace for about a week and half and it doesn't really seem to help at all: (EDIT ok the forum won't let me post a link but it's the Amazon Choice/Best Seller 'Tomight Elbow Brace with Compression Pad' on Amazon.) I was reading that if one of these arm braces does NOT help then you   have   OR your injury is severe. Well every description of tennis elbow I've read sounds just like what I have and the pain isn't absolutely terrible or anything, so I can't imagine I've terribly disabled myself. I've also read that the elbow brace should be at least 3"" wide, but mine isn't even 2"" wide! Could that be why it's not helping? When I put it on, I wiggle my fingers and look at my upper forearm to find where the tendons are moving and I place the pad part of the brace right over those moving tendons. I've tried putting the thing at various distances from my elbow, but no spot really reduces the pain. I've got   wrist rests for my mouse - one back under my elbow and one under the wrist and that seems to help a bit. Don't have one in front of the keyboard though. So what should I do? Am I using the brace right? Should I try a wider one? Do I even   tennis elbow? What else could it be? Should I just bite the bullet and go see my doc who will probably refer me to an orthopedist? SO over this already . . . thanks, guys! Cynthia . 0 likes, 0 replies "

Sometimes there is no pain at all but sometimes the pain is quite sharp. I'm guessing that's because it might be pushing down on some nerves in my arm. Every doctor that I've gone to tells me it's not a big deal and I shouldn't worry about it. Lately it's been bothering me more often than not. Sometimes when I wake up and extend my arm it is quite painful. But sometimes it is not painful at all. The swelling seems to come and go. Sometimes it is tender, painless and does not hurt when I push down on it a bit. But other times it swells up, becomes a bit hard and hurts when I push on it. Sometimes when my arm is bent for an extended period of time it hurts to extend it and the lump is swollen. I've included a picture. I plan on going to see a doctor in a couple weeks to get it looked at thoroughly but I cannot do so until May 1st. I just wanted to see if I can get anyone's opinion on this that has experienced anything like this or seen anything similar. Thanks in advance! 0 likes, 5 replies "
Elbow Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/ulnar-nerve-compression-689399,Ulnar Nerve Compression,"Hello - I appear to be experiencing some Ulnar Nerve compression in my left arm.  Here is some background on what led up to this. I am a 33 year old Male, about a week and a half ago I was working on cutting deer meat when I cut up near the left tip of my middle finger (of the left hand) with a knife.  I cleaned up the cut, applied isopropyl alcohol and Neosporin to the cut and put a bandaid on it. At the time I had no numbness or odd sensations in my hand. About 3-4 days after I took the bandage off and was noticing that I appeared to have some numbness in my hand, along with some pressure around the palm of my hand. I then started experiencing some warmthness in this hand, extending partially up my arm. When this started occuring I went to a Walk In clinic who looked at the cut and my hand and other than the cut didnt see anything abnormal. They prescribed me a 10 day supply of Amoxicillin for an antibiotic (in case there eas an infection from the cut) along with a 5 day supply of Prednisone, along with a Tetnis shot. I am not on my last day of the Prednisone course and I feel like I have much better sensation in my left hand and that my numbess is  gone, however I've had compression in my Ulnar nerve for the past few days. The compression appears to be centered mostly near my elbow, either on the inner side of the Funny bone, or just above it in my upper arm. It feels like in that one spot like the never is being pinched. I have no idea if the cut to my finger in any way could have caused this, or if it's pure coincidence. I will say that I have never experienced anything similar to this before.  From what I understand the Ulnar nerve covers your pinky finger and right side of the ring finger, whereas my cut was to my middle finger so I dont know how the cut to the middle finger would affect the Ulnar nerve. Is it possible that I have some inflammation from the cut that is somehow affecting this nerve? Would you expect to see this compression if you did have an infection I'm trying not to worry too much but at the same time I don't want to ignore the problem. Would a hand Surgeon be a good option to make an appointment with if this doesn't resolve over the next fee days or what would you recommend doing? Thank you very much for your feedback!

I have had 4 surgeries, two to get my radial head just right and 2 cleanouts...removal of bone spurs, ossifications, etc. Its been one year since my last surgery and now yet again my arthritic change in my elbow has progressed quite rapidly. On top of this my ulnar nerve is entrapped and is starting to cause neurapathy. Ive tried cortisone injections, clean-outs, and OT yet no results. So now because of the severity of my injury, progression of the arthritic tissue and ""bone"" im in pain daily and yet life seems to go on...i go to work but each day gets worse. i have an excellent elbow specialist who has done 1 of 4 of my surgeries. Honestly the only option for me is total elbow replacement w/ulnar nerve  whatever it is caused. Even though im younger than the normal age for this procedure it seems to be the only option. any advice, comments, and well wishes are appreciated.

I was expecting to start physio a long time ago but only started at the end of March which is 3 months after my operation.

My physio recently gave me the all clear to go back to the gym to do more stretches and lightweight exercises. Will my arm continue to get straighter or has it been too long of a time and now my arm is stuck between 90 degrees and fully extended??

Before you say anything, I know this is disgusting. I know I have an eating disorder. I know I should seek treatment for it, and I plan to after this last 1.5 weeks. 10 days ago, I was just coming off of a 48hr fast. I have mild anorexia subtype b/p, and I had just gone through a bad cycle of b/ps, so I was trying to ""fix it"" by eating nothing. I weighed in at 99.8lbs that morning (I am 5'3, 21 years old). Then, I received a message that my fiancé was calling off our engagement, and that we had to break up. This came as a shock (and no, it was not because of the eating disorder), and I fell into the worst binge of my life. Over 10 days, I barely left my bed. I ate bulk bag-fulls, probably 3000-4000 calories worth of various chocolate-covered nuts, yogurt-covered raisins, and other chocolates. I know this is disgusting and I obviously dealt with the situation as poorly as a person can, really. Over that 10 days, I gained 18lbs. (13lbs after some of the water weight and bloating wore off..) Now if that weren't bad enough, making me feel like a complete stranger in my own body, and being completely repulsed by my behaviour, I'm terrified that this horrible week and a half will have serious long-lasting consequences. Both type 1 and 2 diabetes run in my family, and I am scared out of my mind that I could maybe have developed type 2 or pre type 2 during this horrible time. I had my blood sugar tested about a month and a half ago and it was normal, but could I have given myself diabetes or any other serious long-term health problems because of this? I am having serious issues with craving to eat more sugar and chocolate still, but I am trying as hard as I can to not give into them. It's not always working, but I have cut back on it by at least 90%. I am really scared here. I will go to the doctor, but until then I just need some guidance or opinions on this. I mean I obviously don't feel well at this point, I feel sick and vaguely nauseous, I am tired and have no energy, but I also did just spend 10 days mostly in bed or sitting still for hours on end. I haven't been peeing more, really, just when I drink a lot of fluids which I imagine is normal, especially considering how much water I must have been retaining. I am more thirsty now that I've started to come out of it, but I wasn't thirsty almost at all over the actual span of the binge... God I'm just really really scared. I thought I was just reacting poorly and that I was entitled to deal with it however helped but this is serious sh* t. 13lbs in 10 days????? BAGS upon BAGS of BULK BIN chocolate??? ANd my family history of diabetes??? I just wish I could go back and stop myself. Please, don't put me down any further than I already am by telling me how disgusting this is. I know , I know I need professional help etc etc I want it and I plan on getting it. I just need advice on the physical health side of this. Thank you in advance. 0 likes, 0 replies "

I have visited tons of dermatologists especially for my scalp problems and everyone of them just prescribed me shampoos and lotions that did literally NOTHING. Then I found a doctor called trichologist. He promised that my problems will go away in 3 months. A year of treatment the only thing that went away was my crazy spent money.

I took inositol and biotin for like half an year too but just stopped taking them because they were just useless. Vitamin D ughh... I stop and start taking it but I know my levels are alright because of blood tests. I have added Omega 3 in my supplements collection recently. I went to my Doctor for the fatigue, the anxiety, the headaches etc and she prescribed me an immune stimulating pill. Well you guessed right... another useless medication.

I resumed eating my morning whole grain with seeds toast and pizza (my weakness), and my rash returned! I was back to bleeding from the itching it was so bad. I had previously been tested for Celiac which came back negative. In fact I have zero allergies to anything, so I was skeptical in cutting gluten out, but the tie to eating pizza and immediate return to the rash was too hard to ignore.

My hands started itching right after they started peeling. And I’m not talking about the epidermis, the skin was so thin my fingers were raw. (I will add pictures) at first I thought it was an allergic reaction but I tried switching everything I thought might be leading up to this and nothing helped. Finally I went to the hospital. They gave me   and it’s started to heal. As soon as I stopped the dose it came back ten times worse. It got to the point to where I couldn’t even wash my hair I couldn’t touch anything, my fingers were literally raw. Finally I got a referral to a dermatologist. I went and he diagnosed me with dyshidrotic eczema. I’ve read everything I could possibly find on this condition and everything I read said that (it normally last 3-4 weeks, blisters and itching first then the dry skin then the peeling and that’s all) mine is never ending...blisters and itching, then the dry skin and peeling, and right when it’s starting to heal, it starts all over again. It’s been agony. Long story short in the last three months I’ve been to 7 doctors, the hospital 4 times, and med express 6 times. All with the same result. They all told me they know what it is BUT they don’t know what causes it and there is no cure. The first 6 doctors I went to gave  me steroids. It got to the point that they were making me sick (3 months straight of prednisone 50 mgs) finally I told them I couldn’t take it anymore so they gave me methyltrexate. It did nothing. While I Was on all these meds I used every cream and ointment you can name....every steroid, every antibiotic. I’ve read the leading cause is stress? If that’s the case it will be a never ending battle, just the pain of my fingers and then feeling it come on again causes stress, not to mention I’m in school and I work as a single mother...has anyone found any relief at all???

Dermatitis And Eczema,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-eczema-recovery-693781,My eczema recovery,"Hi, I wanted to come and tell people about my experience getting through eczema. Basically it was down to mold (the most serious issue), milk, sodium lauryth sulphate and dust. Since avoiding these 3 I've been able to give up all my medications and have clear healthy skin. I've always had eczema, as well as allergic rhinitis and more recently exercise induced  . A long time ago I stopped using toothpaste with SLS in because it was causing inflammation. It was never a serious issue until about 3 years ago (2015). I went and stayed at a friend's house when I moved to a new city. The only thing to use as a blanket was an old curtain from a cupboard. That night my legs started   every night and didn't stop until treatment much later. Although annoying it didn't affect my life too much, so I mostly ignored it and the skin flakes that resulted. Around 18 months ago (2017) however my skin became much much worse. I developed bright red patches of incredibly itchy, flaky skin. My skin dried out so much that it hurt to move some days. As much moisturiser as I used it just got worse and spread to more and more of my body and eventually my face. When I woke up in the morning my pillow was covered in flakes like a dusting of snow. My body was covered in cuts where the skin had broken from scratching. At this time I was using strong steroid creams like Dermovate. I put myself on a very strict diet - no eggs, dairy, meat, gluten. It didn't change. I went back to my family home for Christmas 2017 and there was a bit of a reprieve and my skin started to get better. Of all the possible triggers I had no idea which one might have changed though, so the problems continued. Finally in the summer of 2018 I got to see a proper consultant dermatologist. By this time the eczema was very severe and I had developed   (when the damaged skin becomes infected with a coldsore) and had to take 3 weeks off work to recover, plus other days when I just couldn't bear to come in. I was prescribed more strong topical steroids (still dermovate and eumovate for the face) to be used every day plus an oral steroid (prednisolone or prednisone I can't remember which). Finally the eczema started to clear up and it got better and better each day. However there was still no mention of environmental triggers or diet. When I asked I was told they weren't really important and the medication was the best thing. However during this period I found a patch of black mold on my windowsill in my bedroom. I lived in an old house and in the colder months a lot of condensation developed. It wasn't huge, just little blobs on the corners, but apparently enough to cause me a lot of harm. Once I had cleared this up my eczema stopped getting worse even once I'd finished the course of  . My skin cleared and after a month or two I was back to normal, healthy skin. I've now moved into a modern house with much better insulation and double glazing. A few weeks ago though, a small patch of mold grew and my face went bright red and started flaking. My girlfriend removed it and over the next week it completely cleared up. So I'm pretty confident now that that was the main trigger. I think that the oral steroids probably made the recovery a lot quicker, since by that point the eczema had really set in, so I can't recommend that people avoid them completely. They have their uses, but they have the potential to cause a lot of harm if misused from what I've read, so be careful and do your research. Not drinking milk has also meant I no longer suffer from allergic rhinitis (90% of the time anyway) and I don't use nasal steroid spray anymore as well as not needing an inhaler when exercising in winter as I also had problems with exercise induced athsma. I hope this provides some encouragement to keep trying things to see if they can find their triggers. I tried absolutely everything, including buying all new sheets and changing washing powder.

I did speak about this and the following weeks got better. It ended and I was like ""oh s    now what?"" But I kept going and kept doing some of the work we did together and was good and would say they were the best 8 weeks of last year to do with my mental state. Then out of no where I felt down all of sudden just from making a cup of tea. I tried to do the work but I could not cope and I did not know what to do and went to see my gp and tried to contact the therapist again and was told to sign back up. 4months later I am back doing CBT. THIS time it is with a different therapist but I prefer my other one ( I can not see her atm) it is also focusing on a certain point. which may help but I feel like it wont help and I feel that there is more ""baggage"" that this therapist is just ignoring. I know she has looked over my notes from before but how does she know what the problem is, without talking to me?

Last year I was really struggling and decided to sign up for some therapy, I got 17 sessions of CBT from a therapist which I think helped me understand more about the depression, and how to try and deal with it. I do think that helped. But I kept thinking more of my troubles come from the past and that is what is making me feel depressed and we did touch upon this and we worked together and put a plan into place to try and put things in throughout the year to look forward to, which I have done. However, around December, I had just a sudden wave of low mood, I was just picking up my cup of tea and it was like a switch had gone of in my head. I had finished with CBT for about 8-10 weeks at that point and was doing well, I was feeling more positive about things and then when that low mood came in I panicked. I tried to do the CBT stuff but it was not working, and I did not know what to do. I ended up at the gps and asked about CBT again. I reached out to the therapist I saw and I was put back on the list. I was unable to see the same therapist this time, so it is someone different, I have seen her twice now, but doing some of the homework set has brought up memories that could possibly be effecting me somehow but I do not know why or how. Also, I am not sure about this new therapist, she comes across as more stern and more serious. for example, I am going out of the house, but it does take a lot of work to leave and I do get anxious about leaving the house. I am ok when I am out, and sometimes my mind drift and I do want to go home, but I focus on something around me, which my first therapist told me to do. I have also set different things to do each month that I do not do everyday, which me and my first therapist talked about . but this new one wants me to do something totally different. I am like, what? and when? I can not drive, so I have to rely on buses and some stop at certain times. I am not really interested in a lot of things and things I am interested in are too far to travel. Should I ask her about what other options are other than CBT ? Does anyone know what other options there are? could it be that this therapist is not right for me? But could be great for someone else? 1 like, 3 replies "

Depression,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/not-sure-what-to-do-am-i-depressed--697913,Not sure what to do?  Am I depressed?,"i just want to say im only posting this here as i feel like i cant talk to anyone in my life about it and dont really want to go to my GP. im 90% sure i am suffering with depression but dont want to see my Gp as i dont like sharing my feelings and feel as though if i did get diagnosed with it then im weaker than what i thought i was. also im currently 7 months pregnant and i feel as though im a bad person for feeling so low during this exciting time in mine and my fiance's life. ill list the reasons why i think im suffering with depression, this is the first time im ever writing this all down in the same place so sorry for the big paragraph! 1- my parents split when we were on holiday when i was 11, my dad was drunk and i dropped a plate and my dad shouted at me which caused my mum to defend me.. the argument got heated and my dad hit my mum. We flew home and their relationship was over, i know its not my fault but i often catch myself thinking to myself "" what if i never dropped that plate?"" 2 - my mum has been diagnosed with huntingtons disease 5 years ago, its a disease that affects the brain cell's which causes involuntary jerking and twitches, ocd, forgetfulness, depression, a struggle to eat food as she may choke and many other symptoms. It's the worst thing to witness watching her lose herself and become less independant as time passes. The disease is also hereditary and each child she has, has a 50% chance of inheriting it. I have 2 sisters and a brother also, i feel like i cant speak to them about how i feel in case it just puts more onto their plates when they are worried about their own futures and my mums. 3- Even though i love my mum to bits, i hate myself at times for finding myself getting annoyed when im with her, with the disease she repeats herself a lot, interrupts conversation a lot to say something random, obsesses over cleaning the ceilings because shes been told she cant stand on furniture to do it in case she falls, she has no concept now of personal space so if im in the kitchen making her food she will stand right behind me and follow me everywhere including the toilet, she laughs at things she shouldn't as she cant understand and comprehend what is actually being said. like i said i hate myself for getting frustrated and not being as patient as i know i should be when its not her fault she does these things. 4- my fiance, i love him so much and im so excited to be getting married and having a little baby boy with him, but i often feel like i cant talk to him about my mum when i know i should be able to, he says hes there for me and wants me to open up but we are both 24 and sadly he lost his father to cancer in 2016, he went through such a bad time with depression and hes often thanked me for being his rock but to this day i still feel like i have to be the strong one for both of us as he still has bad days now. Ive tried once or twice to talk to him about my mum but each time i have, he brings up his experience with his dads illness and how he got through it, i know hes only trying to help but i almost feel like its a burden to mention my mum as it brings up bad memories for him and also a slight bit of guilt as im bringing up my mum who i can still call and spend time with whereas he cant with his dad. 5- I feel like i have no real friends, i have work friends and friends from previous jobs but not anyone i can truly open up to. i often think, is there something wrong with me? why dont i have really close friends that other people have. 6- My sex drive is really low, it always has been since i lost my virginity. 7- I feel as though i have no ambition, no drive in me to get up and go. I have no idea what i want to do for work ( currently have a job but dont like it ) which terrifies me as im about to have a baby and i question myself on how i could be ready to become a mum when i dont even know what to do with my own life. 8 - my sleeping is terrible, i struggle to get to sleep and when i do it can be for 12 hours + If anyone has read this and thinks i could be depressed, for one thank you for taking the time to read this and two, i don't like the idea of being on anti depressants. The thought of a tablet literally changing your mind terrifies me. Any advice would be appreciated. 0 likes, 11 replies "

Depression,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/sick-of-arguing-with-my-dad-just-feel-stuck-698199,"Sick of arguing with my dad, just feel stuck","I argue with my dad a lot. We disagree on pretty much everything. Just now we were talking about me overeating, which I'm trying to stop and he kept saying things like ""When you're 20 stone you'll blame me for not telling you to stop.""  He also likes to bring up how he sees similarities between me and my mum - who was an alcoholic, ended up with   and was homeless, and still has very bad mental issues. It makes me really mad that he says I am going to end up like her. I understand that I am addicted to junk food and trust me I KNOW the effects it has and what it can lead to. Trouble is most of the time I just don't care enough to stop eating and actually look after my health because I don't know why I should i.e. I don't know what there is to be happy about to motivate me to stop - but that's a different story.  Anyway, yes I know the symptoms of junk food addiction are similar to alcohol addiction, like any addiction has similar or the same symptoms to others, and I think that is what my dad is trying to say. However it makes me feel worse that he says I'll end up like my mum - I don't remember a day when I was a child that she   drunk and causing chaos and I struggle to get through a lot of life's aspects because of her absence and the impact she had and still has on me. Why would being told I'll end up like her motivate me?  He also always likes to say that he went through 'hell' with my mum, and he doesn't want to go through it again. I witnessed this 'hell', I saw what went on and because of this I would constantly worry about my dad, and prayed that he would be happy, asking him everyday if he was ok. I cared and still care so much. When it comes to us fighting he just disregards this which pees me off.  I don't know if he's trying to manipulate me in a way. It's obvious that he is trying to make me feel bad. I don't know if I'm overreacting - my dad says he is trying to support me by saying this, and gets angry when   tell him it makes   angry that he would say that.  It's like he forgets what I went through with my mum and that he is the only one affected (as mentioned above). I understand him in a way, which is why I try not to get too angry, but I just don't think he supports me in the right way at all. If he considers that 'support' then I just don't think I can talk to him about my problems anymore. He knows I have   and am going to therapy, so I just don't know why he thinks this will make me feel better at all. I actually don't know if he struggles with accepting if he is wrong, or just thinks he is right all the time. If this is the case I don't think I'll be able to change it and will just have to accept that I can't talk to him. Thanks for reading, sorry for the long rant. I'm just lying in bed now crying and I don't know what to do or where to go from here. I made plans for tomorrow but when we fight they go down the drain as I get the same thoughts about there being no point in doing anything if we fight all the time. 0 likes, 25 replies "

Depression,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/is-it-depression-anxiety-or-did-i-fall-out-of-love-please-help--698027,Is it depression/anxiety or did I fall out of love? Please help!,"Hi everyone, For the past 3 months I have been struggling with anxiety in regards to my relationship, which was triggered by an event on New Year’s Eve. Right now, I am done with college and living at home to save up money while my boyfriend is in medical school 2.5 hours away. Our relationship has been great and very passionate, we’re almost going on two years of dating. We both have discussed marriage and children and want all of the same things for our future, and I was planning on moving to his city so that we could be closer. After NYE though, everything changed and my life has been in shambles. On NYE, I went to visit my boyfriend so that we could be together for the ball drop. Originally, we were going to do something by ourselves, but we ended up going out to some bars with his roommate who he has been friends with since high school. We feel kind of bad for his roommate because all he does is smoke weed all day and he hasn’t had a girlfriend in years; he’s more of the loner type (no offense) so we thought it’d be nice to invite him out with us. That night, I got very drunk, which I was okay with because my boyfriend was there to protect me and I didn’t think anything bad would happen. Before midnight, we went to a bar and sat at a table together, and when midnight hit, I walked over to my boyfriend and kissed him of course. I remember feeling bad for his friend though because he was all alone on New Years with no one to kiss (I feel bad easily). The rest of the night was a blur but at one point, I remember my boyfriend’s roommate asking or mentioning how he didn’t get a New Years kiss so in my drunken state I leaned in and kissed his ear (I was probably aiming for his cheek but I was very drunk). As I sobered up a bit, I started to become really ashamed and I started crying and told my boyfriend I kissed his friend’s ear. I felt so ashamed and dirty, especially because my boyfriend was cheated on in the past and I didn’t want him thinking I was like that. I know I would only do something like that innocently but it was out of character for me so it deeply disturbed me. The months following that event were rough. I constantly replayed the event in my head over and over and obsessed over it and wondered why I would do something like that and I built up so much self hate. I started getting anxiety chest pains everyday, I lost sleep for almost 2 months (I couldn’t fall asleep or my brain would wake me up at 2 am every night and I couldn’t sleep for the rest of the night), and I started to feel disconnected from my surroundings and my boyfriend. I also lost about 10 pounds in two months unintentionally because of the anxiety. It got to the point where I didn’t want to get out of bed anymore for work, and I am still struggling with that. Ever since this anxiety from that event, I feel like I’ve lost love for my boyfriend and it’s so scary. I made myself feel so gross and unlovable over something little, and I’m afraid I pushed my feelings away for my boyfriend due to feeling unworthy. My boyfriend didn’t care at all about the event but I obsessed and obsessed for months, and now I’m scared I destroyed the relationship on my end. It scares me that seeing my boyfriend doesn’t excite me anymore and that I feel so disconnected from him. I feel no passion and no spark. I want to feel all those things so badly and I know they’re there deep down and want them to come back! But then I think, what if I fell out of love because of all that and didn’t know it? Is that possible? I started seeing a therapist and she thinks it’s all anxiety related and that I have to get to the bottom of that first but the thing is that the relationship seems to be causing me anxiety and I don’t want it to be. I want to be able to be happy again and be able to feel passion for my boyfriend. I wish these past few months never happened. My boyfriend and I were so in love before and I want that back!! If anyone has any input, it would be greatly appreciated. I’m not sure what I’m going through right now, but it really sucks! Has anyone else dealt with something similar to this? 0 likes, 13 replies "

I've come to the conclusion with my parents that I am depressed. My mother  has had her fair share of  depression aswell so I think it's genetic. I'm seeing a therapist now to help me get over it but it hasn't helped me all that much. My problem is  that sometimes I don't feel love for anything. I just feel nothing. I am straight I'm quite sure of that but still at these moments when I don't feel anything (I call them 'blowbacks') I can not feel anything for a girl aswell. At these moments I can't see myself loving anyone or feeling attracted to any gender, I feel asexual. During these 'blowbacks' my heart starts to beat super fast, I feel very nervous and get panic attacks and when I'm alone I start to scream and cry because I don't know what is happening to me and it  freaks me out, a lot. So much so that I get very suicidal during these blowbacks which last for 10 to 30 minutes. I am worried one 'blowback' will never go away. or that I will have these reocurring feelings of numbness and asexuality  for the rest of my life. Is this a common problem? Does depression cause this? Will it always be here or will these feelings go away? I just want to love someone again. With all my heart. Ben 0 likes, 10 replies "

I have also been through under eating, over eating, binge eating, losing weight, gaining weight, not dressing, not washing, lying in bed - crying at the tiniest issues - worrying about worst case scenarios in life, and also feeling so completely  lost as to what to do with myself. I get scared in life to the point of paranoia.  I imagine the absolute worst will happen - getting into trouble, ending up in prison, ending up in a vulnerable situation, homeless, etc, etc, etc .... I find it really hard to trust myself, let alone other people because I feel I have no skills to cope in life.  I feel tense around others and only peaceful when I am all alone in solitude .... but this is also very lonely and isolating place to be.   I feel a source of guilt in terms of any relationship with my family - because they have not been able to help me - they have not been able to aid in my dysfunctional mind and circumstances.  I have felt trapped, hysterical and like a I am verging on psychotic at times - shouting, throwing things, anger, tears.  All this has already been and gone.  I have visited psychologists in the past as well as psychiatrists - but they have never diagnosed me with anything else besides general depression and anxiety.  And as I am particularly well able to articulate my feelings and problems lucidly and with intelligence then they do not realise the extent of my problem and the absolute unbearable sense of fears, paranoias, misery I feel inside I think.  It's as though I have never fallen into any 'categor'y. I think this is because I have quite a variety of psychological difficulties that all merge into each other sometimes and of course feed off one another. Because I have managed to hang on (to all outward appearances) to some kind of sanity, they do not see the real picture of the chaos in my mind and body.  I have suffered 3 strange 'episodes' in the last 15 years where I have lost sensation in my body and face and it has never returned.  This remained something of a mystery to doctors and I was eventually diagnosed with some kind of neuropathy or anxiety related bodily symptoms.  Physical manifestation of anxiety even though some of them argued my symptoms were not typical or fitting.  These reduced sensations have never resolved or returned and I now live with reduced and diminished sensation including not being able to sense pleasure sensations like massages or orgasms, pain.  I feel adverse to sex and always have - somehow I (sometimes) find it a bit dirty and repulsive and feel violated and I cannot live with how I feel because I feel like a freak to feel that way without any reason that I can recall.  I have no history of abuse that I can recall - just an anxious mother with some depression and negativity in her own thinking.  Apart from this I have just been scared since always and have never had the strength or courage to pull myself out and I am now at my worst point ever and have given up on life and am just existing.  I have tried within my very limitied mental means to pull myself out by attempting life changes in the past but have been crippled by my own anxieties and fears and these attempts have ultimately ended in the same patterns of failure.  I lack any sense of ability or life resources, no sense of strength and I am aimless in life - feeling as helpless as if I were a newborn.  I do not see the meaning or point in anything and feel it so diffiult to think of anything that would make me want to see a glimmer of light and really try again.  Been there, done that before.  Already too tired.   I feel like I want a parent figure to come guide me step by step and pull me out from this hole.  But that is just ridiculous and the more I think of how I should be able to manage my life, the more ashamed I feel of my bleak and fearful reality.  I now find myself in a very stressful situation in life currently.  And I arrived here through my own desperation and hysteria to escape my last situation and lack of seeing any other way out - an out of the frying pan into the fire situation.  I have tried in the past medication, cbt, citalopram medication ..... I am so sad that I have come to this point but I do not know how to get better or where to begin ..... so much seems to have happened inside my mind that I am genuinely afraid that I have gone quite mad (but am still managing to pretend to be sane) ... I cannot cope with the vast amount of emotions and their intense strength that I feel in terms of everything seeming so dark, desperate, scary, chaotic and my mind just can't process it all.  Particularly it just all feels a lot of thoughts for a tiny tiny mind to have.  I just thought I would write about it.  I have been through a lot of weird phases, living on baby food for a while, labelling the calories on everything, Obsessive tendencies to tidy everything to the extreme just to have an element of control in my life .... I have a problem with OCD where everything in my home has to be perfect and tidy and straight otherwise I feel very anxious and restless and as though things are dirty or that I have lost all control completely.  If I lose the ability to control even my home or food then I feel I will have absolutely nothing since the rest of my life is so far gone.  But the pressure this extreme thinking gives me is unbearable to live with and makes me tired and cry when I don't match up to my own pressure and standards.  I take ages to get ready every day on the days when I feel able to try and go out because I feel I have to put on a pretence of appearing respectable and 'ok' .... the reality is sometimes I cry, shout, like a toddler who can't handle adult life and who can't dress herself or manage her well-being and life.  Afraid.  Lost.  Unmotivated.  My mind wants it all to go blank.  I want peace.  Feel a complete loser in life.  Just want to float away quietly on a cloud or sleep and not wake up sometimes and just drift off into a haze where the last thing I think about is something uplifting and peaceful and far from the reality of this overwhelming life.  I feel guilty to myself and to the world for being this way.  The only way my stupid dreamy mind sometimes justifies it is to pretend I am a fairy from another world who was made perfectly but has come to an imperfect world and cannot hack it because it's too far from my own world.  And I imagine this particular thought in a sane way, not an insane way ... I realise I am not really this person but this is the best way I am able to get any comfort in how I feel in this life. 18 likes, 174 replies "

I've been prescribed Zoloft to start with 12.5 mg 5 days, then 25 mg 5 days, then whole. It's been months and so far I have only been taking 3-4 mg (a tiny bit of tablet). One night I have taken maybe a little more, about 6 mg and had a panic attack in the morning. I've convinced myself that it is because of Zoloft and cannot bring myself to take anymore. I am also terrified  of the black box warning, but the increased anxiety is something I think I could not handle. I'm afraid I'll end up calling the ambulance and they'll take me to the hospital (which I am also terribly afraid of), and then I would have to move because the neighbourhood stories and stigma regarding mental health. My family is also all over me with the phonecalls and questions everyday is it better. I am unemployed, my wife is only working and me and my daughter stay all day together reading positive reviews and gathering courage, but when it comes to that moment I just cannot take it. I am afraid I will ruin their and my life is something because of the tablet. Please help, I want to be a better husband and father, to work to be happy, healthy, but I am just so scared I wont be able to go throgh the side effects. Is there any way to minimize them by starting perhaps on 6.25 then upping the dose slowly...is it possible that I have had a panic attack from all the thinking and not from zoloft? Please if you have any advice I would be very thankful. Best whishes to all you dear people and stay healthy! 0 likes, 4 replies "

Depression,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-am-lost--698744,I am lost... ,"I am a 21 year old male who has lost most hope in life. Most, because I can't kill myself yet, due to many people feeling bad about me doing it.  I cut myself sometimes to stop feeling the pain; however, it always comes back. I am extremely self-centered and can't stop thinking about myself. I fantasize about suicide on a regular basis and there hasn't been a day in a while when I didn't fantasize about killing myself. I am writing this, because I still have hope that maybe I am not such a piece of s*** that I think I am. In all honesty, it brings me joy to help people and whenever I feel more or less well, I feel sorry for many of them. Of course, this, then brings even more pain. I am still a virgin, I had a chance to lose my virginity, but I couldn't have sex with her, I didn't feel like she was right for me. It's awful to say that... I know. I am not that attractive, even though my mom tells me I am. Girls do not usually talk to me that often, sometimes I get a chance, but I screw it most of the time. I met a girl, that I really liked (loved, most likely), but she is going through some serious stuff of her own and is not looking for anything. I want to say that if she is happy I am happy, but I can't. I cry, because I realize that I can't have her. What type of ahole am I? She doesn't want me to kill myself. We are friends. At the same time, I feel like she doesn't want to talk to me anymore. I don't blame her, to be honest. I wouldn't want to talk to me, as well. I can't masturbate often, even though I realize that I need it. Maybe 2 times in 2 weeks, if I could reach orgasm, but lately I couldn't even do that. About the girl, she is so beautiful. I didn't like her that much before we met. But after we met, she would invite me to her dorm to hang out and stuff and I felt happy. She tried inviting me to her room and I felt like refusing, because I don't want to make her unhappy -- although, I think it was just a joke. I have a friend, who is really attractive and they always talk with each other -- I feel envious (I don't want to feel it). Yesterday, at the party, at my house -- I decided to go outside to basically feel sorry for myself. My friend and her went out to see me and talk to me. She explained that a lot of people love me. That was a surprise for me, I didn't know that anyone loves me (besides my mom). She started saying that she feels awful about herself, because she doesn't have any talents, like me or my friend -- even though I am not that talented. She started tearing up and my friend started tearing up -- I couldn't cry, I felt her pain, but I couldn't feel it at the same time. My friend told her that there is god watching over us and that we suffer to make the world a better place. I agree with him, I think... I hope.  She was talking about her awful life and problems (I don't want to talk about them, here) and he talked about his. I've noticed how she was looking at him and it brought me pain. I didn't want that to be the case. I wanted them to be happy together, but my brain (stupid white, gray neuronal mass of garbage) was jealous of that. All of the attention focused on me. I couldn't take it anymore, so I showed her the portrait that I made of her. I think she liked it. However, I realized it was a mistake. Confessing my feelings like that. I am such an awful human being. After the party, they went back to their place and she called him, but due to him being a nice guy he invited me as well (there were other people with us). He knows that I am in love with her. He didn't want me to feel the pain. I guess it was obvious that I was pretending to be happy. They went into her room, but he dragged me in. I felt awful and was trying to get out of there. I forced myself and other people to leave, even though I knew I didn't want to, but the heart told me if she is happy with him, then I am happy. I went back home and cried for at least 15 minutes in my bed. All the self-hate came out and I felt immensely sorry for myself. So now, here I am typing this essay, when I can actually do productive work.  I would kill myself, in all honesty, but apparently others will follow my path if I do that and what kind of person would I be after that. I hate myself. 1 like, 2 replies "

(By ""recently"" I mean the last few years, I was first diagnosed 45 years ago.) These days I sleep quite well at night, but even so I often fall asleep during the day, which I guess might be age-related. That's not the main problem. What is, is that very often when I waken my mood is   lower than it was before falling asleep. Most often, I've been asleep just for a short time. Very occasionally, I'll wake in the middle of the night feeling this way, but it's usually during the day, after a short doze. It happens something like 1-2 days out of three on average. Sometimes I'll feel better after say 20-30 minutes, other times it will take hours, occasionally a day or so. I've spent a fair bit of time googling but haven't found anything so far.

Due to me being overweight and having low activity levels I was concerned about type 2 Diabeties do went to mu doctor and had a hba1c test done - my number was 32 so my doctor said that was fine (i didnt mention my funny episodes to him at this time) once i knew i wasnt diabetic or pre diabetic i was trying to find out what my symptoms were and kept coming acriss things to do with low blood sugar so i bought myself a glucose monitor and test strips so when i did feel funny i could check myself. i found that when i was feeling horrible my blood sugar was around 3.4 - 3.7 and the rest of the day it hovers around 6-7. Im only having lows between my breakfast and lunch - this seems to be regardless of what i eat for breakfast but i am becoming so anxious about having a 'hypo' that i an eating more than i need to try and keep my blood sugar up (this is even more problematic when trying to lose wight) Everything i read online seems to be if you are overweight and dont exercise then your blood sugar would typically be high but i seem to be the opposite and this is making me nervous about what could be the cause? Has anyone else experienced this? Should i be worried or just buy some dextrose tablets and deal with the hypos when they happen? Thanks! 0 likes, 3 replies "

My last blood test, last week, showed that my HbA1c has gone up to 42 (6%).  An increase of 1 or .1% in 3 months. Now my GP has said I must only take 500mg a day.

Some have worked well for a while but eventually stop working.  My  latest trial was kelp and dark green vegetable juicing.  That gave me good results, but juicing takes a lot of time and is messy, so I wanted to find out what is in these vegetables that is helping.  It appears to be potassium.  Almost everyone is low on potassium and it is very difficult to get the recommended amount of 3000 to 4000mg per day.  For that last few days I have gotten good results from taking 2 potassium supplements with every meal that is not vegetables.  Each tablet or capsule is only 99mg so it would take alot to get up to the min daily requirement.  But it is still helping.  I always take it with food to avoid stomach upset, which is common with potassium.   I have 4 different potassium supplements so I don't depend on any one supplement. One is just powdered kelp. I also noticed that some blood pressure medications are potassium based.  Modern diets are full of high sodium ""foods.""  Is it possible that by this high sodium diet we are causing diabetes ?  I also try to use sea salt whenever I add salt.  It has potassium in it.  Table salt has only sodium chloride.  Preserved foods have the same or sodium nitrate.

Examples of this would be fruit juice, herbal teas, squash etc.) As a starting point, about a year ago I was drinking about 1.2L of hydrational fluid a day, but about 2-3 months ago, I was advised to start taking supplements for CFS by a nutritionist, so I thought it'd be a good idea to up my fluid intake as well.

We have experienced much success working with some open-minded, individual doctors, who are prescribing naltrexone or nalmefene whilst we are providing the aftercare support, but many doctors just will not stray from local NHS guidelines which tells them to refer potential patients onto locally commissioned Alcohol Recovery Centres (ARC). We would like to tackle the 'warmer' leads first - that is those organisations that have prescribed naltrexone or nalmefene for use with The Sinclair Method. So, if you have been prescribed either of these medications from your local ARC, please let me know which organisation it was (eg Addaction, CGL, Livewell, etc), and which town. If you prefer to PM  the information, then please do so. This is going to be incredibly time-consuming and frustrating for us.  The very first ARC I contacted yesterday replied to say thanks, but no thanks because they don't prescribe these medications..... and that is despite the fact that the local NHS has clearly stated to me that they have commissioned this particular organisation to do so!

Alcohol Consumption,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/very-unusual-drunken-personality-698831,Very unusual drunken personality,"Drunk and stupid is a thing I've done dozens of times. I usually drink responsibly, I have friends hide my keys and phones (especially after some how drunk texting some guy in ancient hebrew), and for the most part I'm a cuddly happy drunk. However, as of a few nights ago, after a much smaller amount than usual drinking nights I completely blacked out. And by blacked out I mean about 2 hours into a night of drinking my brain shut off and some demon drove my meat suit around making a total ass of myself to everyone I know. Now to clarify,  99% of the times I've been drunk and disorderly there's been some bit of memory, control, remembering drinking, or at least a feeling or personality traits blown out of proportion. This was like someone literally turned a switch off in my brain. All of everything, completely black. Now I've blacked out before but it requires lethal amounts into the realms of alcohol poisoning. (It should be said here, I'm not a lightweight drunk. A bottle of whiskey is a calm tame night for me. This was like a quarter of a bottle at best.) But, that wasn't the case. As I said, I'm usually a responsible drunk. I was with about a dozen people. They said I passed out on the table and woke up someone else. Someone even called a poison control hotline thinking I had been drugged. Now aside from my violent, punchy behavior that turned me into a total jackass. Once most of the people left, I apparently turned into a hyperactive child stunt devil, then once I was home, a gymnast, once I was in a bed, a chatterbox. If I didn't have people looking out for me I'd probably be dead or in jail for the list of s**t they told me I did. So the current views are I was either drunk or drugged. The question in all this comes from this, I've drank before, I've been a stupid drunk before, I've even drank til I blacked out before. This.... this was a whole other ballgame of f* ckery. I've never done anything like this. In 20 years of nights out, bar fights, drunken shenanigans, one night stands, and I'll even throw in weird s**t like sleep walking and waking up standing in a corn field at 3am, this has never happened before. If I didn't have witnesses, I'd probably just have shrugged it off but I've NEVER had this kind of personality issue before. I assume the stories I might get from other people range from I had a burp once to we piled into the station wagon, hit the ramp doing 100 and thought we could make it to the moon but the barn got in the way. (not to make too much light of other people's experience just shortening answers) What I'm curious about is, has anyone had severe personality issues as a result of drinking or was I drugged? The reason I ask is that there was one person at that party that easily could be a culprit in all of this but I'm not one to go blaming people because it's convenient, or even obvious. I've not been drugged be..... I've not been drugged by SOMEONE ELSE before. Nor have I blacked out so quickly. Nor have I had such wild personalities swings. Nor have I taken physical actions against other people.  - Come to think of it I have had one similar case a long time ago when I was put on an IV and put to sleep for surgery. When they removed my wisdom teeth they had to dope the every living s k out. But I was a loopy assh* le for hours after that doing the most random s t or anesthetics not working at all (no really it's been a serious issue with dentists and surgeons). So the more I think about it the more I worry it was someone drugging me. I wasn't/haven't been on anything stronger than a prilosec for years. And definitely wasn't on the night in question. Granted it could all be paranoia but I've never had booze do that to me. I can not stress how much that meat suit walking around wasn't me at the wheel. Now the good part of all this is, yes, I've received ""the talk"" from about 15 people. I've had made about two dozens apologizes and there's at least one person who may never speak to me again. I've got people helping me with this.... oddly enough more people helping me with a drug/alcohol issue than help with any other issue... then again this was a public display for the most part so there's more.... concern when people see issues up close. I'm rambling, what I'm leaving for question is, has anyone else ever had extreme personality switches despite a history of drinking but never being as unusual or wild from a calm night out? Have you ever had these extremes from drinking FAR less than you usually would? I think I'm going to post this in the mental health section as well, to cover my bases, as I said I suspect foul play but it could just be my brain fracturing, maybe. 0 likes, 0 replies "

I went through hurricane Harvey, lost my cats, and lost several temp jobs that I thought would go perm. In April of this year I was in the hospital with gastritis. I was there for 4 days Harley ate hardly slept.  Did not do my body well at all. When I came home that is when the insomnia began. I took benadryl, melatonin nothing worked. Went to my doctor they gave me trazodone, klonopin. I started developing anxiety and depression because of lack of sleep. I did not like the side effects of some of these meds. Doctor want to put me on antidepressants which I refuse to take. Went to several sleep doctors one wanted to do a sleep study. I don't have sleep apnea. Finally I read that if your body is depleted of estrogen this will cost symptoms of anxiety depression and insomnia. I went back and saw my old GYN last week. He wants to get me back on the estrogen which I now I'm on it's been a week. He had me on another hormone called progesterone which I take it night and it's supposed to help with sleep but not much he says I could take 6 weeks of full effect. When I saw him that day he did not want to do blood work on me which kind of upset me because I wanted him to. Then a few days later I noticed my lab results from the hospital has showed that my thyroxine T4 was slightly high I guess it wasn't too much of a concern the doctor would have said something. It really kind of bothering me about my thyroid but now I've been reading a lot about the adrenal glands and how stress has a big part on it. I made an appointment see an  endocrinologist. I am not sure if it's high or low cortisol that has an impact on insomnia but then also not being on estrogen for so many years and  going through so much stress. During the day when I'm so tired and want to nap I can't shut my mind off. I've heard about DHEA I don't know the doctor can do a test for that. Any advice you have I really appreciate it currently I am just taking Premarin and the day and progesterone at night. I'm wondering if there's anything that I could take like a beta blocker or something.  I don't have my bloodwork back yet from the GYN hopefully that will say whether or not I have a thyroid issue if it's not a thyroid issue what would the endocrinologist do? 0 likes, 3 replies "

I have seen numerous specialists and doctors in hopes of getting this resolved, however, I get no answers.  On December 4th, 2016, I awoke believing I was having a heart attack. It was hard to breath, my heart rate had spiked, I was nauseated and dizzy. I went to the ER and they told me that it was anxiety. For the next several months, I moved home from college and rested my body there. However, my symptoms continued to escalate.  Here is a comprehensive list: 1. Irregualr heart rate (sometimes fast and sometimes very slow) 2. Not too often, but muscle pain 3. I got sick a lot this past winter 4. Vomiting/nausea  5. GI issues like abdominal fullness, diarrhea, and burning   6. Mostly pain on the left side of my body like down my arm and leg (also below my left eye down my cheek bone I get an odd sensation, almost like numbness) 7.Dizziness  8. EXTREME fatigue and body heaviness  9. Forgetfulness 10. Anxiety/constant sadness  11. Menstruation issues ( irregular, used to be heavy but this past one was very light) 12. Headaches and head pressure  13. Feeling of blood not circulating  14. Mysterious bruises  15. Random paper cuts 16. No ambition  17. I did have weight loss this past winter, however, not noticing any now Since December of 2016, I have been to the Er 5-6 times, I have seen my OBGYN twice, I have seen a neurologist, a cardiologist, tried Chinese medicine, seen my GP numerous times, gone to a gastro specialist, and tried counseling. Every doctor claims that this is anxiety. However, I cannot believe that. I j=have had so many blood tests done (cannot even exactly tell you each one I have had done because I have had so many), an MRI/CT of my head, a 30 day heart monitor, and echo of my heart, a colonoscopy/endoscopy, a spinal tap, etc... and nothing has been found. I have noticed that my symptoms do get worse on my period. And I have noticed that my symptoms stay for a period of time and then will disappear and then come back, Recently my symptoms have stayed consistent since this past Memorial Day.  I was thinking about getting my hormones tested because I am not sure if they have been in the past, despite all the blood work I had done. So today I was researching hormone imbalance symptoms and Addison's disease came up and frankly, I am terrified. I have read a lot of stories about girls my age who have been misdiagnosed by doctors saying they have anxiety for years and then all of the sudden they go into adrenal crisis and die. I have no where to turn to anymore because no one believes me anymore. Recently, I have had the most chronic fatigue and dizziness and I can hardly do anything.

I am an 18 year old male, nursing student, who has been very energetic and played travel hockey and baseball my whole life.To explain my whole situation I need to go back about 2 years to When I was 16. For most of my life even though I was very very physically active , I’ve always been not fat but chubby and could never really lose weight. At 16 I started to notice and become really fatigue. I felt very tired and sluggish while also dealing with minor muscle aches. I started to loose motivation, I started to get mood swings and feel depressed. I also started to notice a “Pressure” type of feeling on my upper left abdomen, right under my diaphragm going from the center out to my left ribs. At sometimes I can feel or move around what feels to be a lump. It’s not really pain, but ever since I’ve had a very weird pushing feeling that either feels muscular or deeper than that. It’s hard to feel for others but everyone knows their own body. Most can’t feel a “lump” but they do agree that’s its very tender feeling. Anyways, I went to 3 different doctors, my Primary Md, my mother’s Oncologist and a 3rd to get an ultrasound. Had blood tests, urine dipstick, everything seemed Normal with 1/3 doctors saying “ I do possibly feel a small benign mass” but it was never seemed serious by him and was never followed up. Another doctor told me I had GURD or acid reflux and prescribed me acid meds. MONTHS GO By, the feeling is still there In my upper left abdomen reaching around my left side to back pain and tightness directly behind or dorsal where the “Pushing” feeling is on the front and I’m now feeling even more fatigue, weak, unmotivated and depressed. now, One night I come back from the gym. (I have always eaten relatively healthy, not abused drugs or alcohol, and drink TON of water) and this night was no exception. I go in the bathroom to brush my teeth, all of a sudden I get EXTREMELY DIZZY, I faint and hit my head on the Bathtub, luckily my girlfriend was there. I was only out for about 10 seconds but it was the first and only time I have ever fainted. Once my girlfriend got me up, I was feeling almost fine, addrenaline pumping, I asked her to grab my pop and rice because I thought I could be diabetic based on the constant fatigue and lack of energy. Following that night, my anexiety skyrocketed and it stills is a year and half after. I went to 3 different cardiologists, Had several stress tests, ultra sounds, EKG and even The portable 28 day EKG packs. Besides very normal and benign PVCs or irregular heartbeat. I was okay. It’s been almost exactly a year since I fainted. I’m now 18 1/2 STILL feeling extremely fatigued, depressed, just completely not myself and it feels so discouraging. The pressure feeling is still there, but now , I’m starting in the past few months, to experience worsening and different symptoms. I now on top of the others, am starting to get a mild pain in both areas on my ribs around the kidneys, mostly and mainly the left side still. I’m 18 ONLY years OLD and I’ve been experiencing severe erectile dysfunction and lack of libido. I eat extremely healthy, and my weight will fluctuate very fast, not too dramatically, BUT I’ll never loose fat. I could loose 20 pounds but not really gain muscle or loose fat and look the same. I have also been have frequent urination, (Mind you I’m a college student who drinks a ton of coffee but also a ton of water) so it’s expected but it’s more so the fact that my urethra always feels like there’s urine in it still. No pain or burning but a lot of leakage after urinating , and sometimes , mostly at night, it’s very hard to start peeing or “push” . With all of this weird influx and combination of physical and emotional stress and feelings, I’m lucky if I sleep 3-4 hours a week. I’m a college student guys, I don’t feel like the motivated out going person I used to be anymore, and it just kinda changed out of no where. Im tired of all of these people kinda telling me what’s normal or what’s going on with me when I know I feel different or it’s not what they think. I’m going to my Primary Again in a couple days to get a new blood panel, hormonal tests, urine analysis, prostate exam, and then gonna get refered to a urologist. I guess I’m just seeing if anyone has heard of this before or felt like this. I’m tired, I feel like I’m a 60 year old man sometimes with how sore and tired I am  ,and with the lack of Libido, urination problems (which both have been more recent).

For years I've had the following symptoms: -excessive thirst (always thirsty/cotton mouth/dry throat, never feel quenched) -frequent urination (I'm drinking a lot) -Hair loss, front center hairline thinning (noticeable) -chronic constipation (always dry/rocky--sorry) -dizziness, feeling unstable -easy bruising -abdominal pain (often stabbing or like lightning bolts) -easily fatigued muscles -occasional heart palpitations/feeling like heart is pounding -constant post-nasal drip (allergy medicines do nothing) -constantly burning, watery eyes, sometimes causing vision problems -no libido -cold hands and feet -fatigue, sometimes exhaustion -stomach bloating In addition, the following symptoms occur very frequently (some seem to come in waves and occur together): -diffuse joint pain -headaches -mood swings -cystic acne along lower cheeks and jawline -extremely itchy spot on outer right thigh, no rash I have recently done the following tests: -CBC: marginally low WBC, not significant. Otherwise normal. -HGB A1C: 4.8, est avg glucose: 91 -all other standard blood tests were normal -Vitamin D was low earlier in the year, but I corrected it with supplements -Rheumatoid Factor/C-Reactive Protein/Sjogren's/ANA/ESR: all normal -Complete metabolic panel: normal -thyroid antibodies: normal (TPOab was 44) I went to an endocrinologist the other day, who basically shrugged and said she couldn't explain my symptoms. She ordered TSH (again), T3, T4, as well as another metabolic panel + antidiuretic hormone, but she told me she expects all of these to also come back normal. I can't imagine that feeling the way I do is normal...especially considering that my lifestyle is very healthy. I'm a very normal weight (BMI 20), I eat a completely vegan diet (mostly whole foods- avoiding processed foods, added sugars, all oils, and watching sodium), I work out regularly, I drink only water and the occasional herbal tea...I should feel amazing, right?! I will say that I've been on birth control most of my life, and I'm currently weaning off of it because I think it may be contributing to at least some of this. I've gotten off once before, and it didn't go well...so I went back on. Has anyone experienced anything like this and figured it out? Or am I actually normal, as my blood tests thus far indicate?

Adrenal Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/scarry-dizziness-low-cortisol--522902,Scarry dizziness… low cortisol?,"Hi Summary: I was sent to ER and diagnosed with adrenal crisis. When i was discharged several days later this diagnosis was disputed. I still have issues of hypoglycemia, blurry vision and dizzy feeling. For the last few days i am also having skin issues, respiratory issues and mouth cavity inflammations - feels like my immune system isn’t working. My only guess is it could be adrenal insufficiency/fatigue but cannot get tested for it at present. Judging by what i have written below would you say my guess is likely to be correct. My background: - I used to never (EVER) become dizzy - I am (was prior to this) extremely active - Work all my waking hours (prior to this) - Considerable caffeine intake (been off for 7 weeks now) - Get approx. 8 hours of sleep per day - exercise 5-7 days a week (did prior to this) - Very skinny - Never had any blood sugar issues (prior to this) - For several months now i have been feeling very tired and had ‘’brain fog’’ Onset: About 5 weeks ago i started getting dizzy. It started very suddenly without a warning one midday - i turned my head aside and the room started spinning around. At the same time my vision got blurry and i felt like i am going to pass out. This was also accompanied by an extreme ‘’hot flash’’. This subsided in a matter of seconds but for the majority of the remainder of that day I felt like i was dying. Other symptoms also appeared: stomach and intestinal pain, nausea, bloating (upper intestines), trembling and joint pain and the feeling of a pounding heart. It was so bad i could barely sit. Towards the evening i got better and hungry as never before. It felt at first like some kind of poisoning (i did drink a stingy/hot tasting goat milk the day before). For the next week i was feeling better most of the time (though always tired) but i had milder recurrences of the initial episode once or twice a day. Each lasted from 30 minutes to 2 hours then subsided. On day 6 i was feeling almost completely well but on day 7 the milder recurrences of the initial episode returned. They continued for 7 more days. On day 15 (give or take a day) i felt good for the first 2 hours (after waking up) but then became very tired, nauseous and had stomach and intestinal pain. I couldn’t eat nor drink due to the nausea. As hours progressed my symptoms were getting increasingly worse. Eventually i got hot flashes again and sweat was literally dripping from me (but i had no fever). In mid afternoon i became so weak i couldn’t even sit anymore and was taken to ER. When i arrived there i was vomiting acid and bail. I was drifting in and out of sleep. My blood sugar was 2 and potassium level was slightly below minimum normal. The working diagnosis was ‘adrenal crisis’. They gave me an infusion of water, glucose and some chemical (i can’t remember the formula). Later they also added potassium. For the next 2 days i was predominantly sleeping and was on water and glucose infusions. On day 3 i was up, but my muscles were so weak i could barely even swallow. On day 4 i was out of the hospital but my muscles remained extremely weak for 5 more days. Result: Doctors checked my heart and also did an ultrasound of my stomach cavity and found nothing wrong. For some reason they ruled out adrenal insufficiency despite not having checked my hormone levels. The problem is that majority of the doctors do not officially recognise anything short of Addison's disease and since they found no physical defect of my adrenals they ruled out any insufficiency. Besides slightly low potassium i also had (likely still have) low creatinine. My dizziness and blurry vision episodes continued after getting home. Eventually I started measuring my blood sugar every 2 hours and found it gets very low if i do not eat every 3 hours. And this also coincided with my dizziness. Current status: I am constantly eating to keep my sugar up and this fixed my vertigo. However i still get poor/blurry vision from time to time and a weird sensation at the back of my head which feels like the room is about to start spinning again. I seem to get these when i work for a while but not after short term physical effort. I do not know why and it is freaking me out. I used to never be dizzy. The second issue is i have random short periods (a few minutes) of what i can only describe as ‘’emotional weakness’’. And the third is that i have a few bruises that are still green after 3 weeks. Lastly, the last couple of days different mild infections have been piling up. Thank you for any help 0 likes, 11 replies "

There is a CCTV camera in my room and I recently took the video from it and turned it into a diagnostics video. Hopefully someone knows what this is. I'm a 17 year old trans-girl but medically male. I have Asperger's Syndrome (Autism) and depression. (Which doesn't help as this experience causes me suicidal thoughts). I don't smoke, I would rate my personal hygiene as excellent, and if anything I wash my hands too much. My diet isn't awesome as I'm a vegetarian and can't eat anything with a wet texture as it makes me sick. (Strange I know) It starts out with a hell of a lot of sniffing, followed by constant rhinorrhea with no breaks. (I'm not kidding; it's as gross as it sounds) Usually this is joined by a massive headache and dizziness. Things are too loud, things are too bright, my eyes sometimes see strange colours but not every time. Then comes WAY too many sneezes. In this particular instance I think I clocked 16 within just a few minutes. (Violent sneezes). Then it takes a while to calm down and I'm left to clean the mess on my face left by this mystery. My room is pretty full and has lots of dust so it's been speculated that this can be explained by dust allergies, but this has also happened several times away from home and even outside with no signs that it was gonna happen. But trying allergy tablets doesn't solve the issue. Nasal spray works sometimes, but I have to really be ahead of the game for it to work. Otherwise I just feel like I'm putting more fluid into my nose. Here's the link to the unlisted video if it helps anyone tell what I'm dealing with:  This usually happens mid-way through the week, and typically lasts 6 hours before disappearing without a trace.

I neti pot/use simply saline and gargle salt water as well. These things mildly and temporarily help...but allergies persist...24/7. Allergies became worse in 2015, and progressed into this. I have seen a doctor, she apparently thinks its terrible allergies. I had x-rays done of my sinuses and chest, she said everything looks normal, said my throat looks good. I can't go to an allergist because well, I have panic disorder with agoraphobia.

The doctor prescribed me singulair, but I will not take it since the reviews I've read, many say it makes them more anxious and/or depressed, and there is no way I can deal with those added symptoms at this time. I'm at my wits end. I'm afraid this will kill me. 0 likes, 3 replies "

Allergic Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/allergic-disorders-684001,Allergic Disorders,"I was diagnosed early Glaucoma in Oct, 2015.  For the last about 3 years, I have been using Azopt twice daily and Travatan once a day. My situation/eye sight still remains the same as when it was diagnosed. Travatan has been Ok for me since started using it. I started Azopt after trying 4-5 other eye drops which did not suit me due to being beta blockers. Reason being that my BP remains on the lower side; 120-130/60. Beta blockers further reduced my BP/heart rate, hence stopped and started using Azopt. For the last one year, I started   all over the body and since last 6 months itchy red patches have been appearing on my body mostly back which would disappear usually within 2 hrs or so automatically or some times with use if anti allergic tablet. I have been trying my best to ascertain the cause of this allergy by leaving various medicines/ eggs for some time (however never left any of the above eye drops; Azopt or Travatan) one after the other but have failed to pin point the problem so far. I again read the leaflets of these eye drops which say that various skin problems can occur with Azopt as well as Travatan. I plan to leave Azopt (which i suspect more) for 2-3 days to see what happens, similarly if Azopt is not the culprit then plan to leave Travatan for 2-3 days.

Allergic Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-girlfriend-is-allergic-to-something-around-or-about-me-please-help--453526,"My girlfriend is allergic to something around or about me, please help! ","Hello everyone. I’m posting this on behalf of my girlfriend who is having an issue related to allergy whenever she is around me or my house. I know this is a bit of a wall of text but please keep reading, we can use all the help we can get at this point. Also I’m posting this with her consent.  We are in a long distance relationship. I live in Europe, she lives in Asia. This has been going on for the past 2 years now, and during that time we’ve visited each other 4 times, usually for several weeks. The first time I went to Asia we met up and for the about 2 weeks that we were together nothing was out of the ordinary, no allergic reaction whatsoever. The second time we met up she came to Europe, and that’s when problems started. After about a few days she started to develop an allergic reaction.   The itch was pretty much unbearable so we went to get some creams and medicine at the drug store.  I’m not sure what kind of cream that was, but the medicine was the antihistamine ‘’cetirizine’’. Also we got a kind of eye drops that provided only temporary relief.  All of these things had minimal effect as the rash continued throughout that visit. As soon as she left here, her symptoms gradually disappeared over the period of 1 to 2 weeks. We started thinking about what could be the cause. We thought it may have been my fabric softener or detergent, so from that point on I changed to exclusively 100% neutral allergen free detergent so that that could not be the cause on my next visit. The third time we met up I went to Asia. Apparently I was carrying the allergen again because after 1 or 2 days her symptoms started appearing again. By this time I had been washing with the allergen free detergent for 1 or 2 months. The symptoms were exactly the same as the last time, however of somewhat lesser degree, but still enough to be very uncomfortable. To take some measures I started washing with her soaps and shampoos, and to be sure I washed all of my clothing again with her detergent. Also I avoided using any deodorants and stuff like that, despite it being in the middle of a hot summer. Also I don’t use any hair gels. Again her symptoms went away about a week after I left. Sometime later I went to Asia again to visit. This visit was kind of bad in general as we got flu for different reasons. Despite that, her symptoms reoccurred again after a day or two,  to a similar lesser degree like last visit. She went to a doctor and got some different medicine for allergy that worked only somewhat. Again her symptoms went away about a week after I left. Recently she got a general allergy test for the most common allergies. The results only showed around 50% chance of allergy for dogs. She has frequent contact with a dog which give her no allergic reaction. Also a very small percentage of allergy to cats. I do have cats in the house, but actually her family house has also had a cat since she was younger. She has never gotten a reaction from that cat, and no reaction recently still. So unless Asian cats and European cats differ greatly in terms of the allergens they carry, that also seems an unlikely cause. The test also showed a very small percentage for allergy to molds and fungus. As far as I know I don’t have those around my house, and I don’t see how I could have carried a sufficient amount of that to Asia in my suitcase.  Molds also seem unlikely. The test shows she is not allergic to pollen and dust mites, unlike me. I’m allergic to dust mites myself. On the internet I’ve been reading up about allergies to a protein in semen that some people have. This also seems unlikely. For reasons we don’t really have oral or anal sex down below, with or without condom (which would also eliminate latex allergy). I can say semen has made contact with her mouth, but no allergic reaction has developed in or around her mouth which would make semen allergy unlikely. As far as she knows she’s never had any allergic reaction to any kind of food. I really hope the allergy is not the result of some sort of psychosomatic response. (perhaps in combination with some otherwise harmless allergen). I wouldn’t really know how we could deal with such an allergic response. Is there maybe something we overlooked? Some other possible causes that come to mind? She will be visiting again soon and I really hope we can prevent her allergies this time. Many thanks for all the help and advice you can provide. 0 likes, 38 replies "

I’m a young woman who has some health issues (asthma, respiratory/sinus-related issues mostly) but I never had any reaction to alcohol before 4 or 5 months ago. It doesn’t happen every time I drink, but there is at least a 50/50 chance that even with half a shot (or drink) I will quickly develop a flushed face. This can happen with every type of alcohol (tequila, vodka, champagne, beer, etc.). Sometimes it’s just a splotchy red chin/lower face; sometimes it’s my forehead, or nearly my whole face as well as my upper chest. The weird thing is that it’s very splotchy and random, not uniform—it looks almost like someone splattered red paint all over my face with a few large brush strokes thrown in here and there. Other than sometimes feeling hot or a slight tingle on my tongue (which could just be the strength of the liquor), I have no other consistent symptoms. But at times the rash looks HORRIBLE—very bright red; definitely could not go out and drink socially like that.

Female, 32 Weight 52 kg , Height 1.65m I’m having a lot of issues with my nose &eyes . My symptoms started around 4 years ago I’ve started to get small red  itchy patches on the different parts of body, they would  disappear normally within couple of hours. I was thinking it could be because of my work-it was very dusty and we had low quality dirty AC.  I went to doctors ,but they couldn’t help me much.I was given antihistamines –they didn’t work. It started improving once I’ve changed my job. At that time I lived in nice area  ,with woods around and fresh air.(It was my husband’s parents house) Me and husband bought a new flat 3 years ago .First 6 months seemed to be ok ,but then one day I started to have an issues with my eyes .Especially left eye : Runny, sometimes itchy &painful. I was thinking it might be temporary  and left it. I tried some eye drops-nothing helped.I changed my eye make up + stop wearing it for a while-still the same. Then it gradually started to get worse. My eyes was hurting (left eye is always worse) ,I’m struggling to get any drops in as it is very painful to touch. I was diagnosed with dust allergy. Were told to take antihistamines different drops . I’ve tried all of them-nothing helped so I sttopped altogether .Some days were better than others ,but I started to get used to it. Then 2 yrs ago I started to get eye pain ,like my eyeballs being squeezed (I had pain in my eyes before ,but not permanent –mainly in bright lights and using computers) Now it was there to stay. Deep pain &itchiness was there as soon as I wake up. My nose started to itch too.it’s annoying itching like someone constantly is tickling end of my nose and inside nostrils too. I got so frustrated as it’s there none stop !! This pain and itchiness. My vision is getting blury. I’ve seen many eye doctors ,but they keep telling me I have a dry eye symptom ,and allergy .But none of their advised medicine helps I’ve seen ENT too,.After few diagnostics he told me that my nostrils are very swollen and I have ‘koncha bullosa’ (middle turbines in nose grows abnormally large and they are filled with air also I have deviated septum .He prescribed two ops- to reduce turbines and shave my septum.He said it will ease my breathing ,but that is not my main problem and I said no to operation. He wouldn’t believe it is allergy caused issue. I have asked him to carry out allergy test. And again-I was allergic to dust. He said that op wouldn’t fix that. I got dehumidifier ,purifier ,allergy proof bedding ,removed all the carpets , cushions. I’ve had special dry eye tmt wich was £500 each-that didn’t help .My eye glands were checked and I was told that I have quite few dead glands in my left eye and more are dying . It might be environment  ,not blinking enough exct. I’m rinsing my nose with saline water ,applying hot/hold compresses . No I don’t do it every day .As most of the time I’m too tired and annoyed to do any of that, as it never helps! The only time it gets better is when I’m away on holidays! But as soon as i return –it’s all back My job is 8am-5pm in the office staring at the computer . Lights are very bright. It’s quite dusty here too My flat is on  the very busy road and gets very dusty very quick (we are thinking of relocating).I do clean regulary My main symptoms are : painful ,itchy ,gritty ,fatigued, sensitive to light eyes .Sometimes I feel like they are sweating . Itchy, swelling nose.Sometimes inside of my nostrils itch too. I have really bad fatigue because of this every day .As soon I wake up I can feel this crippling itchiness coming on and the eye pain. It makes me sooo angry and frustrated .I’m starting to make mistakes at work as I really really struggle looking at the screen. I feel very very unhappy. And that is the only thing I can think about.

Allergic Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/dental-allergy--519971,Dental allergy?,"Around five months ago now, I had dental work done. It was a composite filling, The moment the filling was placed, Something felt wrong, I had this strong burning pain in my face. Told the dentist but nothing was done about that, I went home and my cheek felt itchy and my eyelid on that side felt really itchy and it swelled, The next day I felt ill and noticed the gland in the right side of my neck swelled up, So phoned the dentist and went back. They checked and said they could see nothing wrong so consult my doctor. I had also noticed this strange chemical taste from the tooth which made it difficult for me to swallow. I became extremely ill over the first month, My neck tenced up extremely bad and I began having burning pain in my arms and tensed tendons, My stomach hurt like you wouldnt believe, I constantly felt like I wanted th throw up and the stomach felt like it was very much on fire, This went down into my intestines as well, My stomach and intestines also swelled up and I had constant gas for near two months or perhaps it was a bit long. So.. Here I am 5 months later. I have a constant throbbing in both teeth, Strange chemical taste at times that bothers my throat if I swallow it. All around my eyes are black and swell throughout the day, Arms and legs have these nerve twitches that happen quite often, I also have those in my face lately and alot of burning sensation throughout my body as well as itching, On the topic of stomach and intestines, I wont go too into unless someone asks I suppose, Vision has been blurry lately. And I know the first thing someone might say is it sounds like poisoning! Well within the five months I have been to the hospital atleast 9 times trying to figure out just what is going on with my body since the fillings. Nobody has had an answer for me. I have been to another dentist for a second opinion, First said it sounds like poisoning but realised no metal is in my mouth so said could be allergy but they are still not too sure. Even the Dental Pathologist I have been to see twice cant seem to figure out what is going on really. I also notice my mouth felt very hot for a long time, Eventually the gums swelled and became very red and now they are receeding extremely, A dentist I recently saw said it looks like gingvitis which doesnt make much sense as my mouth was healthy before all this, I am extremely afraid at this point to have anything done. I dont know what will happen. Also to note my lower teeth. Whatever is leaking from the top teeth got into two small cavities on lower teeth and very quickly they became huge cavities and it felt like whatever leaked into them caused irritation and then spread throughout the lower jaw. Any other info at all that someone might need do ask. I also at one point could not eat, Eating caused me extreme stomach pain so I ended up dropped down to 102lbs! I could not stant up or sit up without assistance. Could a systemic allergy cause things like this over the course of months as it is constant or might it be something far more serious that is not being detected? All I seem to do anymore is just sit in my room and cry. I really just dont know what to do anymore. Nobody can seem to help me but I cannot live like this. Any information would be welcome or any course of action I should take that I am just not thinking of would also be welcome.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/long-haul-flight-2-months-ago-665092,Long haul flight 2 months ago,"Hey everyone!  I visited my family in Canada from Tokyo about two months ago and had to endure two 14 hour flights. I'm 31 and had never thought about DVT or clotting before.  I'm 100% healthy, on no medications, eat well, and have never had a problem. Have seen people getting up and moving around the plane while I sat and just got up to use the washroom once every couple hours but that's what most people do.  Anyhow, when I got back to Tokyo immediately in the airport I felt a cramp like pain in my left calf that I thought would go away.  It didn't, it got worse.  Of course I Googled the symptoms and got completely freaked out.  I went to a ""blood doctor"" who took a d-dimer and general blood test and some other test. He said that I was all clear and there was nothing to worry about but I was still concerned. He gave me some blood thinners for a few days, and I had a bizarre anaphylaxtic episode to a sesame rice cracker that I'd never had in my life.  Perhaps some strange interaction. Nothing got better, I went to a muscle doctor who told me it was a bit swollen and to get an MRI which cost $100. I didn't go, instead went to another doctor who finally did a doppler ultrasound of my calf and saw nothing but ""beautiful muscle fiber"" I still have pain two months after that plane ride and everything seems to point to DVT. But there's no way it could get past all of those tests right?  0 likes, 2 replies "

Sometimes I’ll get a sharp pinlike pain behind my knee or the strange feeling in my leg. Today I had another 3 hour drive and on the drive my entire right thigh felt like it cramped up really badly.

Alendronic Acid,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/warning-about-alendronic-acid-639789,Warning about alendronic acid,"Today I attended the hospital where I saw an osteoporosis consultant.  I am 72 and had been told that I had low bone density in 1999 and in 2005 was diagnosed at high risk of spine fracture and lower risk of hip fracture. A month later I was started on Actonel and was on it for seven years then changed to Alendronic Acid for another three years, so ten years in total. I decided to stop it in 2012 as I had been on it a long time and was also getting aches in my thighs and muscle weakness where my leg would suddenly give way. Two years later, while still off the tablets, I slipped in the garden and broke my femur and had a femoral nail inserted and was put back onto AA for another three years.  In September 2017 I stopped again as I was getting aches in my thighs and occasional muscle weakness like before and anyway, I had been on it for three years so decided I would have another ""holiday"".   As I said, I saw a consultant today who was concerned about the pains in my thighs as it could be a sign of a ""rare"" side affect of AA where it causes fractures of the femur called atypical thigh bone fractures.  They occur after little or no force and in many cases there is a history of pain at the site of the fracture, in the thigh or groin for a few weeks or months prior to the break.  He sent me for some x-rays and when I went back into his office he told me that there was a very small horizontal crack half way down my femur that he now knew was DEFINITELY caused by AA and I was NEVER to take them again.  As if that's not bad enough, he's going to contact an orthopaedic surgeon to see whether I need a femoral nail put in my leg!   I have problems with my bone marrow that has caused low red and white blood cells as well as low platelets which are responsible for blood clotting so it may not be an option.  He said that atypical fractures are ""rare"", (it's something like 5 in 10,000) but he believes that there are people who have had atypical fractures that haven't been linked to AA at the time so not quite as rare as first thought.  He showed me a picture  of an atypical fracture and said that my fracture was exactly the same.  There is an osteoporosis treatment that I could end up having, it's called parathyroid hormone treatment (teriparatide) and is given via a daily injection under the skin for a maximum of 24 months.   As I have diabetes and inject myself four times a day this will be yet another injection!   I am expecting a phone call off the doctor in a couple of days, after he has found out what the next step will be.  I asked if I could do anything about it and he told me to keep taking the calcium and Vitamin D tablets and not to do anything like rock climbing or contact sports (just as if!!) and gentle walking rather than brisk walking as there's a chance I could break my femur with minimum force. (I read about a study done in South America about sudden femur fractures and 90% of the people were or had been on alendronic acid!) Sorry this has been a long message but this is to warn people who have been on AA or other osteoporosis drugs like risedronate, ibandronate, zoledronic acid and denosumab for some time that if they start to get pains or aches in their thighs or groins that they shouldn't dismiss it but see their doctor. It's only mainly been reported with AA but this could be because it's the most common treatment.  I hope this has been of some help to those who think taking AA is good for them, it isn't. 2 likes, 17 replies "

I have actually tolerated it quite well, though I dislike the morning each week when I take it. I also take Vit K2, magnesium, cod liver oil, Vit D3. I cannot take   as I have   but I have increased my calcium intake through food.  My fears have been reinforced this week as I have a bad   and will need to see the dentist.

I know an AA side effect was some horrible jaw tissue separation or something. This frightened me and I quit it. The little battle that goes on in my brain tells me this couldn't happen that soon!

Dental Abscess,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/root-canal-pain-years-later-605022,Root canal pain years later ,"Just posting this as a warning if you are considering a root canal. I have very soft teeth and have had around 4-5 root canals in past 15 years. Four of which have gone bad after thousands of dollars spent on root canal procedures and crowns...last fall 2016, I was in extreme pain with a tooth that had been root canaled and crowned years ago....and I had even been telling my doctor for several years now that the tooth was giving me pain. He brushed it under the rug and told me the X-ray showed nothing and the tooth was dead so it couldn't be hurting. So last November 2017 while in Florida on vacation, I was so excruciating pain. I ended up seeing a dentist there in Florida in the middle of the night..his X-ray showed huge abscess...gave me antibiotics and pain meds to get me home until I see my dentist. Meanwhile, the entire left side of my jaw starts swelling as well as my neck. Got home, went to my dentist and they acted like it was no big deal and just states that I should continue on antibiotics. I demanded that I wanted the tooth out. Found myself an excellent oral surgeon. He took a fancy 3D image and the abscess was HUGE! I needed emergency surgery to get it out. But the infection had already started moving into my jaw and down into my neck. Even after the tooth was extracted, the infection was still in my body. Major antibiotics were not killing the infection. I ended up needing a drainage tube placed up through my neck into my jaw area where the tooth had been to try and get the infection drained. Weeks and weeks I had to go back to surgeon. I now have a small scar on my neck but it's so worth it because that infection could have Jill's me. So please be careful. I now have another root canal tooth that is starting to hurt. I am going to dentist and demanding referral to oral surgeon for removal. I am not playing around anymore. Severe  tooth pain abscess is awful and so dangerous. I will need to get partial in back or implants. Hope my experience helps someone out there.

Almost two years ago, my dentist found a dark spot at root of one of my top front teeth, only visible on an x-ray.  He said it was either a dental abscess or a dental cyst and I needed a root canal. They did test the tooth and I felt nothing when they shocked it.   I waited to get a second option and finally had the root canal in December of last year.  I was told to wait six months and then they would check again to see if root canal had cleared up infection.  If not, they said I would need surgery and a biopsy.  This has me very scared.   I go back in in a week to find out and I am dreading that it is still there.  When I feel the gum area above my tooth with my tongue, it still feels slightly strange with pressure, like kinda numb?  But no pain.  This makes me think the infection is still there.  Could this be a cancer of some kind?  Any thoughts will help me. 1 like, 0 replies "
Dental Abscess,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/concerned-about-actual-problem-650913,Concerned about actual problem,"A few months ago I started having headaches on the left side of my head, achiness in my neck and the left side of my face was a bit swollen and I could hear my blood pressure in my left ear. I went to every doctor imaginable (PC, neurologist, vascular, cardiologist). I had several tests run.  Finally, on Friday, the vascular doctor looked at my CT with contrast test results and said, ""I didn't find any tumors, the test was not easy to read, they did it wrong, but I did see the veins in your left cheek are swollen. You may have an aneurysm in your brain or a AVM (serious condition in brain) and we need more tests to see what it is"". These tests, by the way, are semi invasive and dangerous. I, of course, panicked. On Saturday, I mentioned to my neighbor about it and that I also have to see the dentist for this abscess and bad tooth infection, which sucks. He said, ""where is the tooth infection and abscess""? I told him it was the top left tooth. He said, ""the one under your cheek and where all of your problems are""? My confused answer was ""yes"". He said, ""honey, you most likely don't have a serious brain issue, it's probably all because of your abscess and infected tooth"". I didn't realize, and to be honest, am still not convinced that an abscessed tooth and infection can cause a headache on one side of the head, neck ache and my cheek to swell up and my blood pressure to be heard in my ear. But, he insisted so I went on Monday to have my tooth removed.  They pulled it and gave me antibiotics. I am hoping with everything inside of me that was the cause of this. But I am not convinced.

As im highly anxious she recommended me to get some anti   meds to take before hand as ideally i wanted to be put under general but the wait was 3-6 month for referal. So i was having the extraction under local anastetic instead. Thursday came and i took the anti anxiety, had the local injections no problem hit the diazepam wasnt helping enough to keep me calm and i had a series of pnic attack whilst she was trying to extact the tooth. She managed to remove tiny segments as the tooth was just breaking when she was trying to do the extraction, less than half way through she decided she wouldnt be able to carry out the procidure as i was just too anxious and said she will put me on an emergency referal to get it removed at the hospital under general. SO she used the drill to remove as much of the decay as she could (didnt feel a thing at this point as she doubled my injections as i was in so much pain) and then used a temporary paste filling to close the hole to stop food getting stuck and lower risk of infection whilst i wait for full extraction. well, its now saturday, ive follwed everything she said- no biting on it/eating on that side, living off of soup and yogurt and mashed potatoe no problem. HOWEVER the filling has cracked and some has come away, and now the rest is lose and i think will fall out pretty soon. my only explaination is i grind my teeth when i sleep hence the crack.. im booked in for monday but im not sure what she plans to do to solve this and im wondering if shed be able to put a permanent filling in its place, so i have no risk of a temp one breaking again.. just to tire me over until the tooth is removed? . i currently have no pain but im not sure if that will be the case when and if the remaining filling falls out before monday. previously i had to take 3 courses of anti biotics as the infection caused by the tooth would not go away so im worried if she teplaced the temp filling with another temp one and it cracks again then i might be at a higher chance of infection. so does anyone know if it is possible/likely that she would give me a permanent filling for now untill the tooth is removed completely? we are not sure how long i have to wait for extraction and i dont think temp fillings are going to hold up bevausr its just paste and easily cracks with my teeth grinding... 1 like, 1 reply "

Communication. 3. Mood swings. 4.  . 5. Confusion. 6. He's having a difficulty following a story line. 7. Vision. 8.  . 9. Roaming/wondering. 10. Sleeping issues/disorders. When we went online and looked up the symptoms he was experiencing that's when various dementia websites popped up and as he was able to describe to us what he was going through it pretty much matched up word for word the lists in these websites, thats where I was able to get most of these, a lot easier then writing out his descriptions in detail of each one. My question is this. I'm pretty confident after reading some of these websites that once our doctor sees this list of symptoms he will refer my husband to whoever he needs to for the next step to test whether or not my husband has dementia and if so which one. I can say some of these symptoms were noticed ourselves but like my husband thought it had to do with his previous neurological issues. His communication, our daughter in law noticed 3 years ago that my husband would repeat words and pause while talking like his brain was doing a word search. The two big symptoms are his short term memory loss I know has become a lot worse over the last year and a half his communication now is a lot worse. When we read the detailed descriptions in the websites for dementia 9 out of 10 matched my husbands symptoms perfectly. I too am scared and worried for me and for him and for us.

We used to be big walkers going for long walks but now he can only walk couple of yards and he's wobbly and .oses his balance even though he now uses a walking stick he leans on me for support and he's had a few falls when it's been hard to get him up, even indoors the last few days he's been very unsteady on his feet, he walks very very slowly, also at times his speech is a bit slurred not all the time but now and then, he also gets very tired a lot of the time. Can someone tell me if this is a progression  of the VD. He has had heart scan as the GP thought he might have heart failure  but that was all OK. It's mainly his inability to walk very far and not getting about the house or out of a chair very well that's the main worry. 0 likes, 5 replies "

Dementia,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-ve-symptoms-neurological-symptoms-for-months-673217,I've symptoms neurological symptoms for months,"The last few months I've noticed some additional symptoms I've been having more then usual. I'm a 64-year old make. I've had multiple Ischemic Thrombosis & Lacunar Strokes, I've been diagnosed with Complex and Simple Partial Seizure Disorder, White Brain Matter disease, CSVD,  Cerebrovascular Disease, I've had a couple of heart attacks, 12-stent placements, Coranary Artery disease, type 2 diabetes, Peripheral Neuropathy in both feet and hands, sciatica in my lower back. Yes I have it all. Last March 2017 my Neurologist told me the reason for my short term memory loss is due to my strokes but he never explained to me anything about short term memory loss. I also deal with dizziness, headaches, balance issues and falling down on a daily basis. Over the past few months I noticed my memory loss was getting worse from last March. I would forget things that took place that happened to me in a few minutes or a few hours, I'd be having a conversation and forget half the conversation or forget things like why I'm in the bathroom or looking in the refrigerator. Months ago I don't remember how long ago, I'd tell my family that the words I want to say in my head by the time they came out of my mouth they weren't the words I had in my head and at times they would get offended so I wouldn't talk. Then over 4th of July my wife and I spent a few days at our sons house and before we left her said dad I need to tell you something., wherever you and I would have a conversation you continually repeated yourself, I never noticed it but the same thing happened with a friend I would send messages to, He would tell me that I just sent him the same message a few minutes ago. So I asked my daughter in law cause we live with her and our older son and she said that after we moved in 3 years ago she noticed I would repeat myself but just words and then I would kind of wander. She would wake up in the middle of the night and find me sitting outside on my walker, she knew I was outside for a while cause my hands were ice cold. I told her it still happens. Not all the time, I'd wake up and I'd be sitting outside or sitting on the couch or sitting on the bathroom floor. Then I finally told her and my wife about my memory getting worse like I'd be doing something and I'd end up going go doing something else and completely forgot what I was doing before. I been having major mood swings, one minute I'm fine and the next I'm crying. But the memory and now i can't even put together words in my head to talk to anyone so it's got to the point I just quit talking at all. I stay in bed all day, I feel safe in my bed I quit visiting my family or anyone and I told my wife if there was a way I could go to the bathroom in my bed I would never leave my bed. I'm down to 150 pounds because I don't eat, I quit reading because I have to read the story so many times to get it it's not worth it. These symptoms don't happen all the time but my memory my thinking my safety bed and things like that do now are all the time. Had anyone had these symptoms? 0 likes, 3 replies "

Dementia,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/help-i-m-scared-for-my-mom-637148,HELP! I'M SCARED FOR MY MOM,"Hello everyone, My mother is in her early 70s and is rather good health. She takes some medications for her acid reflux, her cholesterol, and her thyroid. She is a very active person, and is of a joyful and pleasant disposition. For the past few months, she's been complaining about recurrent forgetfulness. She was so worried about it that she asked me to handle her money. However, when she forgets things, she eventually remembers them a bit later.  When, I mentioned her concerns to her family doctor, I was told that the fact that I didn't notice any lapse in memory on her part, and that she can remember them eventually pointed away from dementia.  However, today she had a really frightening episode of a sudden onset of disorientation. We went grocery shopping, and when we got off the bus she suddenly didn't know where we were. She kept asking me where the mall was, when it was right in front of us the whole time. I took her inside, and at first she was just as disorientated. After about 10 minutes or so however she was fine again and was able to navigate the mall and remembered every item we came to get. When we got on the taxi to get back home, she again had an episode and thought the taxi was going there wrong way. Upon seeing a building she often goes to, she once again found her bearings.  Needless to say she is now petrified. After an hour or so, she asked me why she was so confused earlier. She even said that she remembers feeling confused, however she now can clearly see that the mall was right in front of us and all we needed to do was cross the road and go thought the parking lot. She even remembers the road the taxi took, but can't figure out why she was confused about it earlier.  We were both deeply shocked by the sudden onset of confusion. I'm wondering if this points toward dementia, or maybe something else?  I would really appreciate your input on this. Thank you in advance. 1 like, 12 replies "
Dementia,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/aluminium-hydroxide-693663,aluminium hydroxide,"I read the article on wind, halitosis & BO with interest. I was surprised to read the final bit about aluminium hydroxide. My understanding is that aluminium has been linked to altzeimers/dementia with prolonged contact. Where are people spraying anti-perspersperants? Under their arms, right next to large lymph glands.....potentially over many years! I've used Bionsen for years because it's aluminium free. Mitcham products USED to be ali free but don't appear to be any more. Read the small print on the product....aluminium hydroxide is usually mentioned first in the list. On a final note.....I worked in the Austrian mountains years ago. Opposite the hotel, at the very top of the mountain, was a 'chest' clinic for folk with breathing difficulties. Most of the incumbents were supplied by hospitals in Munich. The women I worked for used to be a nurse in a Munich hospital. She informed me that a lot of the patients had lung damage from using underarm anti-persperants for many years. On that note, I assume that hairsprays that contain a propellant might act in the same way.....never mind the hardening lacquer in the product itself!

Dementia,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-grandmother-s-dementia-675346,My grandmother's dementia,"In April 2016, my grandmother (79 now) fell in her apartment. She was never the same. Prior to that never really showing any neurological symptoms except mild delusions about workers in health community center and being lost in the city few times. She has diabetes, doesn't have dietary problems and her blood work is mostly allright. After the fall, it was apparent that she suffered memory loss, loss of movement in her legs, short term memory loss, hallucinations of dead or distant family members and inability to recognize her daughters and me, a grandson. She was put in a care facility and was prescribed Clozapine and Lorezepam (or Diazepam for a short while) and blood pressure medication. While in there she lost a lot of weight. Her eyesight was also getting progressively worse. Over the last two years there were ups and downs from the point of just not being able to move to the point of thinking that she's falling, talking to dead relatives and watching sheep almost at the same time. Overall her mental health was declining. Today I visited her and she was unable to completely move her legs or her legs to be moved as she felt a lot of pain. For the first time she was having difficulty talking and didn't talk unless she was talked to and then replying with yes or no, which is unusual. She only knew the names of her daughters and couldn't recognize voice or couldn't see anything except blurs. I could see every vein in her body due to weight loss. This isn't due to external factors such as refusing to eat or nurses refusing to give food to her. Do any of you have any suggestion what could be the cause?  0 likes, 0 replies "

First of all, memory problems are not the only symptoms I am experiencing, the other being a limited range of motion in both ankles, due to that difficulty walking, deformity of feet and now it seems as back is deforming due to weird posture and walking habits because of the limitation in ankles. I have been diagnosed with b12 deficiency a quite a long time ago, and I did get shots and also drank sublinguals for a prolonged periods of time, and now my levels are beyond the optimal. Then quite recently I was also diagnosed with vitamin D vitamin, which I am now drinking on and off (  I don't want to overdo it as I heard that excessive D vit in blood may cause Calcium def or something), and now my levels are sufficient but not optimal. So, my question for you all is maybe you have an idea what could cause quite sever memory issues in young adults ( I'm in my mid 20's, but the issues started when I was 20 year old) as well as these weird muscoskeletal symptoms like disturbed gait, pain in body etc. ( I tested for Lyme too as this illness is known to mimick thousands of other conditions, but the test came back negative). 0 likes, 3 replies "

It was very gradual, so it took some time before we were able really realise the changes. He has always been prone to nodding off easily but this started to increase, even within a minute of him sitting down, he'd be off with his mouth hanging open. He started to seem a little more vacant, and have more off moments staring off and not seeming very with it. He reported some light-headedness and fatigue and it was put down to getting older etc. (He's 71). Eventually he was persuaded to go to the doctor as he'd started to seem absent minded. He had bloods and urine tested and was found to have low B12, folate and low BP which he was on meds for high BP. Dr stopped the BP meds immediately and got him sorted with B12 and folate supplements which gave a marked improvement so we all sighed a sigh of relief. His BP and levels were 'fixed' it seemed though he was still not the same as before but we thought initially he just needed time to recover. Fast forward to recent months, his initial improvement went back to square one, however he's been retested and his B12 and folate are find, but his BP had gone very low again, so he's been taken off another prostate med which can sometimes have low BP as a side-effect. I've also read about links between prostate meds and dementia and the possibility it may unmask it sooner. He had a brain scan and was shown to have some small vessel disease but the doctor said it was very common in people his age. He also got tested at a memory clinic and has scored 70/100 on the ACE III test, for which I believe a score below 80 is indicative of dementia. He's vary variable, some days appears ok, other days he's got low level confusion, e.g. I'm buying my first house and he was telling me to make sure I got paid etc... his gait has changed, he doesn't lift his feet as much as he should and he stoops a bit too. When he falls asleep with his mouth open he drools on himself. It's very hard to watch especially as I think my mum struggles to be patient with him where his reactions and processing has slowed significantly. He told me he struggles a bit now with knowing the day/date and wanted to change his watch to a digital watch which has all of this information on it. Other times he can recall things in great detail that we don't remember or expect him to. He's still cracking lots of jokes as normal, but his connections in conversations have become more abstract, yet the connection is still there so not like he's just saying something random. I just don't know what else it could be. He has an appointment with the consultant as a result of his memory test. He's also on aspirin, Tamsulosin, Dutasteride,  Tropsium Chloride and  .

Headaches, dizziness and feeling foggy. Would this just be temporary since coming off one and starting another? I want to give it a few more weeks but I to feel better again. I’m almost ready to just deal with the coughing and get back on lisinopril so that my BP is stable. Any thoughts? 0 likes, 2 replies "

","Hello everyone, i am looking for some thoughts and advice about a health issue i have been battling for 8 months now. I am a 24yr old male and it all started back in july/august. Over 2 weeks i had 4 random episodes consisting of sudden overwhelming sickness usually followed by vomiting or gagging and sometimes a severe bowel movement or activity. Then one day in august shortly after getting up and eating normally it hit hard. had the same vomiting and severe nausia, but refused to stop all day and could not eat. The next day followed the same, vomiting and gagging shortly after waking up with added severe diarrhea, no apatite, shaking, feverish, weakness,   and  . This occurred every day for 2 weeks. I was absolutely dead, would spend most days sat and wandering about my land necking bottles of water. Eventually the diarrhea (replaced with sticky fowl smelling pale stools) and gagging/vomiting stopped. But the rest continued with general nausia and almost daily panic/anxiety attacks continued up and down in severity for 3 months causing me to loose about 2.5 stone over that time. During this time i saw 4 diffrent GPs once a week, was forced onto liquid meals for a while to counter the loss of apatite and weight loss the best i could. Went gluten and dairy free. Took over 10 stool samples which all came back clear except fecal calprotectin that came back 68 (told 0-50 was normal) 4   which were normal and ruled out celiac. Underwent a upper endoscopy and   which came back clear including biopsies. The symptoms toms slowly got less severe and 2 months ago managed to actually gain some weight back and had periods of feeling normal. But to this day i still suffer from abdominal pain and tenderness/soreness around my belly button especially after eating, tiredness, mild loss of apatite and nausia, bloating and gas and generalised anxiety and even over the smallest daily tasks especially eating. I feel that my doctors are out of ideas and classed it as ibs but with non of the following medicines greatly helping Colestid, mebevaline, Amitriptyline 10mg, buscopan, probiotics, slippery elm extract, lansoprazole, imodium. I am a ruined man. It has destroyed my life and am on my knees begging for help. 0 likes, 11 replies "

That didn't work. I went to another doctor, she prescribed Omeprazole. It worked like a charm. Unfortunately, the burping returned months later when I decided to do some situps. I felt gas bubbled up my neck instantly. The belching was worse and it came along with a burning sensation on the left lower part of my back. Sometimes I feel the middle of my back , on my spine , has mild pain. It burns whenever I sit upright but when I lie down, the burning subsides. I got Omeprazole again, and I hope it works.

About this time i started to see what i thought was blood in my stool. It would seep out like a soaked rag, red all the way through. I went to the doctor they did blood tests, stool tests. The pain was slight and i had no other issues. By January 2019 the pain had doubled, i now was not digesting food correctly, sometimes food would sit in my stomach for over half a day, leaving me bloated, burpy and really uncomfortable. At the end of January i had an attack of sorts, had a large fatty meal. My body shut down, my right side was in so much pain. I also just felt poisoned, my urine was also this dark red colour over this time.  The pain got so bad i had to go to hospital, where they said it was IBS and to go home. I Went back to the doctors, they did liver function tests, red/ white bloods, all the normal.  stool test for blood and celiac disease, all came back “normal”. I stressed that I thought this was gallstones or an issue with my pancreas and asked for an Ultrasound. It was a 3 week wait for my letter for the appointment for the ultrasound then a further 2 weeks for the ultrasound itself. A week after the ultrasound I had another attack, this one was worse. I had cured meats one night, and again body shut down.  This time there was vomiting, shivering, and huge inflammation from my stomach through my full intestines. My urine again was dark red. I had diarrhoea for 3 full days, every 15 minutes. I couldn’t eat, hardly slept. Due to the loss of electro lights my muscles started to ache and my toes started to curl and hurt. Started taking electro lights after this started to happen, stopped the muscle pain. The diarrhoea was red, then it was just mucus, red/orange. Every time I drank water, more mucus would come out of me. I tried everything to stop from continually going to the toilet, out of desperation as I thought this was going to be my life from now till I died, I took a steroid anti inflammatory that my partner had left over from a treatment. Within 20 minutes the diarrhoea stopped. The pain went down. And I could eat again. But I had practically no stomach acid. Anything I ate sat in my stomach, caused huge amounts of pain. Passing through me mostly undigested. At this point I was on boiled rice and boiled chicken. I bought stomach enzymes, bile salts and stomach acid pills. Food was now being digested and now I had solid stools. I waited two weeks for my ultrasound which I got the results over the phone, they said it was fine no issues. Then 2 week wait to see my doctor to go over the results. She didn’t have the scan, only the letter from the radiologist, which stated the size of my kidneys was normal. Which isn’t really what I had the ultrasound for. No mention of my gallbladder or anything else. I was told I might need to wait for another ultrasound, at this point she had no record of the tests in January. So I had to have them all redone as well. That was Friday the 29th of March. I am still in a lot of pain, my right side is really sore. I am still seeing what looks like blood seeping out my stool. I have stopped taking the acid pills, but continue with the bile salts and the enzymes. I have no pain lower down only my right side and my stomach. I had tests for a urine infection when I had my first attack as well as checking my appendix. I’ve also had tests for helicobacter pylori No signs of anything. The doctor after her about the lack of stomach acid, prescribed me omeprazole and peppermint capsules. I asked, if I feel as if I’m not digesting food, even to the point of supplementing my stomach acid, why prescribe something to reduce the stomach acid in my stomach. She said it would “create a protective barrier” which I’m not quiet getting. She has stated on every occasion that I have IBS and that’s that. When I said the highly localised pain isn’t a symptom of ibs usually. I was told that it can happen. Long term problems that might be import, maybe? in my late teens and early 20s I had random rush’s of adrenaline my heart would race for no reason, beat out of my chest. Then stop. They tested my heart, refused to test my adrenals. It got less frequent over years. Then stopped. High carb meals since 13/14 years old till today have made me drop a sleep for 12 hours plus once for 48 hours. I started taking modafinil in my 20s to stay awake. This was on off till I gave up carbs. Mid 20s I gave up carbs and went on a low carb diet for 5 years it changed my life I stopped falling a sleep and felt more present. Before this I gave up gluten. It helped but not as much as giving up a high carb diet. ive had to give this up since oct 2018. I have had ADD for most of my life, I have only recently been diagnosed as I now have the money to see a specialist. However the stimulants put me to sleep. No matter how many I take. I have been prescribed Adderall and Ritalin and Vyvanse, all of which have had no effect other than to put me to sleep. My doctor doesn’t really understand why. Since my mid 20s I have started to lose my hair and have scalp acne, it is almost constantly sore. I’ve tried every shampoo with no SLS or no additives. Baking soda. No shampoo. Etc. Everything you could think of. Nothing. Scalp feels soft, red, swollen. Any help with my failing body would be amazing. I feel as if my doctor wants me to just admit that this is it and not come back. But I’m seeing her in two weeks. So any help you can give me would be really beneficial.

Google calls this ""regurgitation."" I remember the moment it first started - I was doing a push-up at the gym and I almost damaged the workout pad I was using when a little bit came out of my mouth. So that tells me that what was coming up was fairly acidic. Fast forward to tonight - after eating too much oily beef broth for lunch, I'm finding myself nauseous, and burping up food to try to relieve the sensation. And I'm noticing something odd. What's coming up out of my stomach is not just beef broth, but also the walnuts I had for breakfast, and everything tastes exactly the same as it did when it went down. It's neither sour nor bitter, but salty and oily, with bits of walnut. This tells me that the walnuts I ate 12 hours ago are still in my stomach, completely undigested. I'm like a bird momma, except I don't have anyone to feed except myself. Does anyone have any light to shed on this? What's going on with my stomach? Should I see a professional? Aside from all the burping, which is quite gross to anyone but me I'm sure, the only ""symptoms"" I could name are the re-appearance of eczema on both my hands and extremely dry skin. Some would interpret that as a deficiency of some sort. Otherwise, my sleep is good, appetite is present, can't complain about bowel movements. 0 likes, 6 replies "

I discontinued use and couldn’t get rid of the nausea. I weighed 123 and I’m 5’5’ and I lost 15 lbs due to the nausea being so bad. I could have a few crackers a day and that was it. Over the next few months my stomach got a minuscule amount better but I was still plagued with constant nausea. I had my gallbladder checked and tried eliminating certain foods to see if they were a trigger but nothing seemed to help. This constant nausea continued until 2017 and was bad enough that it made it hard to keep a job. I felt miserable all the time. I only ever seemed to feel better when I would get super hungry, but the nausea would return full force once I ate. In 2017 I had a horrible week of nausea, then all the sudden I came down with a fever of 104°, agonizing body and joint aches, numb lips and hands and a splitting headache. This continued through the night. I took 2 Tylenol pm and woke up the next morning feeling so much better. After this incident my stomach seemed to have improved a lot! I could eat more consistently and the nausea, though still present, was lessened. I would still have some good days and some worse days, which always seemed random. If I woke up nauseous, I was nauseous the whole day. Flash forward to 2019. New Year’s Eve I suddenly had a fainting spell where I got incredibly nauseous, sweaty, couldn’t hear or see and it took a long time for my senses to come back. Once they did, I couldn’t stop shivering. These fainting/dizzy spells have now continued nearly every day and most often occur in the mornings. I’m struggling again with more consistent nausea and that on top of the fainting has me grasping at any strings I can find. I recently had an upper endoscopy which came back mostly normal aside from some light acid damage. If you have any insight into what this could be or anything that could help, please please tell me!!! 0 likes, 19 replies "

It is often worst when he first wakes up in the morning and eating usually makes to feel better. He describes the feeling sometime as being similar to feeling exremely hungry or like knots in his stomach (like being anxious) even when there is nothing anxious on his mind. It is worse when he is tired or stressed but can be sitting down having a a great relaxing time thinking of nothing to do with this pain and it starts up. Ultrasounds were clear.  He's had endoscopy, colonsocopy,  MRI and bloods were all good. He does have diahreoah often. There Is no difference with foods that we can find. We are desperate and grasping at straws so any ideas are very welcome.  Also he has been off work for 10 weeks because of this because his job is strssful and it is not better.

I've got horrible health anxiety, and right now I'm worried about  . Ever since I delved deep into the different symptoms, I found one that is easy to check - maldigestion. Basically, if there's a tumor in your pancreas and it blocks the pancreatic duct, then the pancreatic juice which normally flows into your small intestine to digest fats, is absent, and it causes a phenomenon called steatorrhea. So, since a week I have been inspecting my every single stool. I never did that before in my life, but I just have to now, to exclude maldigestion of fats. I've read about steatorrhea and it's characterized by pale, bulky, greasy and malodorous stools. My last three stools looked like that:   (it's an album of three photos, just scroll down if on mobile). Don't mind the floating pieces, they float for about 5-10 seconds only and then gently sink. They also don't smell foul. Do those stools look normal? I'm losing my mind. I Googled steatorrhea pictures, and while most of them really look greasy, I found a site at which steatorrhea is presented like that:  Now my   is beyond my limits, because my stools look kinda similar to that? I mean, I thought that's how normal stools look like, I'm really at my wits end now. My stools aren't pale, sink, don't smell foul and don't look greasy, but I just can't stop worrying about fatty stool. 0 likes, 7 replies "

I am 31, male, and health wise am pretty healthy. I do have big   and   issues and have been on meds all of my life for that. I exercise daily and eat a healthy diet. I don’t smoke and don’t drink anymore. I just quit in the past few months after too many over drinking situations where I got sick. I’m just done with it and it wasn’t a good mix with anxiety plus my career requires top notch condition to do well. Anyway, we will see if this is the right section for this but I have been desperately searching and posting for help. My doctor is no help and just prescribes meds. I’m currently looking for new doctors and hope to visit one ASAP. I just need help. Bad. It all started a few years back when I started getting sick while riding in the passenger seat. I never threw up but I would get to where I HAD to get out. The catch was this wasn’t on the road but at work where I teach performance racing driving. I can’t work programs where I have to ride now. It escalated and once I got sick driving myself on a track. Most say I dehydrated myself during the race and caused total exhaustion and nauseated symptoms but it felt like motion sickness. It really bothered me. The track was very hilly so a lot of up and down with moderate g forces. The past months I’ve started getting motion sickness easier. Even sometimes just driving on the road. I can’t ride shotgun on the road anymore for the most part either. I’m almost scared to do what I love now. So here are the most recent symptoms: -Motion sick when riding passenger. -Queezy Racing some and karts -Full/nauseous/queezy after dinners -Sometimes hard to fall asleep due to stress or unwell feeling. -Loud startling noise can cause   for a second quick burst of nauseous feeling. Even if wife coughs and I’m falling asleep. -Changing direction too quickly with head or tilting up causes a sensation similar to going fast over a jump in stomach. Not always but sometimes. -Sometimes nauseous after dinner and burp like food isn’t all the way down. Undigested or something. -Sometimes the sensation is almost a hungry stomach roll but hard to tell the difference sometimes in nauseous and hunger. My doctor says it’s related to my sinuses. He says my sinuses are swollen including in my ears causing the imbalance feeing. I don’t think that’s it. It’s something else. It has to be. He told me to take 4 OTC allergy meds all at once for a month (on top of the other drugs I take for anxiety and depression). I tried two for a few weeks and nothing changed. I don’t know if it’s anxiety, GERD, I’m broken, or even really is sinuses but it’s totally effecting my way of life and costing me thousands. I’m feeling hopeless by the day. Any help or even telling me this isn’t the right section and where it should be is greatly appreciated. 0 likes, 6 replies "

My blood pressure started going down not long after that so they gradually decreased my meds to what I am left with now. I am off nifidipine but still on 50mg atenolol.

My symptoms now; 1-Constipation and diarrhea, sometimes even in the same toilet usage. 2-Sudden urge to urinate 3- Double voiding - passing large amounts of urine, pushing on the lump/mass/bulge inside the vagina and managing to urinate again 4- Irregular periods (last period 1-10-18) 5-Pressure on the coccyx bone - feeling of fullness 6-Passing lots of rectal mucous 7-Intermittent vaginal bleeding -pink, red and brown 8-Extreme bloating 9-Cramps whenever I use the toilet 10-Not being able to pass stool without moving the bulge in the vagina. 11-Bulge in vagina, which I think may be connected to a urethral problem as it looks slightly swollen - Bulge expands when straining 12- Severe lower abdominal and back pain 13,- pain during sex I cant live like this any longer. I've vseen several doctors over the years who just gave me sachet drinks and suppositories. All of which made my symptoms worse, it wasn't until I broke down and said that i would rather be dead than in pain everyday not knowing what is wrong with me. It's also not fair on my children to see me crying all the time. They have done a vaginal and rectal exam which they said felt normal, my vaginal walls were a little thick but they couldn't feel the same bulge I could. I have had a transvaginal scan (pelvic scan) and all came back clear. I have a retroverted uterus but was told this was normal, along with a small fibroid in my uterus but was assured neither of these were causing my problems.

In January I developed constant Pvcs. Over 29 trips to the emergency room and a holter moniter later and i was prescribed propranolol for my ectopic beats. I have had all types of rhythm patterns associated with Pvcs and they all suck. I have also had many problems with my stomach for a really long time. I recently went under for an endoscopy and they have seen that I have peptic ulcers, not a problem, treatable. The very next day I started veripamil (calcium channel blocker) for my Pvcs as propranolol only does so much, and the first day I started the new medication, I couldn’t ease my heart rate. The next day I took the medication thinking it may be a medication change problem and the same things happened,  Fast heart rate, a few episodes of what I think were SVT and constant Pvcs. I went to my GP who told me to stop the veripamil and go back on propranolol until I could see my cardiologist. I did that and I noticed that the propranolol took away the anxiety but still didn’t take away the super fast heart rate. And then I realised with my phone cardio app that every time I lay/sit and then stand. My heart rate goes up heaps and stays up. So I went to the cardiologist and he tested me for POTS syndrome. Waiting the results until this Friday. If I have POTS, and beta blockers or calcium channel blockers won’t  stop my tachycardia whenever I stand, what other medications or medical procedures (ablation) can I do because I’m very worried that my heart rate will never return back to its former glory. I’m worried about my job, I stand all day and I’m worried about my life being over. I’m scared that my heart rate will never go down, any help is much appreciated. 0 likes, 0 replies "

I like to exercise but as soon as I take it im scared to do anymore exercise like cycling. Is it OK to exercise once you take one. 3. I was thinking of withdrawal from propranolol just to see whether I can hack not being on the medication. However Im a bit too nervous about coming off in case of unwanted withdrawal effects it says on the packet you can't win ha ha. If anyone has withdrawn from these tablets. Please let me know how you got one with doing it. Like I say I was put on them for anxiety caused by glandular fever. No heart issue just the anxiety.

I have recently been prescribed   XR, 130 mg to treat tachycardia and panic attacks. I have been taking the medication for one month as of today. I was prescribed the medication after a two day hospital stay, during which a twenty-four hour urine test was taken, results normal, and several blood panels were drawn, the results of which were normal except for mild anemia (something that's been fairly persistent for several years), and slightly raised thyroid level, an 8 I believe. I have also been previously diagnosed with GERD, tachycardia and probable IBS-C.  The side effects I noticed immediately after staring the diltiazem were  , though that's also the nature of my IBS, and  , though I often struggle with coughdue to GERD. I am managing both of those. Otherwise I've done very well on the medication. However, last week I noticed swelling and tenderness on my neck beneath my jaw, between the jaw bone and submandibular gland, which has also been swollen. It went away and now has returned again. It is less swollen in the mornings before I take the diltiazem, and seems to grow more swollen and tender as the day goes on. I was quite concerned about this but read that one of the common side effects can be swelling and tenderness in the neck. However, now I've found lymph nodes in my armpits as well that seem slightly swollen and it's freaking me out a bit. The information I read only mentioned swelling int he neck. Three months ago my GD checked my lymph nodes during a routine exam, no swelling. I saw her again two weeks ago as a follow up and hadn't noticed any swelling then either. I have a cardiologist followup in two weeks, and was going to mention the swelling at that time if it doesn't resolve itself first. However, I have to admit that after finding the nodes in my armpits, I'm a little freaked out about it and am nervous about waiting in case its something much more serious. I don't have any other symptoms to suggest I've got a cold or other infection, and I'm wondering if anyone else who takes diltiazem has experienced  generalized lymphadenopathy as a side effect? If so, has it gone away after a time or persisted? 0 likes, 7 replies "

After a few years I started developing chest pains when I exerted myself like walking up a hill or going up stairs, so I went to see my heart doctor and and he did treadmill tests other tests and found nothing so he suggested doing a heart catherization to see if I had blockages. They found about 15% blockage which he said was nothing for someone my age....but the chest pains continued and gradually got worse. I decided to get a second opinion so I went to see a heart doctor at a University Health Center that was well respected and they wanted to do another heart cath....which still found the same slight blockage but nothing serious. The chest pains continued to get gradually worse over several years...so I suspected a lung issue since I had a lung surgery when I was younger, so I went to see a pulmonary doctor and he did a   where they go into your lung and look around....it also looked fine. All this took place over 5 or 6 years. I never suspected that motoprolol might be causing the chest pains and none of the doctors ever mentioned that it might be causing my problems.

Beta-blockers - others,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/beta-blocker-bisoprolol-withdrawal-697840,Beta Blocker Bisoprolol withdrawal,"Firstly let me thank everyone for their posts in relation to this topic. I found hope and strength from so many. I am a bisoprolol user of 5 years. 2.5mg given to me for ectopic beats by cardiac consultant who was reviewing me after a hospital admission with query panic attack/heart attack. Tests revealed nothing other than ectopics. I told her at the time i had a low heart rate anyway but she persisted. When i arrived at A and E having   the first thing they had done was give me GTN which stopped my heart completely!! Reduced my already low heart rate to zero. So i have taken these for five years during which time anxiety has persisted although ectopics were not felt as they had been. I eventually realised the trigger for my anxiety attacks was a very low heart rate below 40 which was sending my body and system into a meltdown. So i decided to wean myself off. Firstly i cut the pill in half for 30 days. No effect in first week or so then i became very fatigued and exhausted. Chest pains accompanied by high blood pressure and high heart rate when doing anything. Very intense emotional moments overwhelming me. Feelings of fear and panic. Trembling was also evident. I relied heavily on CBD oil and just OTC   at this point to help which they really did. I also took vitamin c d and a b complex daily and manuka honey. I also made a carrot and banana smoothie with spirulina daily.  Rest is essential and a belief that you have to maintain that things will get better. I persisted with walking around the house and just trying to do anything no matter how small just to stay a little active although fatigue would follow quickly. At twenty five days or so i could feel that there was some relief and the bad days receded slightly. I reduced the dose further at thirty days and took a quarter off the half tablet. After two days i had a couple of really bad days where all the bad effects returned with vengeance. Then a couple of good days where i really started to feel some strength return. At thirty days i also started supplementing with L Carnitine and CQ10 and am still doing so. This good days bad days pattern has become the norm and now i am at day 57. Still have unpleasant combinations of effects on bad days but they are getting less and that is a fact. I have been able to reintroduce walking outside into my days now and other day to day activities and do feel stronger. However i have to be careful with not pushing too far too quick as i have had issues after doing this. I have found that eating smaller meals helps. Avoiding any high sodium intake helps. Water certainly helps so stay hydrated. I have learned to give in to the fatigue when it comes so just accept you have to rest. It will improve eventually. I am still taking just over a quarter of my tablet but am gently weaning off this and plan to do so over the next six months. I can say i feel much improved since doing this and even though i still have these withdrawal symptoms they are nowhere near as bad as i felt when i was on the full dose. The ectopics did return briefly but now they are not present. Anyway hope this helps someone in the same way some others helped me. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Abscess - Non-dental,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/10-yrs-living-with-fistula-any-suggestions--670871,"10 yrs living with fistula,, any suggestions?","Hey, 10 yrs ago, found a perianal abscess, didn't bother me for 2 yrs. finally became inflamed and had it drained in ER. Since then I had another 4 surgeries over two years, whenever the wound would close up. The 4 surgeries ended up with 2 drains each and 2 packed wound each. The last packed wound dressing left me with a tiny hole on the side of my cheek that would drain a minimal amount per day, not even noticeable which I was very happy with. I lived with that for the next 5 yrs and in the last 6 months my hell has come back with a vengeance. The tiny hole closed up and a week later I was in ER. In huge amount of pain, I was just consenting to anything including a seton procedure carried out by a general surgeon. She explained but it didn't hit home until I got home the next day. The pain was almost unbearable, the rubber seton was large, kept slipping in and out , which meant the knots on the seton adjustment part kept going inside me and I'd have to pull it out through out the day. I went back to work 2 weeks later but could hardly walk, just limped everywhere, 6 weeks after seton placement for follow up I was referred to a colorectal surgeon who works at my local hospital. Very unfortunate circumstances, where I was crying in pain and lying on the reception chairs, he was very apprehensive as he wasn't the surgeon who carried out the seton and all the seton procedures he's done have been very successful with no pain. So he booked me in for surgery to check it out and change the seton. The new seton was like a fishing wire and tight, that was on 2nd of May. The surgeon said the first surgery had caused a few fissures. I couldn't walk at all after that, I was completely bed ridden, I used an old skateboard from the garage with a cushion on it to get to the toilet on my knees. On the tramadol and was in so much pain all day, first time I saw the dark side in my life. I have no other medical issues all my life, so massive shock and still so traumatised from the pain experience. I managed to wait 4 weeks thinking it will get better but eventually was back into surgeries on 25th May to take the seton out as I was very unwell. Lost over 10 kgs since the first surgery in the end of March unable to eat from the pain endured, I was able to walk to the toilet after 2/3 weeks after he took it out. Went back to work reduced hours mid July. Two weeks on to current I'm now able to do some house tasks and some grading but still having problems with wound management. My fissures have almost gone, not painful anymore but itchy after BM if I ate the wrong foods the day before. Still some internal rectum discomfort which I'm assuming is from the hole they have made from my rectum wall and fistula. The other issue is the faeces coming out of my wound after every BM, this is a tiny amount however very distressing. My next appointment with surgeon is in December, to give the rectum time to heal. Then he wants to put another seton in which I have refused and want to look at other options. He suggested a flap. And that's where I'm up to , stressing about a flap and how much more pain can I endure. Don't know much about the flap apart from pain and may not be much gain.   0 likes, 0 replies "

Abscess - Non-dental,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/anyone-managing-anal-fistula-without-surgery-avoided-surgery-607177,Anyone managing anal fistula without surgery / avoided surgery,"  Just wondering, is there anyone managing anal fistula without the surgery intervention? I've been diagnosed with low transphincteric fistula almost 5 years ago (I'm 45, active male, I swim, play basketball, cycle, etc). It's been ups and downs but never too bad, always manageable, it's is more inconvenience and discomfort with only some slight pain (I've been helped with it few times by Dermatologist).  After the visit to the Colorectal consultant / surgeon (hospital appointment) back in December last year (approx 8 months ago). I've been told that the fistula track have formed the solid walls (its like the tube / pipe / channel) and, because it has formed, fistula might stay as it is now (won't get better but might be worse - no one knows).  For the past good 6 months it was very quiet and didn't caused problems (only slight occasional puss, no blood, no irritation) apart squeezing out something left / trapped after almost each bowel movement, as the skin at the external opening of the fistula tends to close (after washing out the area gently squeezing / massaging the fistula's ""tube"" towards external opening). It is only a bit painful if something is getting trapped in this ""tube"" after emptying the bowels until it can been squeezed out. At the previously mentioned visit to see Colorectal consultant / surgeon I've signed a form to try to ""fix"" the anal fistula - to go for the surgery (not cutting, but scrapping the walls of the fistula and inserting collagen gel / glue or inserting a Seton if the abcess is found),   thinking it might be good to have it done as a prevention ( in case it gets worse, despite not having problems / no pain with it now and managing with it reasonably well). After the long 8 months my scheduled appointment for the surgery is very soon now, but I'm very anxious that it is the right choice (is it worth doing the surgery when there are not a big issue (only as prevention), also, I'm self employed, started job at new place couple of months ago - don't want to risk to be unable to work / do the job properly because of the pain (involves a lot of sitting almost all the day (calligraphy, graphic design), need to come back to work approx a week / 10 days after the procedure, scared not be able to provide for the family (3 kids) not be able to go for activities in the park with my youngest kid, get anxious and depressed). Because of all these circumstances I'm really anxious and I still contemplating to call off or delay / ask to move to the later time the operation (unless it gets painful). Just wondering, is there anyone who's ""successfuly"" (if it can be said about this condition) dealing with anal fistula without the surgery. Only thoughts that I don't want to have it cleaned / squeezed after each trip to the bathroom keeps me on the side of the surgery, everything else tells me not to have it / do not rush. Is it ok to leave it untreated surgically unless it's painful. Your thoughts, experiences and advice would be telling appreciated. Many thanks! 1 like, 23 replies "
Abscess - Non-dental,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/continuous-perianal-abscess-with-testicle-pain-and-sciatica-666789,Continuous perianal abscess with testicle pain and  sciatica,"The past year in the first week of February I had my first flare up with a perianal abscess. It was drained, I went back to work after a day of rest, and did well until the beginning of May. I’ve now been out of work since and probably have had five days I can actually half way function like a normal person in that time. The second flare up swelled up and looked like as if I had something similar to elephantiasis between my legs and in my scrotum. I then received a surgical procedure to drain it with a 8cm deep hole cut between my legs. After this procedure I had frequent drops in my blood pressure, dizziness, near fainting, flu like symptoms (stomach and congestion wise), as well as sciatic and testicle pain.  A couple of days after the first wound healed it came right back.  I was given a CT scan and nothing showed up. The next couple of days the extreme swelling came back. I returned to visit the surgeon and he said the abscess was back. The “bog” in my testicles (that’s what the surgeon called it), looked as if someone had put a fishing weight in my scrotum and it hung down about an inch past my testicles right in the middle. I then had my third surgical procedure. I’m currently healed to the point the depth of my surgical wound has about closed. Yesterday it swelled some and a horrible smell came from it. I woke up today and the swelling is gone. I’ve experienced the same flu like symptoms I did the time prior the past three days. The sciatic pain re occurred yesterday and has progressed into such I may barely walk today, along with extreme pain in my left testicle. The current surgeon has referred me to a colorectal specialist whom advised she couldn’t perform another procedure to “take a look inside “ at the time due to the high possibility of it causing further complications. I’m having several test done throughout the rest of the month and no one has any idea what’s causing these perianal abscesses. I would also like to note the surgeon that performed the second two procedures stated there was no track connecting this to my anus. I post in hopes of being able to talk to someone who’s had very similar experiences, as I can find no one that’s had these symptoms alongside perianal abscesses.  0 likes, 0 replies "

Last November i had a huge abscess in the perinanal region ,it one of the most painful experiences of my life . This developed into a fistula that was relatively high and passed through quite a large preportion of the sphincter muscle so my consultant couldn't perform a fistulotomy and instead inserted a drainage seton . It really hindered my life and what made it worse was that I couldn't find many success stories online that it would even get better (just hundreds of people saying how long they have had the condition for and it wasn't improving) I am very active and like to excersise every day but with the seton it was very tricky indeed (but not impossible) anyway I promised myself that as soon as I was fixed I would post on this board and here I am ! After the drainage seton was removed it was replaced with a Cutting seton which cut through within 7 days and voila ! It was fixed . The whole process took 9 months and it was a long drawn out affair but I'm pleased I am out the other side ! Anyway I just wanted to share to give people hope that it is quite common for it all to be ok and time and a good consultant is all that it takes  Kind Regards Rossyboy1  0 likes, 7 replies "

I had an external abscess around Christmas time which my doctor prescribed a course of antibiotics rather than drain it. The abscess popped after 3 days and I assumed I was on the mend. However the abscess bursting has caused an anal fistula. Since the new year I have been to the doctors 8 times, spent 8 days in hospital had and MRI and finally day surgery 3 weeks ago. The surgeon took out 2/3 of the fistula but could not take out the rest due to it's position within the muscle and fear of incontinence. Completely understandable. he placed a cutting seton in (I think that's what it's called) but this came out 5 days after surgery. I called the hospital and they said to wait for my appointment 2 weeks later (today). My surgeon says the seton shouldn't have come out already as there's no way it could have worked so quickly. He's also not sure why it came out. I did barely anything for the first week after my surgery so there;s no way I caused it to come out. Anyway, I'm back on the waiting list to have it all done again. No idea when that will be though so quite frustrating. What I'd like is some advice from anyone if they are able to offer it. My life has been pretty much put on hold all year and I've not done most of the things I normally would. What advice do you have for living with a fistula? Should I change my diet? Can I drink alcohol? (haven't touched a drop since Christmas just in case), How much can/should I do physically? My sex drive and confidence are out of the window since all this has happened. With the leaking from the fistula and having to wear pads, I've also lost my dignity. I'm really down in the dumps and could do with some help. I'm a 38 year old male business owner. I'm usually very outgoing, socially and work wise. I usually love meeting new people and doing all sorts of things but now I spend my days working from my bedroom.

Operation booked for tomorrow ,"On Aug 20 of this year I had a hemmerhoidectomy, which was incredibly painful and left me with a few complications. I developed an infection during the recovery for it (2 weeks in) and was given a weeks worth of  , which seemed to take care of it. About a month into the recovery, I noticed a new kind of pain developing several hours after having bowel movements in the morning. It was a sharp stinging right at the top of my rectum. On inspection, I had a very small white dot right on the top left corner of my butt hole that looked just like a face pimple that was ready to pop. It was small enough that to the touch, you couldn't even feel the bump, I had to see it in a mirror to realize. With some pressure applied around it, it popped and released a bit of puss. Doing that completely relieved me of the pain for a couple days until I noticed it fill up again until it was popped. This basically has repeated for about a month. Every 2 days or so, I need to pop it and then I feel great until it swells up again. I went back to the surgeon who did my 1st operation, who did an office exam and ordered a   with contrast. A fistula didn't show up on it, but she did see the dot and suspected at least a perianal  . I was then booked for what will essentially be exploratory surgery tomorrow at 4pm. Depending on the location and what they find, I may wake up with a seton or a laid open fistula. I think that just because of how close this is to the hole and how high up it is, that they will likely need to do a seton. My big fears going into it are like many others. I worry about losing continence from cutting sphincter muscle mainly. Going back into that operation room after my ordeal with the hemorrhoid surgery is also a worst nightmare come true. I'll update this again when I come too tomorrow and figure out what's been done to me but in the meantime, any pro tips on fistula surgery are very welcome.

Mentally, it has been the hardest thing I've dealt with in my life. I'm a 22 year old healthy Male so it has been hard to cope. Anyways, the surgery was performed at a swedish hospital by a very experienced colorectal surgeon and a fellow general surgeon specializing in crs. My fistula was very low and only absessed twice before I decided on surgery. The wound wasn't very deep and a fistulotomy was performed. The fistula had another very small tract without an external opening. The wound healed fast, maybe too fast as much of the external wound was healed on about 3 or so weeks after the CRS applied silver nitrate and acknowledged that it was healing a little too fast. He said this took care of it. Fast forward to week 12 and everything is healed except the innermost portion that can only be seen by spreading in the mirror. My drainage is very very small at this point and is only dots on tissue if I shove some up in that area to check. The dots are clear for the most part. I'm worried and wonder if the tiny amount of drainage is normal or persistence/reoccurrence. I also worry when I feel the external scar because it feels sort of cord like but doesn't swell up or have external opening. At week 9 my surgeon said I was ""healed"" although I know the most internal part is still healing. (Hopefully). I'm having another appointment in three weeks to ensure that I'm not experiencing reoccurrence. Does anyone have any experience with fistulotomy and or re occurrence? 1 like, 0 replies "

At the time I was too anxious to go to a doctor. It had always felt big but I realised its my perineum which is hard and a bit big as well as my anus. I feel like it has gotten worser these past couple of months when it really started to worry me. Whenever I pass a stool this big lump/bulge comes out of my anus and I have to push it back in. It looks slightly red/purple as well as the surrounding areas and looks about 2cm long.. I have never had any pain nor bleeding but I really feel like the bulge comes from the perineum and then goes inside the anus, my perineum looks like its bulged a bit and is slightly brown/yellow then before the perineum there are two weird brown long lines of skin if that makes sense? They kind of look like skin tags and are about 1cm long coming down just before the perineum. I have quite a bit of gas as well as my stomach growling a lot. I'm mostly scared if its cancerous in any way. I sometimes have shortness of breath, fatigue and tiredness as well if that could be anything to do with it or it could just be my low iron. I would have gone to a doctor but I am on holiday right now and they don't have any available doctors appointments over here. I have a 21 hour flight next week and will be going to the doctors as soon as I get back but I really don't want to be so stressed the whole time wondering whether it is cancerous or not.

After that I went to see a doctor and they said it was a Hematoma and maybe soft tissue damage. I then got the MRI they told me I should get and I see some weird things I'm not sure of. From my knowledge a Hematoma is breaking of blood vessels then causing blood to pool up. But if you look at the image that is vertical you can see like a indent with a little circle object or something. Also I don't know if the two splits in the muscle below the circle object is supposed to be filled with that white stuff. In the other pictures you can see right above my knee a black part in the muscle (circled in blue), which that is the location of the numbness in my leg by the way, wonder what that is too. Also the MRI results from the doctor was just a Hematoma in the leg which is clear in the MRI but I just have a feeling he/she didn't fully look through my MRI. I maybe wrong and just wanting it to be more than it is but also I have had this numbness in my leg for almost a month now (27 days). Previous Post:  0 likes, 0 replies "

Accidents and Injuries,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/humerus-fracture-mid-shaft-6-weeks-in-640853,Humerus Fracture Mid-shaft - 6 weeks in,"Hello everyone. Glad to find this forum and to read about everyone’s experiences. I have found it hard to find information or pages for people going through a humerus break so I thought I would post my experiences so far.  I am a 28 year old female in Scotland. I have a mid shaft humerus fracture of my left (non-dominant) arm, which happened on 16th January 2018, so six weeks ago today. I have never broken a bone before, and I had no idea at the time what I had let myself in for. I was very much of the understanding that broken bones take around 6 weeks to heal, give or take. So apparently I chose the wrong bone to break!  I will include a brief overview of my journey so far. Please feel free to leave any comments, questions or insights    Day of injury: I fell from a horse while jumping, at speed, directly onto my left arm and knew instantly it was broken. I stayed calm and told my instructor and fellow riders in an almost jovial manner that I needed help as I had broken something. At this point I had no idea how bad it was. I asked them to call my husband also and explain I may be home a little late. Luckily my husband insisted on coming along to the hospital, as I had told him not to worry and that I would just see him when I got home... Ambulance was called, I was given gas & air and morphine for the pain (I didn’t feel any pain at this point but the paramedic assured me that adrenaline and shock were involved in that and that I’d be glad to have the drugs in my system shortly). I was taken to A&E, and examined. X-ray confirmed a broken left humerus midshaft, but no nerve damage suspected. The fracture was severe on the X-ray so I was informed that an operation was likely to be required. My arm was then manipulated into the correct position and put in a splint, from shoulder to elbow. I did require the morphine and gas&air at this point! A further X-ray was completed which now showed my humerus in an acceptable position and I was therefore told no surgery required for the time being. I was sent home with strong painkillers and told to return a week later.  Week 1 check up: X-ray showed that my humerus was now in a less favourable position than the week previous. They decided to try a brace for a week and see how it was looking. The brace was applied and the X-ray repeated, showing an acceptable position again. Sent home for a week. Having now done my own research, I believe the movement in my humerus over week one was due to having not been advised to stay upright at all times and to not rest my elbow. I had been sleeping on my side (on non-injured arm) and had often been resting my elbow on surfaces to give my neck a break from the weight of my arm.  Once I exited the hospital I felt very down for the first time, realising how long the road ahead may be. I cried for the first time today. It really hit home.  Week 2 check up: Still happy with position of humerus. Told to begin some basic movement to try and stop elbow from seizing up too much. Asked to return the following week. Week 3 check up: Position of humerus still acceptable. Different doctor this time. Doctor unsure whether callus was starting to show or whether just the angle of my injury on x-ray but seemed positive that all was going to plan. Asked to to return two weeks later to ensure position of humerus still acceptable. Told to start doing some shoulder movement also to prevent stiffness here. Week 5 check up: Another new doctor. Doctor looked at my arm for first time today. Until this point no one had actually looked at it since the brace was fitted. He said from images on X-ray it was hard to tell if any healing had begun as until calcium present the X-ray won’t show it. But he felt the bone and also asked me to try and move my arm away from my body, and he seemed to think that the arm is beginning to now move as one unit, which he tells me is a good indication that healing has started. I have now been asked to return for my next check at the 8 week mark, when he hopes to have more concrete evidence of healing. He said by now the bone should be more stable in position and that the brace is more for comfort and support at this stage, therefore does not need to be too tight now.  I am keeping everything crossed that the next X-ray will show some progress. Mentally I feel like I am coping well considering, but I miss riding and running, and driving. I would also like to get back to work but the doctor has signed me off until my next appointment. I have had some dark days where I have felt like there is no light at the end of the tunnel. I’ve had days where I have felt very isolated having no freedom to drive anywhere, and as I live in a rural area my friends are not nearby to jus pop in. I am not a talker when I am struggling so my friends had not realised how difficult things were for me. However one day I was particularly upset when one of my friends called, and she then realised how difficult a time I am having. She has been very supportive since and has taken me out a few times to cheer me up/distract me.  Sleeping has been challenging. After I read that I should be keeping upright, I started sleeping propped up with pillows. The doctor has said to me that this is not necessary however I feel that it is worth a shot if it can help. I have however now I am passed the five week point began sleeping a lot less upright, almost flat on my back. I am hopeful that the bone has enough ‘sticky stuff’ to keep it in place now. This has helped me sleep as my main issue is neck pain, with the weight of my arm hanging on it constantly, so being able to lie with the weight off my neck really has helped a bit. I have been very fortunate that I have not to date experienced much pain in my actual arm. Discomfort at times, but not pain as such. I am unsure whether this is normal?  The only other thing I’d like to mention is that I cannot yet fully straighten my arm at my elbow however from reading others journeys I believe this is fairly normal and is something I will need to work hard on to fix.  Sorry for the long post - I’ve struggled to find information around this other than on this forum and a couple of other pages, so I am hoping that my experience so far may be of interest to anyone else going through this now or in the future, and of course I would be interested to hear anyone else stories or inputs!  Sam xx 1 like, 29 replies "

Accidents and Injuries,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/fractured-greater-trochanter-anyone-have-experience--692716,Fractured Greater Trochanter...anyone have experience?,"Hi everyone!! I'm kind of at a loss here so I wanted to see if anyone else out there had experience with a fracture greater trochanter. I can't even find much online about it. I've had hip pain for about 2 and a half years now. Slowly it got gradually worse until I couldn't live with it anymore. My GP diagnosed bursitis and told me to take advil for a straight 2 weeks to nip the inflammation in the bud and the idea was it wouldn't come back. Obviously that didn't work. In the mean time I was also seeing a chiropractor who attempted to help with ultrasound, stim machine, and hot and cold therapy. None of that was helping so she ordered an xray and a MRI. Xray showed nothing in the hip and the MRI showed bursitis, bone edema, tendinitis and other general complications. She wrote me a script for PT and I did that for almost 3 months. I also received a cortizone shot for the bursitis. My PT really thought I had a labrum problem and impingement. She highly recommended that I see an ortho and the therapy wasn't working completely. It did help a little bit. So I saw an ortho and he told me I just need to rest it. After insisting a lot that the labrum needed to be looked at, he ordered an MRI with a dye injection to get a clearer picture. Finally, that MRI showed that I had a fractured greater trochanter. There was also a fissure in the labrum and my glute minimus is 90% torn at the footprint. The ortho's response to this MRI was to order 2 months of rest. I used a cane and crutches when I could and I had a handicap parking sticker. I have a desk job for work and my coworkers helped make sure I didn't get up a lot. I stopped all physical therapy at his direction. I just had my follow up with the ortho after this 2 months and I feel like there has been very little improvement. I have a lot of pain in the front of the leg and a weird twitching in the muscle. The bursitis seems to have gotten better but I still do not walk correctly. Sitting a lot seems to aggravate the front of the leg more (but I was supposed to rest it right?!) I also have limited range of motion. His response was ""don't worry about range of motion"" ""it can take up to a year to heal"" ""we will see how it is in another 2 months"" ""use the cane and crutches as needed"". And every single question I asked him his response was ""I don't know"". I asked what the future was for the 90% torn glute minimus and he said he didn't know, ""it could become chronic"". What I'd like to know from you guys is if anyone else here has had this fracture before and what treatment was given to you? I can't believe that I've had this problem for so long and a doctor continues to tell me to rest it and the only answer I'm given to questions is ""I don't know"". Any help would be much appreciated, thank you! 0 likes, 1 reply "

The phsyio had started me on exercises last week to strengthen my shoulders as the neck exercises hadn't really done anything. Yesterday, I fell forward off a theatre stage (I am into amdram) and went 'splat' straight down onto my front.  In the last split second before I hit the floor, I remember thinking that my chin was going to hit the floor first, and possibly damage my mouth, teeth and jaw (I already had a bad jaw from a fall many years ago) so I somehow pulled my head up slightly and managed to avoid that (not sure what it did to my bad neck, though).  Yesterday, the effect didn't seem too bad, though had aching thighs, upper arms, painful knees (I already have   in both knees), pain in right ankle and my upper back and upper left arm were painful as well as a painful knock on my elbow bone. Today, my lower back (on both sides) is very heavy and painful, and everything aches and aches.  I have arthritis in my right hip and back anyway, and don't know what this accident has done to me.  I didn't get any medical attention as we are in the middle of a theatre production and couldn't spare the time, to be honest.  Today, I have had to do more rehearsals for the show next weekend, and found it really difficult to stay on my feet as I was aching so much so had to keep sitting down.

About two months ago I fell off a small step and caught myself with my right hand. This resulted in me spraining my elbow quite badly but that subsided after a month or so.  I didn't feel any real pain in my hand until a couple of weeks later, I went to a doctor they performed some exams, asked me about the fall and advised that I may have a Scaphoid fracture.  I thought this was a bit absurd considering the lack of pain but I had an X-ray and it came back clear. I thought that would be the end of it but as time went on my wrist movement became more limited and the pain increase, I bought myself a wrist splint (as my doctor hadn't provided anything) and have worn it since. The doctor was still concerned about a Scaphoid fracture so referred me to a specialist.  I haven't had the appointment through yet but I am booked in for an   in a couple of weeks after which I will see a specialist. This is great and I am glad I will get it looked at, I am more and more concerned however, the pain in my wrist is pretty bad now, movement is very limited and I have alot of swelling / bruising at the base of my thumb.   I pretty much can't use my hand properly without my splint and it just seems to be getting worse.  I am perplexed that they suspected a fracture yet gave me no advise and no protection.

I figured that everyone on here would have a lot of experience with these issues... anyways... I recently (unexpectedly) started playing basketball again after about a month of being relatively inactive as I recovered from my soccer season. About a week and a half into the season (about a month ago) I developed pain on the top of my foot, about midfoot, on the more medial aspect of my foot. Every time I rise up onto my toes I can feel a deep, sharp pain. It hurts to walk (pushing off, not when my foot hits the ground), especially after practices or games where I ran a lot, and sometimes I can feel it while I am playing (other times I think the adrenaline kind of masks the pain). It doesn't really hurt that much to press on my foot, and it doesn't seem more swollen than the other foot. When I stand on my toes with all my weight on my right leg, my foot hurts the most then. It has been hurting for about a month now and shows no signs of getting better. It hurts sometimes when I am walking, and sometimes it kind of ""burns"" when I am just laying in bed or sitting down. The pain is not unbearable by any means, but sometimes is extremely uncomfortable, and I have a very high pain tolerance. So, basically what I'm wondering is if this sounds like it could be a stress fracture or what it could be instead. Thank you ahead of time for any help/insight you may have! 0 likes, 0 replies "

He told me if it didnt stop hurting they would have to do an MRi im just lost as the patient first showed me a fractured which i  included circled in the photo, but the pa seems to think because i wasnt feeling that much pain and he didnt see a fracture on other xrays that its not there.

Now my speech is becoming more and more slurred and I am shaking sometimes. When I stayed in an apartment when I first moved to hot springs I did not seem to get sick. But since moving to my brothers house and now this mobile home both I been gradually getting sicker and sicker. I think my water might be contaminated with something. At the beginning each day the water comes out white cloudy unless I run it for a few minutes. I now know I have a water softener system that not been maintained in over a year. And knowing my father he probably didn't maintain it right and  he put the wrong kind of sodium pellets in it.

At first I thought it was the laundry detergent. But no matter what laundry detergent  I tryed I always broke out red all over my skin. Now even if I take a shower I break out red all over my skin. This morning I tried running the water for 10 minutes and then drank a few glasses and now I'm feeling incredibly sick. Over my time staying here I've suffered from chronic constipation. Until about the beginning of this month. The first half of this month I drunk almost nothing but mostly bottled water. Now I can have bowl movements much easier now. One time recently I accidentally drank tap water and walked outside I felt really hot even know it was 30 to 40 degrees outside. I felt so hot that I could be outside in cold weather wearing next to nothing and still feel warm. Now I am sick in bed most the day. and after drinking any tap water here I have no appetite and I have to force myself to eat something. Also I've lost almost all ability to perspire(sweat) if anyone has any questions I will answer them to the best of my abilities if I'm still able. I used to live in texarkana but since I moved to hot springs I've been gradually getting sicker and sicker. I first moved to an apartment then to my  brothers house (which is in the village) both those places had City water. Now I live in a mobile home I rent from my dad. Where for the past 6 months I  get out at most once a month to get groceries. Whenever I go  out I notice I get better but once I go back home I get worse again. whenever I go to a place I seem to have a large craving for water and after drinking a lot of water there I always feel better but once I go back home I get sick again once I drink the water there. Now my speech is becoming more and more slurred and I am shaking sometimes. When I stayed in an apartment when I first moved to hot springs I did not seem to get sick. But since moving to my brothers house and now this mobile home both I been gradually getting sicker and sicker. I think my water might be contaminated with something. At the beginning each day the water comes out white cloudy unless I run it for a few minutes. I now know I have a water softener system that not been maintained in over a year. And knowing my father he probably didn't maintain it right and  he put the wrong kind of sodium pellets in it.

I've gotten a lot healthier over those years and was taken off of the Amlodipine and Atenolol a couple of years ago. Three weeks ago today, I saw my doctor because my BP was dropping to 85/55, my heart rate was dropping in to the upper 40's while resting, and I was feeling very ill. Dizzy, felt like I was going to pass out,   attacks. He told me to quit the Lisinopril immediately and monitor my BP so I did. My BP has leveled out at about 125/80 - 130/85  so my doctor says I definitely don't need medicine but to continue working on my health to get it below 120/80. However, the symptoms I described have not totally gone away after three weeks of being off the drug. In fact last week I ended up in the emergency room because I thought I was having a heart issue but it turned out to be a giant anxiety attack. I've had two ECG's done which show no problem with my heart (my heart rate will still drop in to the upper 50's on occasion, typically in the mid afternoon), I don't have any ear/  but I still get quite dizzy and anxious. When I'm walking, the world feels like it's bouncing under my feet. That's probably the best way I can describe it. The ER prescribed hydroxyzine pamoate for the   and anxiety but all that did was knock me out and feel extra groggy when I woke up. I saw my doctor again yesterday who prescribed Ativan for the anxiety which does help get rid of these symptoms but obviously it's not something I can take all the time. Everything I've read indicates that Lisinopril is out of your system in a few days and the effects of it are gone in 1 - 2 weeks. I'm wondering if that's accurate since I'm still experiencing these symptoms, although to a slightly lesser degree, after 3 weeks. 0 likes, 20 replies "

The only med I have been on since the dry mouth started was on that I am still on.... is isinopril. I talked to my doctor a week ago, and he suggested I cut my dosage from 20mg to 10.  I did him one better...I stopped taking tit all together (I am monitoring my blood pressure every day). In lieu of taking the med, I started exercise and diet programs (I lost forty pounds in the last six months) At any rate, it has been a week since I quite taking the pill. I figured by now I would see a change. I have it seems the dry mouth is getting WORSE. Some folks tell me that it will be a few weeks before the dry mouth goes away, and in the interim, it could get worse before it gets better. This is what seems to be happening.

Acne,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/roaccutane-ruined-my-life-103826,Roaccutane ruined my life,"Whilst I realise the good that this drug does a lot of people (including myself as it cleared up my acne permanently), I feel like I should share the negative side effects of this drug, as the impact it has had on me has been really quite severe. I am now 32 and was prescribed Roaccutane at the age of 18, just before leaving home and going to university. At the time I didn't realise it was the drugs, but they gradually caused me to withdraw from everyone and everything due to the effects it had on me both physically and therefore mentally. To start with, it caused external skin issues such as dry skin, eczema, sweating and blushing - I used to be so confident but would suddenly blush when spoken to, for no apparent reason, which often caused me to literally run away in panic. This blushing issue became worse and worse, so I then grew extremely anxious that it would happen all the time, which of course it therefore did. I avoided people and became shy and introverted during what should have been the most exciting time of my life so far. It also caused me to break out in a severe heat rash whenever I went out in the sun, to the extent that I began to hide myself away in my room with my curtains closed whilst everyone else went out to the fields to enjoy the day and socialise - I normally would have loved to be involved in this, as I was sociable and fun to be around, but instead I became lonely, miserable and probably ""weird"" in the eyes of everyone else. After just one term of uni, I had stopped going to lectures and was thrown off my course. I decided to start a new course the following academic year (telling my parents that teaching wasn't for me, so I'd try a Business degree instead), but I found immediately that I still couldn't attend lectures and was therefore thrown off that course too. I was terrified to tell my parents, because I knew they'd be so disappointed, so I lied to them continually which caused my   to soar. I spent most of my time in my room on my own. I would sleep all day long, go out every night with the few friends I had left, I was drinking a great deal, and I was so insecure and lacking an ounce of confidence that I became promiscuous. I got myself into a load of debt with credit cards, since they were practically thrown at students back then, and basically wasted almost two years of my life on a downward spiral. The physical symptoms worsened and continued for years after I'd stopped taking the meds, and I have absolutely no doubt at all that they triggered the bouts of severe   that I consequently experienced (I've attempted suicide three times in the past) and also my seemingly never-ending anxiety. Until I took Roaccutane, I was a joyful, confident, fun, life-loving girl. Although I thankfully no longer experience the blushing, the sweating, the heat rashes or the eczema, I still have to apply lip balm every half an hour otherwise my lips dry out completely - if I were ever to go anywhere without it, I'd probably have a meltdown! Overall, the Roaccutane did what it was supposed to do - it cleared up my acne - but if I could turn the clock back and never take the stuff, I would. I seriously believe that if I hadn't taken it, my life would have turned out very, very differently - and most definitely for the better.   5 likes, 17 replies "

Acne destroys the beauty of a person`s face and when it is removed permanent spots most of the time finds its home in your face which is very hard to remove. Teens and Pre-Teens mostly have acnes but adults also face this sometimes. CAUSES OF ACNE? Due to dirt or waste chemicals human skin produces an oily liquid called sebum which carries dead skin cells follicles to the surface of your skin. Follicles connect the oil glands under your skin to the pores of the skin. When follicles get blocked then the oil under your skin starts to store for which pimples or acnes starts to grow on your face. Another reason is the hormonal changes that occurs to the teens which comes with puberty. As the body starts to grow mature and develop more oil sebum starts to store for which the pores become clogged. Most of the time permanent spots remain in your face even if acne is removed or destroyed.

(I need advice) I’ve never had any huge breakouts for most of my life. Always had clear skin. Until I met someone and decided to go on to the implant, which I was using for probably 1-2 months, I hated the implant and had it removed as fast as they allowed me to. They tell us that the hormones leave your body, but I’m not sure if they have? Or if the implant (implanon) has caused permanent damage.  I have been vegan/vegetarian for over a year, but recently in August 2017 I gradually went gluten free and unfortunately I wasn’t watching what I was eating for a few months. Gluten free products are processed, packed with tonnes of sugar and unhealthy fats which can cause   which can eventually lead/trigger  leaky-gut-syndrome thus leading to acne (your body begging to be healed) I had already been causing my gut damage from being raised eating grains and dairy for years, thank god for books and articles! I also meditate a lot and raise my vibration emotionally/spiritually so my body physically cannot eat low vibrational foods such as junk food, processed meats, dairy products, dairy free products, soy, soy lecithins, soya beans, tea, coffee, chocolate ( a part from one chunk of raw dark chocolate without soy/soy lecithins), biscuits or cheap poorly manufactured foods, phytates, etc. Grains have changed – they are not what they used to be. Wheat (heavily modified), barley, maize, rice, oats all contain proteins and other dodgy things that are extremely irritant for the gut wall and gut bacteria. - My source here:  / So back to the acne and sex situation... For months me and my boyfriend were staying up late sometimes 1-3 am sometimes 4-5am because he had work until late (massage therapist) We were eating Red Thai curry with rice (GRAINS, SUGAR, FAT, GRR) without realising the damage this was doing. Bad habits... fun at the time. We once had an indian with dairy in :O I had serious cramping it was not healthy. I hadn’t been exfoliating or using any products consistently either - but I am now.  My routine is actually working for me and my skin is starting to clear slightly. I use a washcloth in the mornings with water, then I cleanse using only water. (I might step up to a chemical exfoliant eventually)  I exfoliate with the washcloth in the evenings too, and then cleanse using biodermas gentle cleansing gel then wash it off thoroughly, splashing my face 8-10 times with water. I splash my face with water to keep some moisture on my face and use a humectant before applying a moisturiser. Plus some good quality sun screen. (these tips I learnt from olena beley on youtube) - source -  / I keep a food diary... I know my good and bad days. I've started working out 5 times a week. (cardio, yoga, walks) I stick to time-restricted eating. Which everyone should do!! This is where you are supposed to eat in a 8-12 hour gap. Your liver has a circadian rhythm too! Not just the brain...( also learnt from olena beley)  I do not eat anything processed any more, I eat fresh vegetables and fruit religiously! Around 5-7 a day of vegetables. I try to eat a small amount of fruit because fructose is still sugar (inflammatory) and I use lots of herbs and spices. Maca, hemp, linseed etc in breakfast smoothie. Healthy fats only.  I currently take   probiotics to help balance out bad bacteria in my gut (saccromyces boulardii) with vitamin D, zinc, vitamin C ( all I can afford right now but I plan to take all of the below) However, everyone who suffers with acne is deficient in:  Magnesium (even non-acne sufferers) Vitamin D Vitamin C Iron Zinc Glutathione (antioxidant) L-glutamine NCA So the main worry and anxiety I have is the acne and sex correlation. My partner and I have a age gap relationship which makes me think that his gut bacteria, which can be found in his digestive tract (saliva) is contaminating me whenever we are kissing, as he is older he's had a lot more time to eat junk and not take care of his gut flora... and I feel like i'm the one suffering, especially long tongue kissing... Also, when we have oral sex I get a yeast infection or just generally itchy down there. We also sometimes have sex 2 times a day or it can even be 3-4 times a day if we have time. This isn't everyday. The days we are apart my acne starts to heal (I don't know if i'm imagining it) But we have sex lots during the week because we are quite horny for each other. ...and he also has stubble (which is irritating to my skin and stimulates oil production, clogging the pores) he is being respectful and not kissing me too roughly any more and avoiding getting saliva on my face/grabbing my face during sex. But sometimes I  feel sore around my chin after a long session of making out and love making ( it feels so unavoidable   ) He is so understanding and listens to me and we have been cooking healthy food when I stay over (which is 3-4 times week) he is making an effort. He used to be super healthy and on a raw food diet but before he was with me due to circumstances he developed bad/lazy eating habits. Also to prove  : he has athletes foot.  So, my main questions are: Is there  evidence to prove the relationship between lots of sex and acne outbreaks? Why isn't this a largely spoken about topic? Also who has used: Clindamycin Phosphate? I'd like to know other people's experiences Are my hormones going crazy because of all the sex?  Should I take a break from sex and see if my acne goes away? The thing that makes me worry is that he would lose interest or it would kill the spark if we can't even kiss because it's causing breakouts. He loves shoving his tongue down my throat ... often. Ha ha! Has anyone else experienced a problem with sex and acne? Hormonal acne that just doesn't go away? Implant removal acne?  Please help! 0 likes, 3 replies "

I then decided to see a dermatologist and she classified my acne as being ""superficial"" with a few cystic pimples as well. My acne is all over my face and has really made me hate being in my own skin. Nothing I have tried has worked. I have done the sulfur wash,tretinion, and she just upped my tretinion and gave me a antibiotic cream as well as recommended tanning. Is there anything else I can do?

My situation is getting me down. Basically I've taken Dianette for the past 14 years. I went on it due to oily skin and acne which it was absolutely brilliant for. Anyway, I had to stop taking it 3 months ago. Within a month my skin was getting oilier with few small spots. Now I'm at a stage where my skin is so oily my face will start to shine within minutes of cleansing it. I'm endlessly having to blot my face all day. My hair gets greasy much faster than it used to.  My chest and back are now spotty, and my face in addition to being extremely oily is covered in spots. My chin is by far the worst with big, red, cystic acne. Is there any hope that this will settle down in time or was the pill just masking my problem this whole time? More than the acne for me the worst part is my greasy skin. I can't go on to an alternative OCP at the moment. I'm using benzoylperoxide gel but it'snlt as effective as I'd hoped. I know there are many worse problem to have than something so superficial but its so damaging to confidence. I'm 30 and never imagined I'd have bad acne at this age. I can't even cover it up because my skin is so oily it just causes make up to slide off. Does anyone have any experience with this and any tips on possible treatments?

So after trying all the things people commented under my post,  I tried the Genuine Health Advanced Gut Health Probiotic Womens UTI 50 Billion CFU ... I took that for about a month and it worked a little bit but overtime my boyfriend and I had sex it would come back. So I got fed up and went to the doctors again, this time because I took those probiotics I thought maybe I fixed my PH a little bit so maybe the Flagyl will do something this time around, so he prescribed that along with a yeast medicine since Flagyl takes all the good/bad bacteria causing it to give you yeast. So I took that and yes for a little bit it went away and same thing came back but not as strong when my boyfriend and I had sex. So randomly I saw a post on Instagram about random detoxes and there was one that caught my eye and it's called The Morning Detox Tea and I swear to you when  I drank it and my boyfriend and I had sex, nothing happened. Usually I smell the BV during sex and it gets intense the next day, but neither happened. I drink it every other day or if I have sex, I'll make sure I drink it the very next morning. The morning detox tea includes: 1 cup of warm water 2 tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar 2 tbsp Lemon Juice 1 tbsp Raw Honey 1 tsp cinnamon The taste isn't horrible and you don't have to chug it down... I usually sip on it and I try to make sure I don't over do the cinnamon cause that's probably the only annoying part of it. That's the only thing I'm doing and usually after my period is when the BV  comes back strong and  my period will finish on Wednesday so this will be the first time I'll be drinking this after my period and I'll let you guys know how it goes!

It was 1 billion active cultures each pill. I kept taking the pill orally everyday. Some days I would take like 6 pills. IT STILL WASNT WORKING ENOUGH FOR ME ! I COULD STILL SMELL THE FISHY SMELL LINGERING SO I THOUGHT WELL HOW ABOUT THIS! I took  I dumped the powder into the empty douche container carefully  and then I added lukewarm/cold water  . I kept swirling it around to activate the cultures. I sat on the toilet and squirted all those little buggers in there. I held in the liquid as long as I could(3-5 mins) with my vaginal muscles and pinching my lips around the nozzle so the liquid wouldnt just all fall out as soon as being in there. I did this for  and one day after having sex with my boyfriend we noticed the smell was completely gone   ! I havent had a smell or any watery discharge in a week so far and I am so happy my last attempt worked!  I would still take some orally just to kind of work the insides of the body even more plus its good for your immune system. Another thing I think helped a lot is   I hate water but my body health was way more important !  This is all I did and now I am BV free. I now also drink lots of fruit juices now.   not the ones with just sugar and corn starch. Ladies try it and  see how it goes.  16 likes, 177 replies "

I've tried literally everything on this planet from antibiotics to hydrogen peroxide to tea tree to garlic to lemon to coconut oil to vinegar to yoghurt.. still nothing. So I did some research and I found a woman on YouTube who said salt water bath is the cure. I tried it but it didn't really work for me but I can say it soothed THE OUTSIDE of my vagina. But of course the problem is internal. So I figured I'd use salt water tampon.  Salt works by drying out the bacteria by drawing out the water from their cell membranes, causing dehydration.  Hence killing it. This may help destroy the BV biofilm that attaches to the vaginal wall by drying it out, causing it to no longer survive. I figured that's what it would do.  So I got a small cup and poured around 100ml of water and added one heaped teaspoon of sea salt ( has to be sea salt ) then I mixed it together. Then added a tampon inside n left it to soak in the solution for 30 mins. Then I insert it and leave it in for about 2- 3 hours repeating twice a day. I'm currently on the 4th day and so far the discharge and odour has decreased drastically. The itch has gone!!! I'm going to do this for another 3 days then I'll follow up with canesten vaginal probiotics and I'll update you    I'm also taking vitamin D3 tablets 400 I.U per tablet. Twice a day!  So far I'm impressed with the results but this is the only thing that has worked for me and actually shown results. Different things work for different people. 2 likes, 28 replies "

I know this usually happens in older people, and I'm only 19, but I have kind of had a life-long battle with acid reflux. I had it as a baby and was treated for it, but I also know I had it for a long time throughout my childhood and teenage years without treatment. I kind of thought my reflux was normal and forgot about it. That is, until 9 months ago when I developed a strong, loud, hacking couch that never stopped. At least 10-15 times a day I would have bad coughing fits where I coughed up a weird bitter substance. It has become a real nuisance to my friends at my dorm and a really painful experience for me. it soon got so bad I couldn't even sleep without waking up coughing and wheezing (not due to my ashtma, though). I have started throwing up in my mouth quite a bit and even when I drink water I have acid reflux symptoms. I am finally on some better medicine that is helping but I am really afraid that my acid reflux might have already done it's damage. It has changed my voice (it sounds much huskier now) and I cough and wheeze all the time. I knew the coughing had to do with reflux because it only started after breakfast. I guess my question is, should I be worried about BE and ask my doctor if I should be tested for it? If so, how should I present the question? I am afraid he might just brush it off as a silly fear, but I don't want to overlook something important like that. 0 likes, 6 replies "

Last week those symptoms returned with a vengeance and would not go away,so after scouring the Internet I decided to try a mixture of Diglycerinated liquorice,slippery elm,and a digestive enzyme bought from a local health shop and hey presto it seems to be working and for three days I have stopped taking Lansoprazole completely. I hope that this new course continues to work as I am not sure about the long-term effects of taking PPI's it seems to be open to debate as to their efficacy over a long period of time. Anyway for now I feel human again and will continue with my current treatment of 2-3 DGL capsules,a steeped brew twice per day of slippery elm powder(mix with milk and hot water) and one Digestive enzyme capsule at tea time. However if necessary I may still take the odd Lansoprazole if this new method fails to continue to do its job. By the way I am 63,male and currently awaiting a second knee replacement,medically retired in June last year from Royal Mail due to knee injury incurred on duty,I believe as a result of this inactivity (I have not worked since last June) this illness i.e Barretts et al appeared,the worry and inability to walk properly for 15 months has caused it to surface. I would be interested to know if anyone else has had a similar experience and whether or not anyone is using natural remedies for treating this horrible affliction which according to one nurse in Orthopaedics when I had my preop for knee replacement 'is nothing much' I quipped back that try telling me that at two in the morning when I'm still awake feeling like I've eaten a five course meal and cannot get comfortable in bed,anyway food for thought,I will be glad to hear of anyone else's experiences on the subject of Barretts and on alternative treatment.

I was on this site a lot prior to my operation and did promise I would update people on my experience, I have however been extremely busy due to personal circumstances, but finally here goes;  I had my operation at the end of October 2015, when I woke from the anesthesia I was in a lot of pain with my left shoulder, and being so drowsy I wondered if I had been given the wrong operation, however I was then dosed up with morphine and told it was normal, I later found out this pain was because of a nerve that runs from your digestive system to your left shoulder, for the following week I had this pain on and off, I'm not going to lie it was not pleasant. Recovery in the hospital was a little longer than expected, I belive this was due to the fact that I was told by nurses to try and eat soup only a few hours after the op, and was being given several different tablets to swallow, this meant I actually kept being sick, aggravating the operation recovery, once they put me on IV pain relief and stopped suggesting I ate, I started to feel better.  Once home, my recovery was much better, the first week, understandably was the worse, lots of tenderness, lack of appetite and very lethargic, but this soon improved.  After three weeks I was eating solid foods again, albeit not large amount or anything like bread/biscuits!  And unfortunately food was just running back out of me. (not pleasant I know)  Since the operation, I have not had the slightest bit of indigestion/heartburn, I am on no medication and can eat just about anything.  My one downside from the operation is that my IBS is definitely worse than it was before, and as much as I hate this, I feel it's a small price to pay to help prevent the Barratts I was diagnosed with back in January 2015.  If anyone wants to know more details about my experience etc, I'm happy to answer people's questions more directly, if they think it will help them in making a decision on surgery, as I certainly struggled before but I can safely say 5 months in I don't regret it!

In another three months, I had a cryoablation.  The GI doctor thought he might have to do two procedures but luckily the first one removed all the Barrett's. I've had two endoscopies with biopsies at three month intervals since then and both have shown no Barrett's and no cancer.   I'm now scheduled for followups every six months.

I was in the ER twice where they did a chest X-ray and then did a CT scan of the chest and abdomen yesterday and everything showed up normal.  Would the cat scan with contrast be able to show if I had a tear or rupture?  The best way to describe is like breathing through a big straw.  And my cough sounds like a drum.

Meanwhile my consultant has instructed I raise my dose of lansoprazole to 60MG  and take it all at one time. I had previously been taking 45mg split into two doses daily. I started feeling sick and had diahrroea almost immediately and have had a blistery rash every now and again. i am wondering if this dose is just too high and if there is an alternative medication. the doc has done blood and stool sample tests this week , and i have no results as yet , but i have had a rubbish time over christmas with these problems. THE doctors are not all that knowledgable and say to stick with what the consultant says. they think that the large dose has surpressed the acid so much that its possible normal gut bacteria have been able to get a bit of a hold. what does anyone think? should i stick this out till next scope? have almost decided to get the hernia repair op.

It was painful enough to bring me to the ER where they tried and failed to insert a word catheter. OB was called and the doctor said they usually like these to just resolve on their own. She sent me home with antibiotics, but nothing for pain. The pain after the squeezing and laceration from the catheter insertion attempt was unbearable and made the abscess worse. Finally after 4 days it popped on its own, but i still owe the hospital $800 after insurance. Now, 2 months later, the abscess is back with a vengance! I noticed it on tuesday when I was taking a bath. It was the size of a marble and painless. By Wednesday it had grown twice in size and was red and painful. Now it is Saturday, it is the size of a large egg, and i havent been able to get out of bed without experiencing nearly unbearable pain. Ive tried plenty of home remedies such as epsom salt baths 4-5 times a day, tea tree oil, and soaking with whitch hazel, but nothing is working!

My father has had it for a few years, but was diagnosed later in life and my aunt had esophageal   that she detected very late in stages and passed from complications (not from cancer so i'm told) - so it's clear there is some history there. I think what I'm hoping most for, is to just connect with others and hear success stories that this is something totally livable with and not putting a cap on my life years. I've googled and of course, everything comes up mentioning Cancer - which is terrifying. Additionally, I've read some things from others my own age about how they're coming to terms with potentially leaving their children and spouses behind, which is even more painful to read. My doctor mentioned my size is very small and there is no dysplasia - which sounds positive. I was prescribed a dosage of PPI's and have been researching diet lifestyles. More or less, I'm just hoping to hear that I have many, many years ahead of me and I can go on to live life as long and normally as any other person without Barrett's.

After nearly three years of suffering from these horrible, nasty, painful monsters, I finally found a cure. I had my first abcsess at 25, it was excrutiating pain and went to the size of a tennis ball. I tried all the advice on the internet (sitz baths, hot compresses etc), none of these worked and I eventually had the marsupilaziton surgery (which for some people, is a permanent cure). It was uncomfortable and I was in hospital for around 10 days. My second one came up around 6 months later, again extremely painful. I was admitted into hospital for surgery again but fortunately, it decided to burst itself in the night whilst in the hospital. I was discharged the next morning and was pain free. A few months later, another one decides to pay a visit. So as usual, I go to hospital, which by this time, the gynae doctors are familiar with me. The doctor examines me and says it is not as big as the first two and that if I want, I can have it drained there and then. Obviously, this would mean that I would be awake throughout the procedure but also that it will be a quick fix and can go home the same day. I choose to have this and with a bit of numbing cream and squeezing of my moms hand, the abcsess is drained.  This procedure is painful, but NO WHERE NEAR AS PAINFUL AS HAVING THE  ! When you are desperate, you will do anything to make it go! A year and a half passes by (present time) and my 4th one arrives. I went to the hospital within hours of feeling that familiar pain. it was not as large as it had been but I wanted to nip it in the bud asap before it got to that size and that horrendous level. The doctors turned me away twice over two days and said that they cannot do anything as it still isnt big enough to operate on.  Absolutely distressed, in pain and physically drained, I went home, where me and my mom frantically googled other peoples home remedy ideas, desperate to find a cure. We kept coming across a remedy involving,tumeric powder, coconut oil, baking soda and sea salt. First, I mixed tumeric powder with the cocunut oil, to make a paste. This bought all the puss to the surface of the abscess, making it almost triple in size and the skin layer very thin, almost ready to pop. i left it on for approxamatley 2 hours. it does get very painful and uncomfortable but u can see that it it is ready to burst. A few painkiller kept the pain tolerable. Once it looks ike it is about to burst, mix the baking soda and salt in some water and dab on with a coton pad. I left the cotton pad there, held in pace with my underwear and sanitary towel.  Baking soda and salt are supposed to burn the skin. So when the skin is very thin, it shouldnt take much for it to tare which will lead to the abcess draining. i left the cotton pad in place for twenty minutes and realised the pain of the abscess jad dissappeared. When I checked, it had burst! the pain relief is instant and you feel almost back to normal. I am now writing this less than 12 hours later and I feel great. There is very little pain (only to touch) and hardly any swelling. The abscess is draining itself. I have been having warm baths to keep the area clean and speed up draining but overall Im feeling happy and relieved. Please try this as it really does work! Be patient and brave no matter how hard it gets, and believe me, I know it gets hard! If u think about it, this is a logical remedy- the tumeric (an anti-oxidant) makes all the puss come to the surface, making the skin thin and the baking soda and salt (an acidic formula)  burns the thin layer of skin making a hole for the abscesss to drain.

I have had a Bartholin Cyst about 5-6 times now and im only 19 and i cannot even begin to tell you how painful they are. After suffering so much i can now tell you how i got mine away within a day.. i feel your pain and ive got you. On friday the 26th of October 2018 i noticed i had a lump on the left side of my vagina and it was starting to get painful. I went to A&E and was given Flucloxacillin 500mg Tablets witch i always get, after coming home from A&E i went for a hot bath and that eased the pain, i wasnt in that much pain but it was very uncomfy. I went to sleep and woken up.. The next day, Saturday the 27th of October.. today i woke up and i was in much more pain than i was yesterday but still slightly bareable, the odd occasion it was really sore.. researched so much to find a way to get rid of the cyst as quicky as possible i then came across ORGANIC ALOE VERA GEL MAXIMUM STRENGTH BY DR. ORGANIC so i got my fiancé to go and pick that up for me, its from HOLLAND & BARRETT FOR £5.99. so I went for a hot bath (as hot as i could sit in) and put a £1 sponge from B&M bargins to keep it really warm and not painful then came out of the bath and rubbed the stuff on the cyst. When applying it can give you a slight pain but it goes away in about 5 minutes. I left it on for about 1/2 hours then went for a bath again (as hot as i could sit in) stayed in there for 10/15 minutes then came out and put that gel on again, within 1 minute of putting it on the cyst had burst open and was coming out with puss and was INSTANT RELEIF.. INSTANT. I know how sore these are, they can be agony.

Bartholin's Cyst,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/marsupialization-two-weeks-ago-hole-has-healed-over--683701,Marsupialization two weeks ago. Hole has healed over.,"I had an emergency marsupialization procedure performed under general anesthestic on a labial absess two weeks ago. Really similar to a Bartholin's gland cyst marsup only the doctors didn't think it was that as the actual gland wasn't inflamed but I did develop a huge absess after having a cyst there on and off for years and got it drained twice.  I understand the procedure has been pretty identical. The lump and now the scar is deep on the inside of my outer labia, you cant see it without pulling the outer labia aside. Anyway, I got marsupialization, it's been very painful and gauze was left packed in the cyst cavity by mistake by the hospital, it was removed 5 days after the surgery and after that the pain was much less and I finally started to feel like i was healing and could even sit down again.  I've been on a week of co-amoxiclav extended to two weeks after they realised the gauze was left in and preventing healing. But now the hole has completely healed over. The stitches haven't desolved in the 7-10 days as I was told they would and are just coming out of the scar tissue and are painful. Perhaps they are pulling and creating pain I'm not sure. My question is has my wound healed incorrectly? Should the wound have healed with an open hole in to the cyst cavity forever? Or is this what is meant to have happened? The cyst feels like it could be coming back. If it was just meant to heal closed I don't understand how this is any different to just it incised and drained. Except the extreme pain and a night in hospital. Any insight into how people's Bartholin's marsupialization wounds have healed or anyone in the know would be hugely helpful.

There are four things I think you should do: Change your lifestyle if you currently dont drink enough water, water helps to flush things out of your system, keep the bad stuff from building up....water is so important.  I wasnt drinking enough water back then. Silica spray.  There is only one that has worked for me.  I must have tried 7 different types.  It is in a blue box with orange on it.  30ml oral spray, 30ml silicon dioxide x6 it is made in Australia.  I cant mention the brand as I have tried in the past and my post gets deleted.  They dont realise how this is life changing.  If you cant find with those clues I have provided please private message me like many lovely ladies have.  What I do is spray the cyst directly.  I often use one bottle for that cyst.  It either goes down or opens 3-7days.  I spray it everytime I use the bathroom.  You know you have sprayed it directly if it tingles.   Sex...dont have sex if you are dry.  I use olive oil if I am dry.  Remember what you put on your skin, you absorb.   I have found having a bath with Manuka oil really helps...but silica spray is number one.  Manuka oil is to memory 30 times better than tea tree oil.  It is hard to source.  You could private message me and I can give you a website where you can buy.  If you look for flora organics in new zealand, it says only ships to its own country due to government rules but they can ship at your risk.  My two sisters from this site (one in US, the other in Germany) both recieved and really rate it.  One applyed the manuka oil direct to cyst and said went down.  Because of what I have been doing always work I havent tried applying the oil directly but next time I will...see if it goes away sooner.  When buying anything manuka best to buy from a New Zealand website as there are heaps of fakes around the world because it is in such big demand. Anyway sisters.... I am sure if you are reading this...you are probably having a rough day.  Some of you unable to move.  Hurting.  Some of you quite depressed.  Some of you crying.  Give the silica a try.  Hospital only does a quick fix...it isnt a long term solution.  Find your natural medicine....it might be through more exersise or getting a less stressful job.  In the past I had a theory that it was my weakest point and it would let me know when I was under to much pressure. Sending you all a big hug.  Give it some time.  Tomorrow is coming.  lots of love to my sisters out there xxxx    2 likes, 25 replies "

I used to read these posts for guidance and so I did not feel alone-thank you. A small lump started on the left side of my vagina about 3 years ago and a short while later I got a bartholin  .  The first was naturally the worst.  Sharp, intense pain that would not give for hours.  I was resisting going to the ER but the thing was huge and would not burst on it's own in the bath.  Luckily a merciful NP at the urgent care down the street treated me that night (I was sent away on subsequent returns and I never tried the ER).  The relief was instant, I was hopping around for joy, the smell was awful and they gave me an antibiotic shot in my butt.  😃  I got these abscesses about every 2 months after that.  I got with an excellent MD gyno in Tucson who excised a few but insisted it would resolve on its own.  She was very difficult to get appointments with especially since abscess grows and bursts in like 4-5 days.  I only took   one other time.  Sometimes the lymph nodes around the area would be swollen.  I started just letting them burst on their own.  I knew I could work until the day it burst (I could tell by the size / pain).  Then I would rotate between bed and hot bath.  I tried tea tree oil, epsom salts, castor oil, onion slices, vitamins but nothing worked.  The pain was not as bad after the, I don't know, 10th one.  I got used to the pain and also the cyst would burst quicker / easier now that there was an established drainage hole.  My gyno gave me some hydrocodones but they don't work when it's the day to burst!  BUT if you've got the time and someone to help bring you things you can totally get away with lying super still in bed and it will just burst without much pain.  The pain comes from moving around.  The pain goes away after lying down for a about a half hour. I moved to another city and my new gyno did a marsupilization right away.  I was in the OR, took about 2 hours to get home and I have been free of the cysts since!  The healing was not bad at all compared to the cysts and I was able to work after a week.  I still take baths a few times a week and I keep it clean. Good luck to you and definitely get with a doctor if you can since these have a high chance of reoccurring without professional excision. 1 like, 1 reply "
Bartholin's Cyst,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/home-remedy-for-bartholin-cyst-that-works--570177,Home Remedy for Bartholin Cyst that WORKS! ,"I'm 24 and starting getting bartholin cysts just over a year ago. It has recurred at least 6 or 7 times, and I have had an Incision and Drainage performed twice, one under local anesthetic and once under general. I can't stress enough, GET THE GENERAL! The needle with the anesthetic was BEYOND painful, and I'm not ashamed to admit I screamed bloody murder when they cut the thing open! Hands down, the most painful experience of my life. With the general, I experienced zero pain and no memory of the procedure. Yesterday, to my horror I felt the familiar hardened bump start to rise. Today at work, where I sit at a desk all day, the pain went from tolerably uncomfortable to unbearable. After being driven to the ER and speaking with a doctor, I decided to forgo the surgery, or at least postpone it, and give home remedies one last try. In my searches through forums and websites, I saw the same remedy mentioned a few times: Phoebe's Cure. I decided I had nothing to lose, drove to the pharmacy, and picked up the necessary ingredients: a bottle of calamine lotion, a bottle of witch hazel, a bottle of tea tree oil, and a roll of gauze. At this point, it was about 5:00 in the afternoon. I drove home, drew myself a hot bath and added Epson salts, and sat for about 20 minutes. When I got out, I soaked the gauze in a mixture of 6 oz of calamine lotion, 2 teaspoons of witch hazel, and 2 teaspoons of tea tree oil. The recipe actually only asks for 1 teaspoon of the latter two ingredients, but at that point I was almost hysterical with pain so I figured, go big or go home. I soaked the gauze in the mixture, then covered the cyst (likely an   at this point) with the gauze, held in place with my underwear. I left this for about 40 minutes, swapped for a hot compress for about 10 minutes, then applied another soaked gauze for about 30 minutes. At this point, I couldn't even help crying from the pain. I took a painkiller, and drew myself another hot bath, this time using table salt instead of Epson salts. I stayed in again for about 20 minutes, then restarted the cycle of changing the soaked gauze every 30 minutes or so. I could feel the cyst growing in size and getting even harder, and I noticed the mixture in the gauze was causing some stinging. At around 9:00, about 3 and a half hours after I drew the first bath, (WARNING, this is gross! Please do not read past this point if you are squeamish!) I was lying on the couch and suddenly felt liquid drip down. I put some mild pressure on the gauze, then went to the bathroom to see what was going on. Full disclosure, I'm also on my period right now, making it extremely difficult for me to tell exactly what was going on. I pulled the gauze away and sure enough there was a large spot of pus about as big as a Canadian Twoonie. I wanted to cry in relief, but didn't let myself believe I was out of the woods yet. I swapped for a new gauze again, left it, checked again, and sure enough, more pus. I put pressure on the spot where it seemed to be originating from with the gauze, and when I pulled it away, more pus. I cried with absolute relief.  I have never, ever found a home remedy that was even remotely effective for this ailment or any other. I am BLOWN AWAY at how effective this was! Let me preface this by saying I'm not a medical professional by any means, but I believe this worked by bringing the pus to the surface of the abscess until it finally burst. The originating spot of the pus was the spot that had become the hardest and probably the most painful point on the abscess over the three and a half hours of changing gauzes.  If you experience painful bartholin cysts or abscesses, PLEASE give this a try! Absolutely worth it!  5 likes, 112 replies "

Bartholin's Cyst,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/suffering-with-recurrent-periclitoral-649134,Suffering with recurrent periclitoral,"Hi there,  I'm looking for any advice & sharing of similar experiences (ESPECIALLY if you suffer/have suffered with a cyst in the same area). Here's my situation:  In summer last year a noticed a pea shaped red bump beside my clitoris on the right-side of my labia minora. Over the course of a few days it grew to the size of a tangerine - was red, swollen and extremely painful. Doctor sent me straight to ER, they drained it under GA. A month later it recurred, they marsupirlized under GA.  It was diagnosed as a peri-clitoral cyst which I am told is very rare. Then I had nothing (though a tiny unnoticable symptomless cyst remained under skin) for months until Christmas when it became inflamed/swollen/infected again. Amazingly I managed to stay out of hospital this time by being religious with sitz baths, using a homemade ointment of castor oil, tea tree and witch hazel and doing hot compresses.  A month later of course it returned again and despite keeping up these methods, it continued getting more swollen and very painful to the point where I had to return to hospital. They drained again, this time we me under local anaesthetic - which I don't recommend to anyone - the needle is very painful. After the 4th recurrence my gynaecology clinic finally took the matter seriously and advised surgery for the excision of the cyst when it's not inflamed. They warned of potential tissue and nerve damage given the area it's in... but I didn't see any other option. From the two drainages and marsupilization I already have scar tissue anyway and am so tired of the disruption and pain, trauma etc.  So I'm booked in to the OR.. I wake up ""post-surgery"" and the surgeon says she couldn't find the cyst. She was confused because she had felt it herself two weeks previous, and I too had checked and felt it the night before. (Just to reiterate, when it's not infected, it's a tiny and visibly unnoticable little bump). But it had in fact disappeared & no surgery could be done because they didnt want to cut me open if they couldn't feel anything (which makes sense).  I was discharged & not given a follow up appointment or anything. This was about 3 weeks ago. On Tuesday night I felt a bruising feeling and of course, the cyst was starting to swell again. I'm sitting here now with it gradually getting more swollen & am also getting waves of   (which I've experienced before with this - I guess it's the infection?). It's not unbearable though, just uncomfortable at the minute. Keeping up with the usual epsom salts sitz baths, my ointment, hot compresses...  I went to see the gyno who tried to do the surgery this morning. She gave me a Doctors note and told me to show it to the gynos in ER if it got to the point again where I needed to go to hospital for drainage/marsup. The note requests excision surgery under general anaesthetic. This concerned me because she had previously told me she would not under any circumstances perform the exicision if the cyst was swollen/infected, because the surface area is expanded and it's hard to tell the actual perimeter of the cyst meaning there are wider margins for damage.  What are my options here? Is there such a thing as a vaginal cyst specialist? How do I see one?! Finding doctors and gynaecologists I've experienced so far to be less than accommodating. I understand that the area the cyst exists in is rare and thus they are unsure how to proceed - but the element of 'care' has been less than desirable for this whole experience.  I'm in Canada by the way - Toronto specifically.  Thanks in advance ladies   0 likes, 3 replies "

Anyways, i'm hoping it heals nicely and that i have no more reoccurrences – fingers crossed. Furthermore i was told by my surgeon that Marsupilation is meant to be the best procedure – whether others agree would be interesting to know… Secondly i have to say that although I think this website is useful to share information I guess as a new suffer myself it would have been nice to see more positive feedback and success stories because after reading all the comments I was quite horrified at the reoccurrences and left doubting whether I should have left well alone as opposed to having surgical treatment!!

Bartholin's Cyst,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-bartholin-cyst-experience-abscess-and-cathedar-271485,My Bartholin Cyst Experience - Abscess and Cathedar,"I had my first in January and I had never even heard of this before! At first I thought I'd had an in-grown hair or some such thing and within days I obviously knew it was something frightful. I thought my labia looked like the elephant man's disease! I could feel a lump the size of a marble and was very scared. My doctor suggested I do the sitz baths with eposom salts and that, and I did every so many hours. I work from home and I'd sit in the tub with my laptop propped up on the toilet several times a day. Nothing worked.On New Years day I was in so much pain I went to Emergency and had it lanced.   the exam is very quick, because it is very obvious. It's more embarrasing than anything. The part that can really hurt is when they give you the local anaethetic - its a very small needle and a very small amount, but they must prick you in several places there and it smarts. But honestly to me - no more than poking it with a fingernail, really. Still, both times I've had this done it helped to ask the nurse if I could hold her hand. It only took about oh, one or two minutes honestly.   the doctor will make an incision - but weirdly, because you are numb, you will be more freaked out by ""feeling it"", but there really isn't any pain. It's more anxiety than anything. It doesn't hurt. What DID kind of hurt was the last time where my doctor squeezed it like a huge zit, trying to squish out all the yucky - the doc before that did not do that, but instead had the nurse flush the wound out with saline and water several times before the cathedar insertion. It was not painful really, just super uncompfortable - like someone squeezing on a bruise you alaready have. Very annoying!  This takes like 3 minutes maybe - I didn't feel him actually putting it in. Both times though, they said they had to cut me a little bit more again which made me very anxious. They have to make the cut big enough to intert it. When they cut you DO NOT MOVE around if you can help it. It's natural to freak out, but just pretend you are at the dentist - the less you move, the more accurate they are. Again - not painful, just freaky so just relax as best you can. I personally tense up my upper body and hold the nurse's hand and relax my lower half. The whole procedure is done in 10-15 minutes.  You will feel IMMEDIATE relief. Yes, it's invasive, yes, it's unplesant, but I have never thought 'oh gosh, I regret this' at all afterward (physically anyway). The Aftermath: the first time I was told to keep the cathedar in for ten days. The second time I was told to keep it in for 4-6 weeks! It is generally advised to keep it in for a month. The first one I had fell out in 3 days. The balloon and the inscision was too large I guess and it drained and fell out very quickly. My doc said I'd likely have a recurrance and he was right. Here I am 6 months later and here I go again... However, this time, my doc made a smaller inscision that kept it in there. A Word Cathedar is very uncomprtable for some people - mine kept rubbing up against my clit and pee-hole (just being real, sorry!), and after a few weeks I thought I could cut it shorter.  . You might look at it and think your yuck is draining from there, but it is not. It's actually draining from your cut only. The purpose of the cathedar is to make your bartholin gland bigger - so that it may drain better - and also maybe never close up again.  If the cathedar falls out too soon, there is a good chance you have a) not drained the yuck suffiently and/or b) will get it again because your opening shunk back to size for your lovely gland that is having the problem. So it is good to have a larger gland, as uncomfortable as that stupid tube is.  This last time around - I dont know if I made a mistake or not. I did not realiize that the tube was only there to make my gland more open. I thought it was a 'drainage tube'. Make no mistake - it is not. The thing that hangs out is only a ""handle"" for the thing keeping your bartholin gland hole open to heal you. If you remove it yourself, you risk getting another one.  if it does, a doc usually will not replace it. They might decisde to give you antibiotics, but that's rare if you have a good doc beause most of them will tell you that an issue that is 'encapsulated' cannot usually be addressed with drugs. It's not directly accessed by your blood stream. Isn't that great? Lame!!! I would obviously advise you to go see a doc. Again, the earlier it comes out the more chance you have to get another cyst.  The tube that sticks out is only there to make the opening in the cut proper to heal right. Remove it too soon and you risk it closing quickly. The issue with that is that is has no drained like it should. That being said, I might have made mistake: but those who want to remove it themselves, it's actually very easy: I thought I could cut it shorter because I thought it was a drainage tube, and I was tired of it bothering me. So I took scissors and cut the tube near myself - and all of the saline immediately drained out and the balloon fell out.  The best thing to do is to squeeze out as much yuck as you can out of that opening if you wind up doing it yourself or having it fall out. Either way its best to follow up with a doc, nurse, or clinician. Last time I had a lump left over but it went away and I still had a reccurance. This time I feel no leftover lump, but that doesn't mean anything. The best treatments I had during my experience was in my baths: 4 times a day, epsom salts and tee tree oil, and with my cath was ibuprofrin and cold compress.  DO NOT by any means do a cold compress with a cyst - it will only shrink the gland instead. It is as tdll as a tear duct, maybe smaller, It will only make it worse! I only advise that for healing with a cath! Know that weirdly SO many women get this: my first one was when I was 34, and my GFs said they were in their 20s - god bless and good luck    1 like, 19 replies "

Bartholin's Cyst,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/bartholin-cyst-gland-excision-experience-positive-655750,Bartholin Cyst Gland Excision Experience - POSITIVE,"It's extremely hard to find any positive experiences of this surgery, and even the horror stories are almost slim to none. This is such a common problem and the longer I've had these cysts, the more people I've realized get them too and I'm not the only one. I hope this helps someone going through the same thing because I get it. It's AWFUL. I have had 8 Bartholin cysts, which became infected every time in the last 7 years. I am 23 now and I got my first at 16. About a year ago, I had a marsupialization as a permanent solution after several in-office lancings, catheters, etc. 3 months later, I developed another cyst and discovered that antibiotics made it drain on its own and it was gone. Got another one 3 months after that, 6 months post-op. Same treatment at home - antibiotics made it drain. 4 months after this, 10 months post-op, I got my third since my surgery. Antibiotics didn't take, so I made an appointment after about a week and they happened to have a cancellation the next day for surgery and my OB/GYN suggested I go through with the excision surgery I have been dreading because of these horror stories I have read (and cried) about for months. I had my excision 6 days ago and am feeling okay. Waking up after the surgery was terrible and I was in excruciating pain for a few hours, but I was told no morphine/pain medicine was used during the surgery, so it was warranted. I took pain medication for the first 12 hours in conjunction with 500mg ibuprofen every 6 six hours, and it mostly just uncomfortable. I did not sleep for more than 3-4 hours at a time, and slept with a pillow in between my legs for comfort, but I was able to keep up with my medicine. I used an ice pack on and off for 20 mins at a time for the first 36 hours to help with swelling. Now 6 days out, I am somewhat pain-free. And mind you, I have like, ZERO tolerance for pain. I'm the biggest baby. There was some bleeding right after the surgery, but it turned to just some discharge by the next morning, and I have had a tiny bit over the last day or so. Here and there I get a pang of slight pain or a pinching feeling that hurts, but it goes away. I am a bartender so I have to be off of work for 10-14 days and have been resting as much as I possibly can. It is mostly just uncomfortable and I can't stand for too long of a time before needing to sit/lay again. This experience is straining on my relationship (he was here for my marsupialization in the very beginning), but we both agreed that this was the right thing for me to do. I know that I can't live my life afraid of this happening forever and always wondering when it's going to come back, so I went through with the surgery. I have a check up appointment with my OB/GYN who also performed the surgery this week, a little after a week post-op. I am still taking my ibuprofen every 6 hours to manage soreness/discomfort and I have been on a week of antibiotics to prevent infection. I decided to look today after the swelling and possible bruising has gone down and was definitely surprised at the amount and placement of the stitches. My doctor said they were inside the vagina rather than outside like my marsupialization (which was terrible because I had them for 8 weeks and they hurt like hell), but they run all the way from the gland and up to the top on the right side in the inner labia. It's not pretty but I'll take a little ugliness over pain and fear for the rest of my life. All in all, I'd say this is going to be worth it so far. Happy to post updates if it helps someone else reading comments on the internet until they're crying themselves to sleep out of fear like I did. I would have loved to see A) real information that is actually helpful and B) positive experiences that made all my   and tears worth it. 0 likes, 15 replies "

I lost my indefinite award of DLA back in 2016 but wasn't awarded PIP due to only getting 4 points out of 12. I have multiple mental health conditions and I have been ill with them since the age of 16 and I am nearly 43. I don't think PIP is designed for people with mental health problems where the symptoms connected to their illness can vary both over time and in their severity. My first assessment caused me great   and I don't think I can go through it again for a second time especially as I have recently been for another benefits-related health assessment in the past month. The worst thing is receiving a report back from the DWP written by someone who has never met you and has no clue how your illness affects you from day to day.

I have severe chronic anxiety and was purchasing clonazepam  (Klonopin) illegally as my GP will never prescribe me benzodiazepines again, ever.

That is an astounding 160mg comparison per day. I detoxed cold turkey 1 year ago and I went into hell. I won't list the symptoms and horror I went through. I told my GP and he referred me to the mental health team. I am seeing a psychiatrist Monday. Do you thing I will be admitted to a mental hospital for detox. I recently turned 50 years old and have heart failure (dilated cardiomyopathy, ventricular tachycardia + other cardiac issues) I am wondering if the psychiatrist will admit me for tapering due to cardiac issues or prescribe me diazepam tapering and send me home. I have 3 tablets remaining and I am still anxious as they stopped working. I know 100% that in about a week I will enter withdrawal hell again. Some of you may say, wait and see what the psychiatrist says on Monday but I am keen to discuss this and be involved in a support group. I keep thinking how she is going to approach this as my consumption is very high and very longterm.

But the thing I'm wondering is, what would be better to take to help me sleep. Zopiclone or Amitriptyline? I am on 100mg of Sertraline and obviously one of the side affects is insomnia which I've been suffering with for over two years, I have broken sleep when I do eventually sleep and can't sleep more than two hours straight, I'm just always waking up every hour. I'm tired and just want some god damn sleep, and to be able to sleep like a normal person. Zopiclone was given to me as a one off by my doctor, she gave me 7 tablets and said she'd never give me them again after that and it was just to help me get back to sleeping properly. But I've done exactly what she told me to do previously as she gave me instructions to follow regarding a sleeping schedule; unfortunately the insomnia has not been cured and I'm still exactly the same. I've heard some people on Sertraline are also on amitriptyline as amitriptyline can be given as a sleeping aid at a low dose; which I'm thinking of trying but I just don't want it to do any harm to me or make me worse with mixing the two. (It'd be great if it could also help my   at the same time haha) Or should I take zopiclone, I know that zopiclone isn't a long term fix and I know all about how it's addictive- I've suffered with addiction before and I can control it now so I wouldn't allow myself to become addicted to zoplicone (I know people will probably say it can't be helped) but with my willpower I think I'd be able to manage it. Can someone give me advice please on what I should do or take? 0 likes, 15 replies "
Benzodiazepines and Z Drugs,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/ashton-isn-t-the-only-way--694036,Ashton isn't the only way......,"A little back story.  I have struggled off and on with drug dependency since my late 20's.  I am 39 now.  My drug of choice was Xanax.  I know the pain of withdrawl and sympathize with anyone going through it.  Recently I commented on a post looking for suggestions on using The Ashton Method for Diazepam, and I shared with the person that a 3 day Librium detox worked for me.  Under the care of my psychiatrist, who is a licensed drug and alcohol therapist, he prescribed me 6 Librium.  I took 3 the first day, 2 the second, and obviously 1 the last.  Besides a few nights with restless sleep, I was good and I have remained sober since.  I know the dangers in stopping cold turkey.  I had multiple seizures, in very public places, when I was abusing.  It's not fun.  Especially Xanax, which is the hardest of the benzo's to come off of.  One person was outraged to the point he reported me and called me irresponsible.  Let me make myself clear.  I never attempted The Ashton Method.  It probably works.  However, from the posts I have seen on here in the past few years, basically people come on this site and think there is NO other way to detox.  Well, I shared my experience because there is another way.  5 months, upwards of 10-12 MG a day, a three day Librium detox and I was ok.  I was out of the woods.  My Dr. had never even heard of Ashton.  So a message to everyone who scares people into thinking there is no other way:  STOP IT.  Some people don't have the luxury of a long slow taper.  Some people aren't trying to come off of 1 mg of Ativan a day.  Nothing against those who are, because obviously as someone who has abused this type of medication, I respect anyone who wants to live their life without it.  But there are many people like me who started off being prescribed the medication and that led to abuse.  Which led to Dr. shopping, coping drugs on the street, and all the other fun that comes with being a drug addict, be it a street drug or a legal prescription drugs.  And people like me don't have the luxury of decreasing their dose by 1-18th of a MG every six months for 5 years until they are off of it.  We are tired of being high all the time, and being sick with withdrawl if we don't have any money to cop.  We need and want help, and we want to get off of the stuff as quickly as possible.  Anyone who has ever sought help in a rehab or a detox setting knows they don't use Ashton but Librium when you're in these facilities.  I'm not sure if this site is funded by Ashton him or herself or if people just want an excuse to stay high for a few more years as they ""taper"", but what I am sure of is exactly how I said I detoxed is what worked for me.  I'm not suggesting now hitting the streets looking for Librium.  I'm just letting scared people know that they may not have to wait years to be drug free. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I do not take benzos, but wanted to be prescibed them for anxiety over the last two years. I am ok though with not having any and sticking to propranonol. Basically I have managed to get some xanax just incase of emergancies of bad anxiety attacks etc, i would only take 1, not 3 during a day and would only be a once off which i had discussed with doctors about, However i am going on holiday soon, very anxious about it, and it would be a trip with family to scatter my aunts ashes, so it would be an emotional trip. i also dont like travelling. If worse comes to worse i may take a xanax. Saying this i know that family would want a couple of drinks during the evenings when we are away. I do currently drink alcohol dilluted to relax, calm down abit etc. I was just wondering would it be harmful if i took a xanax on the day/ morning for example of going on holiday? waited a couple hours, and later in the evening drinks with family?  the dosage is low of xanax and i would only take a one off just to get me out and be able to travel? even if i had to split it in half just to make it safer would it be ok? 0 likes, 4 replies "

Benzodiazepines and Z Drugs,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/benzo-success-story-698562,Benzo Success Story,"We see alot of withdrawl posts on here and negativity towards this category of drugs as most who use and are successful do not have the need to share their stories. so I have decided to make a happier post with my time with these Drugs, namely Diazepam (Valium) So after going A&E last year with chest pains and having all the standard checks I was diagnosed with   and told to see my GP with regards to this and about August time was preacribed Sertraline/Zoloft. I don't even take paracetamol for a   and spent hours looking online and reading the horror stories surrounding them so refused to take the sertaline. I was getting worse and into a pit of oblivion, got depressed, light headed, and slowly started to become a recluse other than going Dr once/twice a week and having more Bloods taken, Chest X-ray's, ECG's, Endoscope to check larynx and pharynx, I didn't go to out, stopped working and started being teary as Christmas was rapidly approaching. I thought I was not going to be here to see my children's face at Christmas and one day my doctor literally said to me ""Tom what have you got to loose, if you start the sertraline now by Christmas hopefully you will be feeling better"" because of the horror stories I read about starting these the doctor prescribed 14 x 2mg diazepam and told me to use as and when needed as well as referred me to a psychiatrist wellbeing practitioner for CBT. I spent hours trawling through this forum and several others again full of negativity so spoke to my doctor and was told the reason is because they are highly addictive and explained that the withdrawl is worse than opiod and deadly so not to abuse and over do it. so about mid September I bit the bullet and started Sertraline 50mg alongside the diazepam for the first few days I was taking about 2mg diazepam daily and then tried bachs flower remedy because I didn't want to build a tolerance. about 3/4 weeks passed and I still wasn't feeling right and had run out of diazepam so went to see my Dr again and he discussed how the sertealine work and that side effects should be stopping but wanted to increase the dosage to 100mg sertraline daily and another 14 x 2mg diazepams I felt the 100mg a bit more and after a couple weeks the doctor gave some more diazepam and explained he didn't want me getting addicted but after averaging I had used them sparingly and he explained how if I was going in after a few days wanting more they wouldn't give the diazepam but due to the health anxiety I wouldn't do it to my self....... My doctor hates me using ""Dr Google"" and we now joke about now much I use it still to this very day. about December he increased my sertraline to 150mg and as I was having chest pains suggested I may also have costochronditis but because of the ssri advised against nsaid and use ibu gel instead externally. but this had made me more anxious so was also given some more diazepam to ease the anxiety and referred to a cardiologist to ease my mind. I am due a cardio appointment any time now but have been using diazepam as and when and use about 14 2mg a month. I am now able to get back out and spend time with my family, do household choirs, cut the grass etc things I just stopped doing. If it wasn't for these I wouldn't have even started the sertraline so for myself these have quite literally being a life saver, my family are happier and they say happy wife, happy life haha. If your Dr has prescribed them do not be like I was who read all the negativity and thoght ""oh my god"" just use sparingly and if you feel you need more or are getting addicted speak to your Dr although most doctors wont dash them out unless they can see you are not over doing it with them or using them recreationally. keep strong. 2 likes, 10 replies "

Benzodiazepines and Z Drugs,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/zopiclone-side-effects-39152,Zopiclone - Side Effects,"I was prescribed Zopiclone about four years ago as a remedy for chronic insomnia - I have Fibromyalgia and the lack of sleep was absolutely killing me.  At first I was just really, really happy to be getting 8 hours of solid sleep and woke up feeling like I could take on the world.  However, one morning I woke up as usual and opened my bedside drawer to get my daily vitamins out and I discovered several chocolate wrappings!  I couldn't remember eating any chocolate and so I asked Husband if he had put the wrappers in my drawer (even though I was pretty sure this wasn't something he would do).  Husband then told me that about an hour after I had said goodnight and left him in the lounge watching telly, I'd come back into the lounge and asked if we had any chocolate.  Seems that somewhere between getting into bed and actually falling asleep, a severe chocolate craving had overcome me!  Even more odd was the fact that Husband told me this wasn't the first time it had happened and that I had regularly gotten up after going to bed and meandered around the house, eaten chocolates, drunk tea or coffee and had lucid conversations with him.  Suffice to say I gave Husband strict instructions to hide the chocolates well and to send me back to bed should I ever get up after having said goodnight. The second strange thing that occurred after starting with Zopiclone was that I could feel my teeth, and I mean really, FEEL. MY. TEETH.  It was perhaps the most odd sensation I've ever had and together with the metallic taste (which I had been told to expect) it made eating, drinking, talking and smiling quite unbearable.  I'm not sure why I never linked the feeling the teeth thing with Zopiclone and actually pursued other avenues like gum disease and receding gums in an attempt to 'cure' myself! The third, and perhaps worst, side effect - also something I never linked to the use of Zopiclone until now, was recurrent urinary tract infections.  We had just moved (in my defence) and I honestly thought there was just 'something in the water'!  On average I would say I had a UTI every two to three weeks and they would vary in severity from mild irritation quickly remedied with Citrasoda to debilitating infections remedied only with a long course of anti-biotics.  Then about eight months ago now, I decided that I could no longer take Zopiclone, it had stopped working effectively and when my dosage was increased I was left feeling very foggy the next day and the metallic taste in my mouth was magnified and frankly, just unacceptable.  If I had half an hour sleep a night for the first four weeks, I was lucky.  To be honest I can't even tell you how I made it through but I was determined that I was not going backward and that this lack of sleep would have to kill me before I took another Zopiclone.  The good news is that within weeks my teeth returned to normal, the metallic taste was almost non-existent and I hadn't had to see the doctor about a UTI in what seemed a lifetime.     I'm curious whether anyone else has had similar side effects (extra sensitive teeth and recurring urinary tract infections) - or is it just me?! 6 likes, 49 replies "
