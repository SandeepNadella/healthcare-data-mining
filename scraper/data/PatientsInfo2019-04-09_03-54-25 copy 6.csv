Palsy - Non Cerebral,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/having-bell-palsy-612178,Having Bell Palsy,"Hello, When I was diagnosed with Bell palsy I completely fell apart. I had been stressed out for a month dealing with class, work, fulfilling the requirements of my scholarship and rehearsing for a show that I was in. I was told that it was something that can go away in a week or last for 3-6 months, and time was not in my favor. As the weeks drew on i found myself getting more and more depressed. I felt helpless and rarely found any comfort in looking at support forums. But after 2 months I found a bit of movement returning. I surrounded myself with comfort and support from friends and family, and ate healthy. Day by day i found myself regaining more and more movement and I was finally finding a light at the end of this horrid tunnel. By 3 months i was able to smile, and i found myself mostly recovered at 5 months. It was the hardest months of my entire life but I learned a lot about myself, and learned what was most important to me, and who cared for me. I'm here to say it will be a long journey but you WILL get better. You are NOT alone, and you WILL be able to smile again. I hope for the best to those of you who were recently diagnosed, and wish for a speedy recovery. I hope my words were able to offer you some comfort. Thanks  1 like, 3 replies "

A day or two before the paralysis set in I felt a burning ripping sensation on the right side of my scalp and my tongue and lips felt weird on that side and it progressed from there. I have a very high tolerance for pain but the nerve pain I felt was awful. That mostly subsided aside from touching my face up until now has hurt but not nearly as terrible and slowly gotten better. Three days ago (Monday) my right eye and the surrounding area (eyebrow, lid, and the side of the bridge of my nose) started twitching quite a bit and hard twitches. I'm now experiencing more nerve pain and today have developed a burning sensation and constant pain in my forehead above the right eye. And as the day goes on I'm experiencing   into my shoulder and back of head on right side and also had the burning sensation. As well as my scalp having that same feeling.

Palsy - Non Cerebral,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/bell-s-palsy-recovery-and-residual-effects-534631,Bell's Palsy recovery and residual effects,"Bell's Palsy is more common than people think, I suffered from it in January 2015, I woke up to a face that didn't work on the left side. After doing some   tests on myself I was confident I had Bell's Palsy. I went to hospital and was prescribed the typical treatment of  .  3 weeks later and I had full control of my face again. However I know that being able to move my face did not mean I had fully recovered. Recovery Recovery from Bell's Palsy can take months, depending on the severity of the nerve damage. My full recovery took 7 weeks (relatively fast) I know people who have taken 2 months to regain movement. After you regain movement there are a few things you can do to speed up the recovery process.  Apply a fairly warm compress to the effected side, focus on the area behind your ear and side of the face. Use gentle massage to stimulate the nerves. Reoccurring attacks are more likely during the recovery process so be sure to stay on the prescribed treatment until you have regained movement for at least 2 weeks.  Residual effects For those who have had Bell's Palsy the aftereffects can be mild to severe. In most cases the common problems that follow are twitching and localised weakness  (this may come and go) in some cases you may get synkinesis where you involuntary move one part of you face whil meaning to move another foe example, when you smile your eyebrow may move.  Some may get   towards bell's in a way that any twitching or weakness will depress and put the sufferer into a panic, calling for a doctor immediately.  Rest assured that Bell's Palsy is very common and the chance of a reoccurrence is slim, most sufferers will have to deal with Palsy once and only once however if there is going to be a  reoccurrence most will get the next attack in 5-10 years of the first. You can also experience  phantom Palsy  (not medically named) where past sufferers will cause weakness in the face due to constantly moving it to check if the illness has returned. 1 like, 40 replies "

Nearly 6 years later I am going to relay my personal long lasting effects of having the horrible paralysis. My face works! I can talk, smile, eat with my mouth closed and blink with both eyes. So my face is all good. However, I still have damaged nerves. My left eye twitches (noticeably) when it's cold or even mild. My upper lip moves and pulsates when I've been eating or chewing gum or anything that involved chewing or moving the mouth for an extended period of time. When I get stressed I can hear a nerve in my left ear pulsing right near my ear drum. Obviously I thought it might be something else so I got it looked at. Yeah it's a nerve. To top it all off I get random numb patches come and go on different parts of my face. Localised to the left side in most cases. So bell's palsy has successfully managed to destroy my facial nerve on the left and leave me with life long twitches. But will it return? Well it's been 5 years nearly 6 so here's hoping not. I have done extensive studying on this condition so if you would like to know anything just ask away. Let me know you long lasting effects if you have any. 0 likes, 13 replies "

At that time, I was able to see myself in the mirror for the first time and I didn’t recognize the person looking back at me. Being so young my head automatically started jumping to conclusions like am I going to look like this forever and if I am no one would ever like me this way. But I was wrong. The way you look shouldn’t matter when it comes to people liking you and my entire life before getting Bell’s Palsy I always thought that I wasn’t good enough. However, Bell’s Palsy isn’t permeant and if you have just been diagnosed it may seem that way but trust me it’s not. Some people recover within days and some people take months. In my case it took me a year and a half and I was left with some residual Bell’s Palsy which just means that I am not 100% what I was before but I am pretty close to it.

Crohn's Disease,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/diagnosis-uncertainty--674985,Diagnosis uncertainty.,"Hi, I had a bit of minor bleeding and loose stools over the course of a couple months and I didn't really feel like it was a good idea to ignore it. Went in to get myself checked out, and a flexible sigmoidoscopy showed a tiny patch of ulcers in the descending colon that looked just like mouth ulcers. The GI seems convinced this is Crohn's from the ulcers alone, but I'm not sure--could it really be that? It doesn't seem to hurt at all, the bleeding incident seemed to be limited to one occasion and a lot of symptoms people talk about having are just completely absent. Basically, I don't feel like I'm 'ill enough' for it to be something like that. Further fuel for my scepticism is that I've heard NSAIDs like ibuprofen can cause similar damage in the intestinal tract, and I'd been chucking back like 2-3 a day for a good few weeks before I went in for that colonoscopy.

Crohn's Disease,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-story-any-advice-appreciated--668170,My story. Any advice appreciated.,"Hi all, First, a bit of an introduction. My name is Daniel. I am a 32 yr old male, who is currently under investigation for IBD (undiagnosed). I have been reading these forums for quite a while since everything started, but feel that I need some additional support and advice going forward. Ok, where to begin... I've never really suffered from any ailments during my life so far, but on the 1st of June this year, I came home from work and noticed a burning sensation in my lower right abdomen, around my hip area. This feels like a tugging/tightness. I started to panic and get a bit anxious. I tried to take my mind off it by sitting at my computer, but all of a sudden, this massive head rush hit me - Like a feeling of being flushed. My hands and feet started sweating quite badly and I just lost it. All of this followed with weakness, extreme nausea, loss of appetite etc. I won't go into much detail about the NHS proceedings, as i'm sure most of you are aware i'd be writing a bible here, as you're thrown from pillar to post without much help, but to keep a long story short: - Eventually got sent to the surgical assessment unit on the 6th of June with suspected appendicitis. Got blood work done and also abdominal x-ray. Nothing found. Got sent home and told that it might just be a virus and to wait it out. - The following week (11th to 15th), I appeared to be making a recovery. My appetite eventually came back, I felt good, but my abdominal tightness was still present, although not causing any issue. I just assumed that it probably is viral and it would pass. - Next, everything changed again. By Saturday the 16th, I started to lose my appetite again. Next day on Sunday I felt like I was back to square 1 again. Everything came rushing back. All my symptoms. I spent the following weeks having a lot of time off work. I got weak and started losing weight. I used to sit around high 14stone, verging on 15, but I dropped to 13 1/2 in the space of 2 weeks. My diet was always VERY high fat content. Meat (red), cheese, sugar mostly. It wouldn't be unusual for me to consume more than 3000 calories a day, but my weight always stuck to the same high 14's. Now, I am struggling to maintain it. On the 29th of June, I was back at the surgical assessment again. The usual blood work got done, but nothing found again. They got in contact with a gastro doctor and asked for his opinion. When they noticed my weight loss and dehydration, they advised that I be kept in overnight. I was given 4x 500ml bags of fluid through IV and had to provide several stool samples. The next day, I was put onto a polymeric diet using Ensure Plus. What prompted them to do this is due to the fact my Calprotectin levels were raised at 130. I was then discharged and instructed to consume 8x bottles of Ensure Plus per day to meet my calorie needs, as well as resting my bowels for 6 - 8 weeks. Now, here's my problem. Since being discharged, I have been struggling to take 8 bottles of Ensure because it seems to bloat me after having just one! It honestly feels like i've just eaten an entire meal, so I attempted to become a bit more strategic and have 2 in the morning, 2 lunch, 2 dinner, 2 at night. This went well for a couple of days, until I realised I wasn't urinating for an entire day! This was pushing me back into dehydration. It's the bloating I simply can't get over. You just don't want to stomach any water after the shakes. I HAVE attempted to get help by frantically calling the dietician, who simply tells me that if I'm struggling, I could try some low fibre foods, but how am I supposed to get my required 2500 calories from that? The great thing about the Ensure Plus is that you're gaining 300 cals from one bottle, but the bloating is ruining it for me. The dietician won't offer further help as she tells me that it's the consultant who is in charge of my investigation and is the only one authorised. Ok, so I attempt to contact him, but so far, after many, many calls over various days, I can't get a hold of him. Simply told that he's 'not here' So i'm completely lost. Over the past week I have been in hospital various times for other issues. - Woke up in the morning with what seemed like a cold. Yellow/green mucous etc. No cough. Carried on my day as usual at work, came home and noticed blood when I cleared my throat. Looked in mirror and yet another surprise - yellow patches on my tongue, like little rings. I immediately got in contact with the health service, got checked out. Oral thrush. They weren't concerned about the bleeding for some reason, but there you go. So I got given Nystatin to take, which seems to be clearing it. - Next day, I go to work as usual again, but when I got home, I went for a bowel movement, only to be hit by extreme constipation. I couldn't pass the stool. I ended up soaking the toilet paper with blood. This got me going again, so I once again, got in contact and got checked out. They gave me glycerin suppositories to give me relief, as well as a physical examination. This seemed to help. The next day, I spent most of the time with severe stabbing pains in my bowels, which I can only assume is more hard stool trying to make it's way through. Went to the pharmacy after work to pick up a bottle of lactulose. Within 2 hours, I was basically passing fluid from my rear end, so definitely flushed me out. Currently, I have stopped taking the Ensure Plus shakes as I get bloating and pains by drinking them. I've had nothing to eat for 2 days now, just trying to keep drinking water. I can't get any help to change the diet or anything. What do I do? Has anyone else any experience with these shakes? My discomfort is localised in the lower right abdomen, and it can manifest itself as muscle pains going round my right hip too. Back pain isn't uncommon either. More recent stool tests have indicated Calprotectin levels of 250, up from my previous 130. I am just not sure whether I should push on with the shakes, or if I should attempt to try solid food, but low fibre. Getting really weak due to no sustenance, so hoping for some advice from people who are going through IBD etc. Although I am not diagnosed yet, I have an MRI scan on the 27th of this month coming up. I suppose this will be the start of the long investigation. Many thanks to all who read this. Sorry it's a bit long. 1 like, 23 replies "

Crohn's Disease,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/blood-tests-and-crohn-s-disease-query-679560,Blood Tests and Crohn's Disease Query,"Hi All Just after some information as to whether Crohn's Disease (CD) or Ulcerative Colitis (UC) can be seen during a routine blood test? I've done a bit of research and found that routine blood tests cannot diagnose CD or UC, but are good indicators on how severe the levels of inflammation / infection are during active flare ups, and whether medications are helping to subdue the diseases. I only ask as I was recently asked to provide a stool sample to test for faecal calprotectin, which came back positive. This is the third test I had done in the last year and the results have always been around 350. I had a follow up colonoscopy about 6 months ago, as a result of the first positive calprotectin result, however everything looked healthy and the biopsies came back fine, ruling out UC. Now my doctor suspects CD, however I had a blood test taken a few days after the faecal calprotectin test and the results of the blood test was fine, apart from slightly low vitamin D levels. This recent blood test according to the nurse was the full works, and I know included vitamin B12 and D tests, magnesium levels, liver function, kidney function, and a load more including the routine tests. I've been having digestive problems for about three years now, and had numerous blood tests in that time and the only problem ever found was slightly low vitamin D results, no other problems ever found. I'd be very grateful for any thoughts and views on this query, especially if you know whether or not active CD or UC are in fact visible on blood tests. 0 likes, 6 replies "

For about 3 weeks now I have had pains in my lower left and lower right abdomen, in my flank area.  In addition I have been having a lot of bloating, gas both internally, burping, and also flatulence.  I have also not been moving my bowels well.  It feels like the more I push the tighter my intestines get, I almost feel like the feces is not dropping from my gut to my rectum.  When I push on my lower abdomen I hear and feel gas and liquid moving around (I've never had this before) the gas moves around like trapped bubbles.  I am actually able to force burps and rectal gas out by moving my body and or pressing on certain areas of my abdomen.  As the day goes on the symptoms get worse. Last week I went to the hospital and had a CT Scan of the abdomen.  It showed  thickening of the sigmoid colon and mild pericolonic stranding- the conclusion was ""could relate to acute colitis.""  I followed up with my GI Dr (who I have not been seeing very long) he disregarded all test results and basically said he felt the results were not accurate- implying the report was written subjectively for interpretation.  He told me he believes this is just IBS.  I have had all kinds of stomach issues and, at this point, I don't even expect to feel 100% but I have NEVER had this.  I wholeheartedly feel something is wrong- something more than just IBS.  These pains to me are not normal. I don't know if this is constipation related (I am moving my bowls, just not averagely... in my opinion). Any input is much appreciated as I am at the end of my rope. 0 likes, 0 replies "

I was failing.  I’d had every test known. CT scan. Endoscopies and colonoscopes. Barium meal X-ray. All negative.   Even my appendix out as they suspected it was chronic appendicitis. All failed and the pain was just getting worse and worse. I’d been on codeine phosphate. Tramadol  etc. All Worked for a while until my tolerance grew and it came back 10 fold.  The general surgeon who removed the Appendix believed it could have been referred back pain. SO WRONG Then I changed GP who said there was one last test. Faecal cal-protecting which came back raised.  So after reading this forum. Everyone said push for pill capsule/endoscopy. Which showed. Erosions and pockets of inflammation in the small Intestine/bowel.  So she started me on. Cortiment Budesonide 9mg 6 week. 6mg 6 week and the. Continue on 3 mg permanently. Also using buscopan 10mg and Adcal-D3 calcium carbonate and vitamin D.  It’s now been 5 week. And I feel born again.  My pain as decreases so much. My back pain also. I do keep having the odd  uncontrolled bowel explosions. And also had a couple of chest infections and colds. But I’m not laying in bed constantly. As this was the only thing that eased the pain.  I feel more reborn. I was Honestly at the stage I know longer wanted to be here.  Basically don’t give up.

And to make things better I’m expecting my 2nd child New Year’s Eve.  Don’t give up hope. It takes a while. But there is not a cure.

Constipation,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/the-nhs-failed-to-put-forth-effort-to-find-the-cause-of-my-constipation-for-years-671897,The NHS failed to put forth effort to find the cause of my constipation for years,"My name is Sarah, and I'm 16 years old. From birth, I struggled to pass poo and was almost always in a lot of pain due to what was labelled as 'chronic constipation from birth'. To put into perspective how ridiculously lacking in effort to find the cause of this constipation the NHS actually was; I often went   without passing any poo besides the small blotches of overflow that I would often soil my pants with. The longest I ever went without a poo, though other times weren't too far behind, was 9 weeks. Until mid-way through my eleventh year of living a life filled with agonised straining and yo-yo'ing to and from the toilet, I was given movicol and senekot, as well as enemas on a regular basis. Two biopsies were done in the   of my life, yet everything came back negative, specifically hirschprung's disease came back as a negative. My parents and I did our own research after eleven years because it was getting out of hand, and I was being bullied for it far too often, and through our own research, we found out about the ACE stoma. We asked at my next appointment with my gastroenterologists if I could have the procedure, and they pretty much immediately said yes if they could get a surgeon to do it. It was almost as if they knew they could do it for all of my childhood (which they ruined due to negligence) but couldn't be bothered to get it arranged or even to bring it up. Anyways, June 5th 2013, I had my stoma fitted, and we were informed by the surgeon that my bowels did present as though I had hirschprung's disease but likely the biopsies weren't done high enough. Now, five years later, I'm still suffering the consequences due to the laziness of each and every nurse that failed me through my entire life. I am, admittedly, much better since I have had the stoma, but one thing they don't tell you about it is that it takes a huge mental toll on you after a while. I now hate having the stoma since I've only had to do washouts through it twice this year and all it's really good for is weeping and being inconvenient, though I've had bowel blockages every few months regardless of whether I was doing the washouts on a nightly basis or not. I wanted to share this story because this potential-misdiagnosis stripped me of any chance to have a decent childhood and has since ruined my life and confidence. Is it possible that I can sue the NHS for neglecting me for over a decade out of sheer laziness, or do I have to live the rest of my life knowing that I'll never get justice for their failures? 2 likes, 4 replies "

Constipation,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-ve-had-a-bm-once-a-week-for-around-8-months-straight-now-and-it-s-finally-caught-up-with-me--669115,I’ve had a BM once a week for around 8 months straight now and it’s finally caught up with me.,"I’m a 16 y/o male. I remember transitioning from a somewhat normal BM schedule into my current situation around November of last year. 8 months. Since then, I have a BM maybe once or, rarely, twice a week. They always hurt somewhat, and left me stuck on the toilet for 20 or 30 minutes. But that was never enough for me to do something about it.  Well I had a big realization a week or two ago that most people have BM’s every day or two which is a far cry from what I’ve been experiencing and it’s kind of woken me up on how I might be experiencing a problem.  Tonight though, was the real kicker.  I was sitting at my desk like every night, when I felt the need to use the bathroom. So I went to the bathroom, expecting a day (week?)  like any other, when suddenly the biggest BM of my life attempted to leave my body. By far the most pain I’ve experienced on the toilet. I couldn’t get anything out for a solid 30 minutes besides large chunks. It just sat there hurting me while I tried to not over strain (I’ve heard that’s bad). It also gave me a cut around my anus. Eventually I gave up, took a hot bath and drank some water. A few hours later I was able to pass it, with some pain.  Anyway, this experience has sort of made me think about my weekly movements and, frankly, I’m worried about it. My diet is bad. I’m hoping that’s the answer. I basically have only eaten pasta, red meat, and chicken with other assorted bad things for a long time. Starting tomorrow, I’m changing that.  Also, I’m not sure if this is related, but I’ve been experiencing testicle pain as well, especially the left, daily. Sometimes more so when on the toliet. I’m just worried that these may be the signs of something worse like   or something so that’s why I’m here. Does anyone know if what I’m experiencing sounds like something serious? Or is it a purely diet issue? Thanks. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I am a 15 year old female. This may be a long one but any help or advice would be well appreciated.  I will start of with bedwetting. I have been bedwetting for a long as I can remember and it is not getting any easier/better. I have been to the doctors so many times and they just say she will grow out of it. Well I am 15 and I still haven’t grown out of it. I currently wear nappies every night to bed and have to change in the middle of the night as they get so full. I don’t know what else to do - please leave any advice or tips that you have used or anything would do in my position.  I will talk about constipation next as it is kind of related. I have chronic constipation which the doctors think causes my bedwetting as my bladder can’t deal with the pressure. I went for my monthly check up in the doctors (I have these every month to check on my constipation and so it doesn’t get really bad) however I had missed last months appointment and so they hadn’t checked me out. I went about 5 days ago and explained to the doctor when they asked me if I had been regular I said no and that I hadn’t gone in 6-7 days. He went on to feel my stomach and it was like a rock - like I am badly constipated. I am now doing disimpactation and am on day 4 and far nothing has happened not a single leak or not of poo has come of me at all and I mean nothing. Normally I would have passed something on day 2 and it would just keep on coming (sorry if TMI) until I got to a watery poo, but nothing this time. I am starting to get worried - is this normal, has anyone else experienced this? Should I wear nappies for when it does happen to help with the messes?

Constipation,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-finally-found-a-solution-to-17-years-of-constipation-484771,I finally found a solution to 17 years of constipation,"This isn't a question but I just wanted to share this for anybody that it might help because it truly changed my life. I've had chronic constipation since I was 3 years old. When I was 3, I was molested, and (I was told by my doctor but I'm still not sure how the two are connected) I began holding my poop. I would only hold it for a few days when I was younger, but it became a habit, and by the time I was 10 years old, I could hold it for about 3 months. Some people say that's not physically possible, but trust me it is! My body began to work in a cycle. I would poop, then I would not poop again for 2 weeks, then I would become constipated and hold my poop in for 2 weeks, and then finally I would let one out the size of a softball. This often tore my rectum and cause hemhorroids. When I was about 15 years old, I finally began to realize how serious it was that I only pooped about once a month. So I tried to change it. But by then my body was so adapted to the cycle that nothing I did ever changed anything. I had already taken every type of stool sofener ever, and eventually even enemas stopped working for me. Constipation was literally controlling my life. I had no friends anymore because I was too uncomfortable to go out and do anything, and I often missed weeks of school at a time because I could not move or I would be in so much pain. Over my life I had been in the hospital a few times and they gave me an enema and stool softeners and discharged me. The problem always came back. I suffered with this problem all the way through my junior year of high school. I would come home at 17 years old my would be crying and searching the Internet for anything that could help me. Doctors didn't even know what to do anymore. One day, when I was 17 years old, my mom took me to the hospital because I had not pooped in about 2 months and I felt like I was dying. They gave me an x Ray and told me that I was completely impacted. No enemas or stool softener a could fix it, I was going to need surgery. I was transferred as to Neumors children's hospital as an emergency patient and placed in the icu for a surgery the next morning. Then my doctor decided that a surgery should be the last option. They gave me enemas and had me drink 2 gallons of mural ax in one night. It made me have to poop so bad but I couldn't. So here I was, a 17 year old girl in the icu on tons of pain medicine, crying and leaking poop all over the bed and floor, while my mom was in the same room. Not a pretty picture, I know. I was in so much pain and so depressed in the icu for four days before they finally did the surgery. I was put under anesthesia and when I woke up I felt great. They had manually removed all the stool from my body. I was told to take miralax twice a day and a stimulant laxative every morning. Doctors advise against taking these regularly, but in my case it was necessary. I was also put on Zoloft, for anxiety. I'm not 18 years old and I have not had any problems with constipation for almost a year. I've had this problem all my life and I honestly thought nothing would ever work for me. I thought I would never get married or have kids, I would be a virgin my whole life. But my entire life has been turned around in such an amazing way. For any moms out there desperately looking for a cure to their kid's constipation, this may not work for everybody, but it sure as hell did wonders for me. Fist you need to get ALL of the stool out so that you can completely start over. I had this done in a hospital, but you can do a simple intestinal clean out, just find one online. Then I took a cap of miralax every morning. When I got home from school, I took a stimulant laxative to give me the urge to poop. If you have done the clean out and taken the miralax, it should be almost diarrhea and it would come out easily. Continue this for a few months until your body get used to NOT holding poop anymore. And if you hold your poop, you may want to consider an antianxiety medication to relax you. The Zoloft did really help me a lot. I'm currently still taking Zoloft, but no stool softeners. And I haven't had a problem in almost a year. Sorry for all the nasty details and everything that was TMI, but it's worth it if it helps ANYBODY because nobody truly knows wheat this is like until they experience it.  10 likes, 44 replies "

Lol I’m 30 years old, I’m female, and deal with random constipation. This has been going on for about two or three years now.  I recently started going to a gastroenterologist. I also just had a colonoscopy a few weeks ago. He found one tiny polyp and confirmed I have a mild case of diverticulosis. The doctor didn’t  say much about it or tell me how to handle it. He didn’t even really act concerned about it. So fast forward, and the last least two weeks or so, I have had perfect bowel movements. We are talking, if you look at the bristol chart,  I could make a doctor proud. They are thick, smooth, and usually at least 12 inches long. They are easy to pass and predictable. I go when I wake up in the morning, around 1:00  in the afternoon, and if I’m lucky, I might even get to go again in the evening before bed.  This has been going on for a couple weeks and I have been ecstatic. Then about two days ago, I didn’t go when I woke up and I knew that was the beginning. If I don’t go when I wake up one morning, I know that I am about to go through a bout of issues. Now I’m only going a little bit here and there, very sporadic, and it’s not always easy to pass. I am feeling like I’m not completely emptying myself because I’m not, and every time I deal with this, it really affects my mental health. I can’t explain it, but when my bowels are cooperating, I feel like a whole new person. But when I constantly feel like I have stool sitting somewhere in my rectum and I know I haven’t gone like I need to, it really messes with me. The problem is, I have absolutely no idea why it changed. I have tried connecting it to everything I can think of. Last couple of years, I have cut out dairy, I have cut out wheat, I even stopped eating as many vegetables for a period because I thought maybe I was getting too much fiber.  I drink lots of water (doctor even told me to back off the water so I have), I don’t drink soda, and I only drink coffee once a day and that’s in the morning.  Even when I am not having issues, I continue to drink coffee, so I have eliminated that as culprit. I’m just at a loss.  Like any person, I do not eat healthy 100% of the time, but I definitely am far, far more aware of what I eat than probably 90% of the people I know. I Avoid processed foods, I eat whole-grain if I decide to eat grains, I eat fruits and vegetables all the time. I eat balanced. I watch my sodium. I watch the kinds of fats I’m eating. The only food I have noticed that is directly connected, is bananas. I used to eat bananas every day, but I don’t anymore. I don’t know if they are really as aggravating to my digestive system as I think they are, but I feel like my constipation was always worse when I was eating them regularly. So I’m looking for help again. There has to be a piece to this puzzle that I am missing. There is something that I am doing or eating that is causing this, because when it’s great, it’s perfect. But when I’m having issues, I’m miserable. Anyone have a similar experience? Advice? Thank you so much! 0 likes, 2 replies "

Constipation,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/constipation-and-bloody-mucus-667575,Constipation and Bloody Mucus,"Hey all  So for the last 10 days, I have been dealing with a rather rare bout of constipation. I rarely have any issues or abnormalities with bowel movements so this whole situation is rather odd. So over the last 10 days, I have been relatively regular, going every day or every other day. But the stools have been very difficult to pass and have required quite a bit of straining and are larger than normal and hard. It is almost like passing meatballs, if that makes any sense. During this time, I have experienced some pain and tearing near the opening of the anus that has lead to some minor bleeding. This shows itself as streaks of bright red blood on the stool and the paper. I have been treating it with Prep. H and it has been improving significantly. However tonight, when I used the bathroom, I passed two pieces of stool that were seemingly covered in certain parts with bloody mucus. I have never seen anything like this before. The mucus is separate from the stool, slimy, and unquestionably red. The color is a brighter red I would say, rather than dark or maroon. And even though it seemed to be on the stool ... it was not really ""mixed"" with the stool. Some time ago, my GI doctor suggested that I may have IBS and treated me with IBGard. Last month I experienced a few weeks of lower abdominal cramping and discomfort even though stools were normal. This has relatively stopped but has been replaced by this bout of constipation. I eat plenty of fiber and drink water constantly. And I saw my primary care physician just yesterday and he prescribed the antibiotic Doxycicline for a separate issue that he believes may be due to a bacterial infection not related at all to my digestive tract. Apparently a serious side effect of Doxy is bloody stools but I have only taken two doses and really doubt it is the cause. I will call my doctor's office tomorrow and see what he wants to do. So my question, for those who have experienced constipation ... can constipation and straining possibly lead to bloody mucus on/in stool? I have pictures as well. My apologies for the graphic nature of the pictures. And also my sincere thanks to anyone and everyone who takes the time to read/see all this. Cheers all! 0 likes, 7 replies "

Constipation,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/chronic-pebble-pellet-poop-683273,Chronic Pebble/Pellet Poop ,"Right around the new year of 2018, I started having pellet-like/pebble-like poop. The poop is small and round, some are thin, some are thick - all are hard and dry and are difficult to push out. I frequently feel the urge to go, push out some pellet poop when I do, and don't feel completely done with my bowel movement afterwards. I feel a strain on my rectum when I do poop. Basically, this kind of pellet poop occurs about 2-3 times a week, with no bowel movement in between, and only about once every 2 weeks do I get a real ""good"" bowel movement ie. long, thick, soft logs. Sometimes I see mucus in my pellet poop. A bit about me - I am 30. I have never had constipation (at least, not like this) until this year. I eat a ton of vegetables and fruits and whole grains, and more crucially, my diet has not changed from the past 10 years until now. Crucially, I went to see a Gastroenterologist about this in February and got a colonoscopy done. He said everything was normal - no issues. While this is relieving, it also makes things more puzzling. Does anybody have any idea what this could be? I spoke to my mother and she said when I was 7 years old, I did have one bout of very bad constipation where they did an x-ray on my bowels. The doctor mentioned something about my intestinal shape, but my mother didn't really understand and needless to say, no bowel movement issues until now. Does anybody know if this could be a thing? 0 likes, 0 replies "

My colleagues insist that I eat more than anybody else but I keep losing weight and some find it alarming. Some overweight friends tell me that if they ate the same food like I do they would not fit the door. I also find that my hunger is impossible to beat. I can eat the typical 3 big meals a day with many snacks in between which are not really low in calories. I don't consume alcohol and I don't smoke and I don't drink sugary drinks. (just not my thing) I noticed that whenever I go to the toilet I have greasy bowels one day and the next time the stool is hard as a rock. The next time it can be greasy and soft again and then hard again. Sometimes it's greasy at the beginning and then hard rock on its tail. I don't remember when I passed a normal stool the last time. With my meals I eat really big salads with no dressing. I consume plenty of water. I bought this psyllium husk (some people swear by it) and after a week I felt more constipated. At that time I drank water like crazy but it didn't help. I increased the psyllium dose and still no effect. Today I got complimented my some colleagues that I lost noticeable weight and I just said thank you to avoid any further discussion. I know I eat a lot more than the average person but constipation and weight loss are my symptoms. I am kind of worried. 0 likes, 1 reply "
Constipation,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/slow-transit-constipation-right-sided-faecal-loading-680170,Slow transit constipation & Right sided faecal loading,"Hi, Does anyone suffer with (or know someone that does?) ""Idiopathic Slow transit constipation"" and ""Right sided faecal loading"". I have suffered with constipation on and off for many many years - now in my mid 40's and suffering worse than ever. I'm currently able to poop 1 or 2 X per week. I have been given every laxative, stool softener (and so on) known to man!  They have made little to no difference.  I'm now at my wit's end. 4 days ago I had a colonoscopy - I'm still very painfully bloated from this - any gas that does come out is mucousy and still not pooped since. For several months prior to my colonoscopy my Consultant changed my diet - limited high fibre foods, no seeds as they stick to your colon walls. Basically I could eat anything that was 'low to no fibre' - this makes no sense to me as it's not a healthy diet and goes against my idea of  /living. I've been told to go back to eating normally (everything in moderation,,l) and to continue using movicol - stool softener and prucalopride to keep things moving. I hate taking medications - especially when they're making no difference. Has anyone else suffered with this? Have you been able to treat this yourself with diet alone?

Constipation,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/constipation-prolapse-rectocele-intussusception--374514,"Constipation: Prolapse, rectocele & intussusception?","Hi everyone, This is my first time posting here after browsing a little while, so I hope it’s ok that I post. I’m feeling at my wit’s end and don’t quite know what to do, so any thoughts at all would be very much appreciated. I’ll try to keep it brief, but basically I have had constipation for about 6 ½ years now. It started very suddenly (potentially after being on iron supplements) and since then I have been taking Dulcolax daily. I have been back and forth to the GP and then a GI specialist at the hospital constantly. Until I moved to a new town (about 3 yrs ago) I was just getting fobbed off, told it’s all in my head, I’m too young to have anything wrong with me, it’s my fault, or simply eat some kiwis (I kid you not!). I’m now 26, going on 27, and the past year or two I’ve had a few answers. Not one GP or specialist has made any suggestions of what’s wrong or offered to send me for tests I need, however. I have had to research, tell them what I think’s wrong and push to get tests or treatment. So, in a nutshell: -   Constipation for 6 ½ years, sudden onset. Then sudden weight lost (down to 4.5 stone), unexplained. Quick decline in energy. I’ve since put weight on and am now 7 ½ stone. No improvement in any symptoms. Feel full, uncomfortable, pain. No bowl movement at all if no laxative. Dulcolax works but others, including newer ones like Prucalopride, don’t seem to work.  On Dulcolax it can be unpredictable at times, very much liquid form usually, mucus (sorry for the grim details).. I’ve tried all dietary changes, spent a fortune on supplements and treatments, but nothing has helped. -   Frequent urination. There’s almost constant pressure on my bladder and I can wee every half an hour. Sometimes I can’t go properly, so I stand up and a minute later I need to go. Incredibly frustrating! -   Pernicious Anaemia – injection every 3 months for just over 2 years now. I also have iron deficiency anaemia but have only recently started on supplements again once a week due to my experience last time.  I also have folic deficiency. -   Amenorrhea – no periods since all of this started. I’ve had periods when on the pill but no periods at all when not on it (ie. I’ve been off the pill the last 2 years and no period). GP said I was a ‘conundrum’ and left it at that. After pushing, I’ve managed to get a gynae appointment for April. -   Hypothyroidism – I had to push for the tests, then argue them, then push for treatment. Now on Levothyroxine 50mg, upped to 75 every other day. No noticeable improvement in energy though the tingling, such as in my hands, seems to have stopped, and I’m not crying in exhaustion after work every day (though I still feel like that!) Recent tests over the last couple of months are more interesting. I did say I thought I had a prolapse all those years ago and was told ‘you’re fine, stop trying to find problems where there aren’t any’… -    Sitzmarker transit study – Did not go to the loo for the whole duration so all marks still there. Markers mixed up but most are all down the left side of the colon. Suggests possible slow transit (perhaps from all the years of laxatives? Or perhaps because I was full before the study started so they had no where to go?). -   Defacating Proctogram – I had to ask several times for this. They told me on the day in Oxford JR I had a rectocele and full rectal prolapse, but would have to look at it further to tell me any more. He said it wasn’t surprising I was constipated, in pain or having such issues with weeing. My GI specialist saw me yesterday for the results. He said it was a rectocele (I think he mentioned 2.5 something…?), rectal prolapse and intussusception grade 5. I was caught off guard yesterday as I wasn’t expecting the latter about intussusception, nor the Sitzmarker results. When he emailed me about the Sitzmarker results he had told me all of the markers were right down the bottom of the colon, which they were not! He had suggested biofeedback, which I said no to and asked for the proctogram because I thought I had a prolapse, so I’m glad I stuck to my guns on that one. He is referring me to ‘his colorectal surgeon’. I had wanted to ask to be referred to the Oxford Pelvic Floor Clinic as I’ve lost all faith in this GI and my GP but I wasn’t expecting the results I got, and not knowing much about intussusception I didn’t know what to say. GI tried numerous times to ‘sell’ me some of the latest laxatives and suppositories I could be a guinea pig for and I was nearly in tears trying to get him to understand the prolapse/rectoele etc need to be dealt with and that I don’t want any more darned pills that don’t work. I don’t know what I’m looking for. I guess I’ve spent so long trying to keep all to myself and it’s cost me a lot. I have no friends, social life, I left my relationship, and now I’m really struggling in my job (I’m an advice and support worker). I’m getting impatient. It’s been long enough but now it will be more weeks or months to see the GI’s surgeon, probably be referred to someone else as he doesn’t know anything, and so on…  I guess I’m wondering whether anyone has been to Oxford Pelvic Floor Clinic, how long you waited, or whether going private may be an option (potentially a very expensive one?). I want to think this could all be explained by the rectocele, prolapse and intussusception, and that a laparoscopic ventral rectopexy could solve the issues, followed by months of retraining my bowel due to having spent years on laxatives. Or perhaps that’s wishful thinking? I’m just so fed up, disheartened, shattered and now at a loss for where to go from here. Sorry for the long rant. If anyone manages to read it all, then I apologise. Thanks in advance if anyone does have any thoughts as they would be very much appreciated. Caz  0 likes, 18 replies "

I have up to 2 BMs per week. It took me until this year to finally realize I need to eat healthier, however I realized this a tad too late and now it's like no matter what I do I can't get normal BMs again and it does get me really down. I've only gone to the doc twice and that was back when I was 12ish. I find it EXTREMELY difficult to tell my mom, (emphasis on EXTREMELY). My mom has seriously no patience and is usually busy and forgets about things i tell her and I'd much rather avoid telling her about the constipation(also very embarrassing). I'm super reluctant to ask for help until it gets really bad. Which is, very bad and I'm super aware of it. This is really stressing me out.  Extra info: I don't hold in my poop anymore (I did when i was younger due to extreme anxiety with using public/school bathrooms and sometimes even at home) but now I can't help but 'hold it in' as i get barely any urge to go(hence i can only go up to 2 times a week). I typically get the urge twice or less per week where I'd have a bowel movement. I also always have to strain whiile going (maybe not with almost liquidy stools) it's not full on straining but im definately pushing a fair bit to get it out. [actual problem] Stool is wayyy too large to pass (i managed to squeeze a small bit out, however i didn't strain too much because im terrified of anal prolapse). I feel very backed up. Wondering if there's anything i can do now? What would a doctor say/give me?? And about my problem with not getting an urge- will they want me to get a colonoscopy??(do not want under any circumstances) Was also wondering if the stool will still be hard to pass and if I'll still have to strain if i use an enema?( not that i even have one  ( ). How do enemas feel? Please describe in detail? Sorry for all the questions and messy explanation, this is just stressing me out and idk i get real emotional and depressed due to it.

The panic stopped after a while and I went straight to A&E.  They did numerous tests, ECG, chest Xrays, blood tests, you name it and in the end they said they agreed with my GP that it was  costochondritis.  They put me in Diclofenic tabs, which are anti inflammatory.  They did help and the condition eased up after a few days but it wasn't long til it reared its ugly head again.  so for me its 2 weeks of severe pain and maybe 4-5 weeks of bearable pain then back to severe pain again.   I am down at minute but this time its really bad, it seems each time I get it It is more severe. I am now on naproxin which to be honest I find useless. Pain killers are not working and even the hot water bottle which I found great is no use this time. The majority of my pain in in my back between my shoulder blades and travels up into my neck and shoulders, sometimes down my arms. Although I have chest pain the worst is in my back, though if I were to press on my ribs at the front I could scream with pain.   I find this time with it being worse it is affecting my moods. I am snapping at my little girl all the time which I feel terrible about, and I just dont want to do anything. Work is just a nightmare recently. I am normally an upbeat person and very little gets me down, but it is really taking its toll. I have had this condition now for 2 years and it really in not understood.  Most people I talk to have never heard of it, so when I found this forum and so many people suffering like myself it was a God send.  So hopefully I can gain some knowledge from other people and anyone panicking about the pain they are feeling and thinking its something bad, can take some reassurance from my story. Does anyone feel the pain is in their back more then their chest area.  And if anyone has any advice or anything, please do share with me. Sinead 10 likes, 604 replies "
Costochondritis and Tietze's Syndrome,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/over-a-year-with-chest-tenderness-rib-popping-extremely-frustrated-534140,"Over a year with Chest tenderness, rib popping... extremely frustrated","A little over a year ago while performing dips at the gym I heard a pop in my chest but paid no mind due to not having any pain, however, a few days later while doing dips again I dipped down and could not push myself back up due to the intense pain and lack of chest strength that I gather came from the injury. For the last year I've seen numerous doctors in every discipline imaginable, attended physical therapy (stretches, icing, strengthening) with 3 different providers, attended a chiropractor in 2 different practices, I've had X-rays, MRI and CT scans performed,  and they still can't figure out what's wrong. One fo the doctors performed an ultrasound and thought my sternoclavicular joint was the issue but a MRI shut down that diagnosis. The closest diagnosis is Chostochondritis, however, the symptoms do not improve, I still have tenderness in my chest area, pec area and my back where the ribs connect, my ribs continue to pop every single day for no reason, when I stretch or when I sneeze. I'm extremely frustrated I can't get this issue cured and even more I haven't been able to identify what type of doctor can help me. I've done a lot of online research and I've seen others post comments with the same symptoms but not a cure or a type of doctor that can treat it.

When getting the ultrasound of my gall bladder, I realized the pain was on TOP of my ribs instead of under.  AND it seemed to be where the cartilage was on images I pulled up online. These are my symptoms over the course of the month (some of them were only in the beginning and some of them come and go). heart pounding heart  weakness  (feeling drunk) no appetite urgency to pee waves of nausea blurred vision Heres my questions- My pain is on my right side just below the sternum where the ribs start to bend and at the very lowest rib on the same side (which is why i think I thought I was having kidney pain).

Contraception,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/kyleena-coil-side-effects-689594,Kyleena coil side effects,"Hi, just wondering if anyone has had similar side effects to me with the Kyleena coil. I had it put in about 6 weeks ago after coming off the pill as I wanted something with less amount of hormone. I've just had my first period with it in and WOW has it been an emotional rollercoaster. The pain has been awful and not seemed to subside at all, I've been having hot flushes, gotten spotty, feeling extremely bloated and super emotional with anxiety (lots of crying haha). Has anyone else experienced anything similar? I feel I should give it a little bit more time to settle but right now I just want this thing out! The only non-hormonal option is the copper coil which I've seen has many side effects too. To have no contraception would be a dream but I'm not ready for any babies yet! Does anyone have any advice on what my next move should be, do these kind of symptoms get better over time with the coil? 0 likes, 0 replies "

To recap, after having agonising stomach cramps - so bad i ended up in A & E (have had milder versions before for the last 2 years), inflammation that moved through to bowels and the into pelvis. Lost 5 kg in 4 weeks, was incontinent for 2 days diarrhoea so bad. Was in a lot of pain for 4 weeks, then an MRI scan shown a 6cm abscess next to my right ovary. Mri scan also showed bowel thickening. Doctors think it is likely to be caused/ secondary to a form of IBD -so basically inflammation moved through to pelvis and caused the abscess there. Has anyone else experienced this? Usually abscesses in pelvis are cause by pelvic inflammatory disease from an STI- but my STI results were negative- (I knew they would be), and so doctors think most likely from IBD- possibly Crohns. Am still waiting to see a Gastronomist  inflammatory bowel disease specialist (NHS appointment in January) and get a colonoscopy for a diagnosis. Also I saw a nutritional therapist recommended by a friend of mine recently, she put me on the elimination diet to see if I had allergies or if anything was making the symptoms worse, but I came off it as I was feeling very week after already loosing so much weight. Also currently raw veg , nuts and pulses do not agree with me at the moment (so was not much to eat on the elimination diet, where you have to give up dairy, sugar, gluten, eggs, soya, corn, caffeine and alcohol-or the one she recommend I had to...). Anyone else had experience of the elimination diets- surely can't be good, after a bad flare up, where one may already be nutrient deficient etc? Thanks. 😃 0 likes, 0 replies "

I suffer with horrible nausea, sweats, high temperature and extreme fatigue - all I want to do is sleep for hours on end! Some months I have nearly passed out, the pain is so bad. I'm hardly eating as have no appetite either. I visited a specialist yesterday, did a full blood test and gave stool samples in today - I did notice that my stools are very, very dark and have like a sticky, tarry consistency?

They have been brilliant and told me that whatever the diagnosis, they will help me through it. However, I feel that this is more than just IBS. I am on my 8th day into my flare up now and will probably still be suffering on Christmas Day.

I have started to cook my food myself.  Not fast foods for me.  I have started to eat healthier and I feel that plays a big part in overcoming Crohn's disease.  No sugar, No fried foods, No processed foods.  I am also eating all kinds of vegetables, you know the one's that you never eat or that looks fun.  I also have taken out beef, chicken, and pork.  I only consume seafood.  I took all breads out of my diet.  So far I have been feeling great.  As for the Crohn's some of my systems have gotten milder.

Crohn's Disease,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/5-year-old-with-crohns--696339,5 year old with crohns?,"Hi my 5 year old has had intermittent pain in his bum for 2 years. A few weeks ago my poor boy was in so much pain he couldnt walk so i checked him and found a massive lump near his anus. At the hospital they took him down to surgery where they found a large abscess and a fistula... they cleaned and drained the abscess and fitted a seton with a view to operate in a few months. They took bloods and biopsies and mentioned chrones to us... although they were not worried as he is so young. 3 weeks later i call for biopsy results and the surgeon still hasnt looked at them. The biopsies were inconclusive but showed 'chronic inflammation' The consultant still has not contacted me about this. His bloods were pretty normal apart from mild anemia and inflammation markers were up (due to abscess?) Would an abscess or fistula show as chronic inflammation? Or is there something else going on? It seems highly probable to me that he has this but docs seem unconcerned due to his age. Its so rare apparently. Im out of my mind, its been 3 weeks plus the 2 years on top of chasing.

I know doctors know better than you guys but still have a few questions. can being ""unwell"" really cause ulcers in the bowel? the doctor I last seen said the symptoms do match up with chrons disease because I get stomach cramps, diarrhea, toilet multiple times a day and recently diagnosed with b12 deficiency.

I ran across a wonderful video about the keto diet and chronic pain that illustrated exactly where doctors in America are in regard to diet in treating disease states.  These two doctors described putting their diabetic patients on the keto diet and they not only controlled the diabetes, they had a host of other good things happen, one of which was their   DISAPPEARED!  This occurred over and over, so these two docs got together and gathered research to figure out why and presented some rather interesting ideas why. This is just one informational video at this place I found when you combine the words diet and doctor with dot and com.  Some of you on here have shown much greater understanding of what's going on than obviously most MD's have, that's because of the neglect in our education when it comes to nutrition and diet. We were taught just order a consultation from the nutritionist.  We presume the nutritionist knows what to do LOL.  Well, maybe not, with the current food pyramid now falling apart, with my own cholesterol level falling 20 points after a scant 2 weeks on the keto diet.  I think we all need to take a good look at nutrition and diet again.  The reasons that the two doctors found for the keto diet helping with chronic pain were quite reasonable, I am still waiting for it to help with my chronic pain, but I haven't given up hope no matter what the clinical pathway is! In any case the video is well worth watching. 0 likes, 24 replies "

Colonoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/colonoscopy-experience-no-sedation--672614,Colonoscopy experience (no sedation),"Disclaimer : everyone experiences pain differently and I don’t want to cause alarm to people waiting for a colonoscopy . So my colonoscopy wasn’t a positive experience at all .The moviprep was absolutely vile , I recommend diluting it even further than instructed as you end up dehydrated anyways regardless of the enormous quantity you have to swallow and it is very sickly sweet and salty. I am very thin at 8&1/2 stone so don’t believe the whole 2 litres was required as it made me so unbelievably ill on my second jug full that I was vomiting hours later  and lay on the bathroom floor the whole day leading up to the colonoscopy (honestly couldn’t move )  So as far as the procedure is concerned , the nurse told me I cannot have sedation as I had been vomiting ,I agreed this was fine and didn’t want it anyway as I am terrified of canulas , she said “perfect scenario then ” So I get into the exam room and the doctor says we need to do sedation this is very uncomfortable(confusing) , I tried but even the tornequay made me want to pass out so I said no and we went ahead , no gas and air was offered even though my letters said it would be an option . He shoved the camera into me without warning and seemed very annoyed at me that I wasn’t having sedation . The air being pumped to straighten the creases was very painful and I have had quite a lot of procedures  in my life , they luckily managed to have a look at the entire colon because at the last minute I was screaming no more , all in all it was in for 5 minutes and done with biopsies that are kind of like an electric shock feeling (not painful just weird and I could only feel the rectal biopsies ) Pros to having no sedation : no canula and short waiting time in recovery got to go home after a cup of tea. You could also drive yourself if you wanted (with a plastic bag to sit on just incase you ruin your seats !) Cons: 9/10 pain when they pumped the air (they do this about five times as they go around the bowel)  All I’m all I would say go for it and get it done you really can’t beat piece of mind but if your not afraid of needles and canulas then go for the sedation definitely. 0 likes, 3 replies "

Two weeks should crack it, plus you get a holiday to boot with loads of distractions from the everyday stresses you have at home.

I have a gp appointment next week as I really want to know what it is, as I have never had any other testing then a blood test for coeliac. Can you have dh with a negative blood test? Do you find your rash worse at night or in a bath? Am I right in asking in for further testing? Thank you in anticipation and sorry for the long post  0 likes, 4 replies "
Coeliac Disease,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/the-trouble-with-diagnosis--663410,The Trouble with Diagnosis...,"I start this thread with a big massive ""sigh!"" I am fairly certain I've experienced the five stages of grief lately, in regards to the loss of my sanity and my faith (and patience) with doctors. I'm a 34 year old woman in Australia, and can't remember a time where breads, gravy, pastas or rye breads etc etc, didn't make me feel like throwing up, or made me curled up in pain. I recently went to the GP to organise an endoscopy, in which case she said no. She said that under the public system, unless we (the GP) have done enough research first, and found evidence that would suggest I may have coeliac disease, they won't allow an endoscopy. I don't believe this is true - I know people who have had endoscopies without much to go on. I told her that I had been doing a LOT of research into the disease, and my symptoms should not be ignored. Our public system here is pretty damn good - so I'm not sure she's telling the truth... She asked me what my symptoms were, and I got through about three (out of many more) before she started talking over me. She said my previous blood test for coeliac came back negative, therefor I don't have it. I told her that the blood test is frequently a false negative, having known someone with coeliac (discovered finally by endoscopy), and her blood test came back negative also. The doctor looked at me like I was full of s**t (so to speak) and I told her that for some, it is a very hard thing to diagnose. Why am I telling her this? Shouldn't she know, you know... stuff? 🙄 Then at some point she said ""we can look into other tests to find out more. If you DO have irritable bowl syndrome, there are other ways to find out""... um, did she just say that I implied I had IBS? Yes - yes she did. And I (quite annoyed at this point) corrected her ironically ""IBS is not Coeliac disease...."" and she finally heard me (I do think that half the time, she wasn't listening) and said ""oh yes of course. I know."" And that was the end of that... I asked her for a referral to a specialist in Sydney (about 2 hours away). She said ""that's a private one""... I responded ""yes I'm aware, but maybe he will actually know what to do"".  ""You will probably have to pay for it"" she added ""I'd rather pay for it and find out sooner, than try to fight the public system for an endoscopy and continue eating foods that cause me endless suffering"".  Ughhhhhhh! Ok, deep breath.. and out.  So she decided to send me for another full blood check - the last ones I did were back in November.  Back then: My liver levels were high, to the point they were concerned. My inflammation was up, and my iron was on the low side. This time: the inflammation was a bit more normalised, the liver levels were back to normal (I knew this could be related to anything - not alcohol because I barely ever drink, but perhaps high sugar in the diet. I quit drinking energy drinks, so it was likely that - nasty stuff if that's the case!!!)  This time, my iron had dropped another 3. I haven't had less iron foods in my diet, in fact, I probably have more than I did in November, and I'm not losing blood anywhere, so not sure if this is related to Coeliac, or something else. I do wonder if they will continue to drop. Overall, my blood tests appear decent enough - which of course means the doctors look at the text book Coeliac blood results and say ""you're fine, off you go"". But how is it fine? How is it OK to ignore someone's symptoms? I went off gluten for about a year until someone said it was necessary to eat gluten in order to know if I had Coeliacs. Thus I went back on it for the tests, and I knew then it wasn't in my head (even though these doctors put some doubt in my head at times). The first four weeks of eating gluten again, I experienced all of the symptoms I'd had before, but so much worse than I'd ever had: migraines, dizziness, lethargy, interrupted sleep/restless sleep, nausea, ""puffiness""/swelling, bone and joint pain, stomach cramping (pain that grew and shrunk, if that makes sense - like brightening and dimming a light), diarrhoea and constipation- often in the same day, my vision worsened (but I wasn't sure if this was from lack of sleep) mood swings, and depression that got to the point where I genuinely wasn't sure I wanted to live. I looked like hell, and the little tiny bumpy/pimply rash on my arms and legs was more prominent again. Does this sound like a person who is well? What good doctor would look at those things and ignore them because the blood tests were OK? I've seen two GPs now, and both had that dismissive attitude. I leave feeling totally deflated, angry, and like I want to cry. Some days I feel like just plain giving up (on the diagnosis, not life).  Who the hell gave them so much control and power over what we were allowed to find out about our own bodies? So here I am, eating the equivalent of at least 6 pieces of bread each day; I wake up with puffy fingers most days, and have to force my rings off. Every meal is followed by cramping and bloating. I feel so tired of trying to make people listen, to be met with naivety and ignorance.  Excuse my need for a bit of a vent session, but I also would love to hear anyone else's thoughts and experiences. I don't want to give up, even though part of me is just ""done"" with it all. Some of us are lucky that the diagnosis period is quick and easy, while many others feel like they're alone, standing before a bunch of medical professionals who tell us our word means nothing because we don't have a PhD in medicine. Please do share!  Side note - I have attempted to make an appointment with the specialist but it was a bit weird - I had to have the GP fax the referral to his office, then he will mail out an appointment time. So the wait for that begins. Will keep you updated on the next stage. Fingers crossed 🤞  Thanks for reading xx 0 likes, 3 replies "

Here is what I posted.  I have been diagnosed with Celiac disease for a couple years now and I react strongly to some food but not as much to others. If I eat cake, more then one cookie, english muffin and especially beer I react pretty strongly. Bad stomach problems, gas, although not being able to release it, bloating and just plain feeling agonizingly sick to my stomach. Then on the other hand I can eat chicken nuggets, hamburgers with buns, sandwiches with white bread and I don't seem to react. If on occasion I do it's very minor. If I go crazy eating it these things every day then I will certainly begin reacting of course.  Is it a matter of some foods begin more concentrated with gluten or what is it. How is it that I can eat a McDonalds hamburger with a bun and feel fine but I get sick to my stomach when eating an english muffin? I'm confused? 0 likes, 4 replies "

Coeliac Disease,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/new-to-coeliac-disease-struggling-676023,New To Coeliac disease - struggling ,"Hi, this might be a long post but really needing some help and advice...So I'm new to this disease and have only been told a week ago by my GP it's highly likely I've got Coeliac disease and will be having a biopsy to confirm this in November. I've been gluten free since a week prior but accidentally severely glutened myself over the weekend before last with a few foods I thought were safe. I've been off work loads since symptoms started kicking in in April this year and have now been off work for the last two weeks due to the severe pains from being glutened. It's given me terrible anxiety, depression and despite genuinely wanting to get back to work I cannot get out the house without nearly throwing up repeatedly and having severe pains in my stomach most mornings. I've used paracetamol, peppermint tea, hot water bottles and even had my husband massaging my abdomen to try move what feels like trapped gasses around. Massaging it has worked in the past but other times (more recently) not so much. Back in April, I was planning my wedding for July this year (4.5 months to plan everything was rather stressful to say the least) and I don't know if that triggered off my symptoms and coeliac would have just come out another time in my life. I would say I've suffered with anxiety since my early teens, I used to have IBS when I was very young, and have never had good energy levels. I don't know if this means I've had Coeliac for years and only just now it's come to the fore?  We've been super strict over this last week but I'm still very anxious, exhausted, weak, nauseous and in a lot of pain that has kept me awake at night. It might be worth mentioning I live on a working farm that works mostly with wheat, rye and barley. Will living here have a negative effect on my health? How long does it take for symptoms to clear up and to feel 'normal' again? Is it normal to have this much pain that I'm bent over a LOT of the time, nearly throwing up but never actually able to and almost instantly in pain and severely bloated after eating most meals? What's helped you all get back in control of your health and life? Has anyone has symptoms like mine? Any advice, or even if others have had a similar experience to what I've described would be great just to know I'm not alone or if there's something I should be doing that will massively help me??

At 6 p.m. I took 30mg of lansoprazol (I take it every evening). Than I ate puff pastry with gluten at 8 p.m. At 2 a.m. I woke up because of the most horrendous acid reflux ever.

The last major episode, had me in hospital the pain was so bad, I was rocking on the floor with stomach cramping, tired to take a paracetamol stomach too tender, vomited it up. Again inflammation moved from abdomen to bowels, a lot of pain. But this time it didn't go away for a while. Had such bad diarrhoea, was incontinent for 2 days and had to wear adult nappies. My bowel movement eventually went back to normal, but pain got worse in my pelvis.I lost about 5kg in 4 weeks as had no appetite and was  in pain. MRI scan showed a 6 cm abscess in my pelvis next to ovary- drs thought caused possibly from inflammatory bowel disease that moved through to pelvis. Anyway this has been treated with antibiotics (and it wasn't an inflation due to an STI as these tests were negative). Cut a long story short I have now cut out gluten as I don't seem to get flare ups when I'm off it. And I do seem better- could it be  celiac diseased?

Codeine and Paracetamol (Co-codamol),https://patient.info/forums/discuss/am-i-a-codiene-addict--681494,Am I a codiene Addict?,"Hi. I am looking for some advice really. Firstly, I get ill a lot. I'm a 35 year old male, professional and work hard. About 7 years ago, my girlfriend (now wife) gave me some cocodamol (30/500s). Whenever I was ill or needed to sleep I would nibble a 1/4 of a tablet. Over the years since, I have began taking them more and more often. When ill at work I would take one - maybe once a fortnight. This led to two when I was ill. When going to the doctor for back pain about 18 months ago, he gave me a 100 box to save on prescription charges. I got a box every 3 months or so before asking the doctor for pure codeine - I said it was because i wanted the option to 'top-up' if standard pain relief didn't work, however, I just didn't want the paracetamol.  I then started to take them at the weekend - something to look forward to on a Friday. Before I knew it, I was taking 180mg a day 3/4 days a week (I needed a couple of days off so that I could have a poo). About 6 weeks ago I realised I had a problem - had two weeks off and thought 'I can quit when I like' - may as well get back on them. I'm now completely out of codeine but have started asking people at work casually. Found one random 30mg on Saturday and took it straight away. Not sure if I'm in withdrawal or not, but it's not overpowering - I just want one if that makes sense. If I continue, will it get worse? Every time anyone in my family gets given codeine I always end up finishing them off. I speak with people at work and loads of people seem to be on either codeine or tramadol and say 'it doesn't affect me' - I can't see how it doesn't though. By the way, I've never taken more than I should (60mg) and never taken a dose early (less than four hours in between doses). Any advice would be greatly appreciated 😃 xxx 0 likes, 1 reply "

I hope it helps you! ,"im 34 years old,  i was First prescribed 30/500mg  codeine  for a back problem 15 years ago. As the years went by i became addicted. the doctor  prescribe me 100 tablets every three weeks. However, it was never enough! So I started searching the Internet, started going to local pharmacies, and when that wasn’t enough I would travel 30 miles plus Just to get some Over-the-counter medication i.e. Co-Codamol. It was basically taking over my life, I would wake up in the morning and the first thing I would do is take eight tablets in one,  two hours later I will take another eight and so on... I started getting into debt I was spending roughly £14 a day on over-the-counter medication (nurofen plus) as well is having 100 tablets prescribed from the doctor per month....My mood changed I became depressed and I even left my job as i didnt have time in the day to go and find more codeine.. About six months ago I decided enough was enough and I made an appointment with my doctor. It was the hardest thing  I’ve ever done admitting I was an addict.  The doctor told me I could either slowly decrease the amount I was taking (tried that)  or refer myself to turning point (NHS drug misuse clinic)  so that’s what I did, I referred myself to Turning Point and I’ve never looked back .  I spoke to a practitioner in Turning Point about how much I was taking and it was decided that buprenorphine would be the best course to take. In order for buprenorphine to work you have to Withdraw from codeine for 24 hours once you have withdrawn you are then prescribed buprenorphine. I started on 12 mg per day the first couple of days were difficult however once it was settled in my system, I then started to feel a lot better.  you have to Withdrawl from codeine for 24 hours, once you have withdrawn you are then prescribed buprenorphine. When you  our prescribed  buprenorphine, you are  supervised  by The pharmacist and you have to attend every day until your practitioner at turning point feels you’re able to be put on collections.  I was Supervised for 6  months. I  haven’t touched a  codeine Tablet since day one of the 24-hour withdrawl. The buprenorphine  changes the way your body reacts, it makes you think you’re taking codeine when you’re not and helps with the symptoms from withdrawal. Today I have started my buprenorphine reduction I am reducing half a mill every two weeks to make sure that I don’t relapse and dont feel the withdrawl symptoms.. I am 100% committed to never touching codeine again. I nearly lost my family, my home and my own sanity. Buprenorphine is only addictive if you misuse it. You’re practitioner will put you on the right amount so that you don’t become dependent on it. Be honest with them, so they can work your dose out! ANYONE CAN REFER THEMSELVES TO A MISS USE DRUG CLINIC i hope this helps 😃 and good luck to everyone!! please reply if you have any questions! 0 likes, 3 replies "

It has coincided with me suffering a very heavy flu like cold which had started before i stopped the pills. however after 4 days in and whilst i am feeling relatively drained i feel as though i just have  a heavy cold and so far i have had no real desire to collapse back onto the drugs. my current symptoms are. Lethargy, a bit loose on the toilet, feeling fluey but not too bad. a bit emotional thinking about my children and grandson  (but this actually helps as i keep telling myself that i will be able to be a far better granddad to my 2 y/o grandson who idolises me and me him.)  a bit insomnia waking up about 5 but lying awake till morning.  other than this i dont feel to bad at all and what is strange is that in the past when i have just gone one day without the drug the withdrawals were awful and far worse. i am unsure why this time i feel relatively OK and from what i understand at this point after 4 days things should start getting better day by day. luckily my appetite has not suffered at all so i am eating well, juicing healthy fruits and eating veg, taking vitamins etc so i can see the benefits of ridding my self of this drug. I just wonder when the lethargy will start to ease as to me this is what has dominated my life for so long. i long for the morning when i wake up full of energy and step outside at 7 am breath the beautiful air and know that i am truly over this addiction. a little bit of inspiration that has helped me was reading a book called ""recovery Freedom from our addictions)"" by Russell Brand. theres lots of little wise comments in there when the cravings hit such as thinking about where you would be in one hour after giving in and taking the pills. Basically meaning in as little as an hour your buzz would be over and you'd be back to square one again. One other bit of personal advice i would like to give anybody who is currently going through what i am is to remove the problem from the equation, if like me you cannot fully bring yourself to get rid of the  vile toxic pills. then remove them to somewhere that makes it more difficult to get to them. I have an allotment which is around 1 mile away from my home. i have stored the pills there. it has worked well for me as i know they are there if i should need them but as my routine was a night taker there is no way i would be able to go and get them when i would need them, subsequently knowing i cannot get to them helps curb the craving as if they are downstairs in my cupboard its simply a 30 sec trip down the stairs to collapse!! may not work for everyone but if this helps at least one person then thats great. Thanks for reading and would love any feedback that can help me be one of the lucky ones. Neil x 0 likes, 1 reply "

Having came out the other side I then spent longest 4 months off codeine then found myself going back on it and off for the next year. I found myself making excuses to myself where I would say I was only  going on it for 3 days to get the euphoria feeling but weeks later I was taking more than what was recommended just to get that feeling. So I am now 3 days since last codeine and have to say if hasn't been too bad really - insomnia is the worse but the diarheoa and headaches seems to be okay. Unless they are still to come.  But I am looking for advice to be able to stay off it?! I have a very easy access to it and a lot of it so that can prove difficult at times. just looking for people experiences of staying off it?!

I would love to know what you experience whether you get any pains in your body due to the high consumption? I have tried to look online for the answer but cant find anything. I have read that taking codeine a lot can cause kidney damage and other symptoms but how many tablets do you have to be taking for that to happen? surely 40 plus would be doing that?. it would be great if anyone had any in depth symptoms or effects on their organs.

Sure you need to be close to the toilet but did not experience stomach cramps and managed to get a good night sleep before the afternoon appointment. The hospital do offer mild sedation given intraveniously and I am glad I took it. I did experience mild discomfort despite the sedation and was ""explored"" for quite a while as the surgeon removed a couple of small polyps which hopefully are harmless.

I have posted about frozen shoulder and neurological pain, which brings me here.  In December I had an arthroscopic capsule release to help frozen shoulder. Not long after that I started to get quite severe nerve pain in the wrist. It was the opposite arm but it was where the drip was put in.  Since January it has gotten progressively worse, now it’s in both arms with nerve pain, regular episodes that are horrendous, my fingers curl up into a fist and I can’t release them until it is all over. On Sunday this happened 5 times, not a nice feeling. I’m now getting pain in the biceps and elbows. Anytime I move my wrists I get pain and I’ve stopped wearing my watch because it’s painful and I’m too sensitive to wear it.  Now all I’ve read about CRPS this seems to be the problem but at the moment I’m on the specialist merry go round. I think because I’m t1 diabetic they are thinking that it’s neuropathy. I’m getting a lot of answers that are unsure or we don’t know or your symptoms don’t match with what we were thinking. The pain specialist I saw was the first one to say that he thought it was CRPS but I now have to wait till August to see him again because of the public hospital waiting list.  I have not worked since October last year, first because of the Frozen shoulder now this. As if this CRPS, if that’s what it is is bad enough, I’m still getting over fs and my range of movement is very limited and it’s bilateral. The surgeon is positive it’s nothing he did.  So to my question, how long does it take for a diagnosis of CRPS? I’ve been told it’s a diagnosis of exclusion so I guess I have to wait don’t I?

","Hi all, I am not a sufferer of crps, but my 15 year old son is, I have joined this group to try and gain some advice. We are in the UK, so the advice I am looking for will primarily (at this point) come from sufferers with this awful condition come from this country. About 6 years ago my son was diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, after about 3 years this fortunately went into remission, but it left him with chronic pain, he was under Leicester pain clinic for this for a while, he used lignocaine patches which helped a little bit, but mainly he managed it himself with pain killers and rest.... Up until about 3 weeks ago! Basically that day he woke with severe pain in both his ankles, both knees, and his groin, to the point where he could not move any of his joints at all, not only that but you couldn't even touch the joints without him screaming out... So we got the ambulance to take him in hospital, thinking maybe his arthritis had started up again.  Once at hospital the arthritis was ruled out and the consultant diagnosed him with crps... But unfortunately the doctors at Lincoln hospital have never dealt with this before, so they are in the dark how to deal with it. Numerous phone calls to Leicester, Sheffield and great ormand Street paediatric pain clinics ensued, for advice. Physio, counselling, pain management medication & desensitisation programs was what they were told.  Unfortunately Lincoln hospital can only give him physio, as the other services are not available there... Lincoln were advised to try my son on ametrypoline, but this gave him vivid nightmares so he was taken off it, they then tried gavapentin, which also gave him vivid night terrors, so that too had to be stopped.... But they haven't started him on anything else as they are not sure how to deal with it. Leicester, Sheffield and Great ormand Street only do paediatric outpatient appointments to their pain clinic, and the earliest any of them can offer is 7 months away!! !. My son needs inpatient transfer to a paediatric hospital that deals with this not as an outpatient as clearly with my son not able to bend his legs, or even walk on them this is impossible.,but as an inpatient. So my question is. Does anyone in the UK know any paediatric hospital that deals with children's pain as an inpatient, so he could be transferred from Lincoln to somewhere that knows how to deal with crps, that is all under one roof.

This discomfort/pain happened two or three times throughout. I had two polyps removed. It was possible to watch on the 'tv' screen but I didn't opt for that.  (The NHS Endoscopist and the Nurse which I conversed with about the procedure itself and many other things throughout the procedure were fantastic).   13 likes, 108 replies "

Now, that would bring me up to three spinal cord stimulators.  Well, for one thing, I have run out of butt cheeks to put the dang generators in LOL. Second, the SCS in my neck really isn't working all that well and so I have neuropathy in my arms. I am on a fairly high dose of what I fondly call my "" Fat and Foggy "" drug, gabapentin to deal with the arm pain and also the CRPS pain in the leg.  It does it's job, it works pretty well for the pain, but I am getting tired of being both fat and foggy.  Not to mention, I have a host of other drugs besides gabapentin I would love to wean down. So, the more I thought about what would be best for me, I figured that DRG would only help my right leg and that pain pump would help my WHOLE BODY.  The answer became crystal clear, even to old fat and foggy, and fortunately for me, Dr. E is a pushover for me and he let me have the PP with no argument. I have run into other CRPS patients online who have PPs, some of them for over a decade and they seem to like them very much for the pain.  I know that my lower SCS reaches to my ankle and it just can't seem to kill this pain.  I know the DRG was going to hit that ganglion, but somehow I think morphine straight to the brain sounds best to me. Anyone on here have any experience good or bad?  I will let you all know how my trial goes in case anyone is thinking about doing it. It is going to be a 10 day trial, I hope I get the home bolus feature!  LOL.....I have this fantasy that the morning after I will wake up for the first morning in years and have NO pain, NO aches, just feel normal.  I can't wait.

However, my old bladder issues are suddenly coming back to life. A year ago I had to undergo 6 months of pelvic floor physical therapy to get rid of massive pelvic floor muscular over-tension. Those muscles had themselves so worked up into a state of constant tension that my whole abdomen felt like it was on fire all day long. It was awful. They told me at the time that is happens to chronic pain patients, those type of semi-involuntary muscles just stress out when your body is subjected to constant pain and stress. I am now thinking it was CRPS starting up. In any case, I am feeling it again and am petrified of having to go through all that again. Has anyone here been diagnosed with bonafide CRPS of the bladder or just the abdomen?  What does that feel like?  I am hopeful that the intrathecal pain pump will alleviate this pain too, but just in case, I have started the ball rolling to get an appointment at the pelvic floor PT place.  0 likes, 0 replies "

The surgery went well and my knee is looking and feeling great! I had a femoral nerve block which they believe may not have worked as I was in a large amount of pain after surgery and I spent a few hours longer than I was supposed to in recovery. About a week after the surgery (just as I started trying to walk without a crutch), I started having a sharp pain that came from the inside of my ankle. I ignored it at first, but it starting getting worse. After a few days, I started having electric shock pains radiating up my leg from my ankle and the area became very sensitive and felt like it was burning. Around this time my shin just below my knee also had similar symptoms (burning and sensitivity to light touch) and recently I've also had electric shock pains radiating from it. Both are sensitive to having blankets on them or going into water. It's painful but I wouldn't say it was excruciating. The burning and sensitivity to light touch happen when I'm sitting down and the electric shock pains only really happen when I straighten my leg and the first few steps when I start walking. A few days after that I started having tingling and burning in my two outside toes of my operated leg and that had now spread to the soles of   of my feet. All these pains get better when I start walking around for a couple of minutes. The longer I walk around and do my physio exercises the better they get. I can touch all these spots and the pain usually subsides for a second as well. Hard pressure seems to be much better than soft pressure. My doctor put me on Lyrica (100mg in the morning and 100mg at night). This seems to have worked quite well. I'm not pain free, but it's much less noticeable - although the tingling in the soles of my feet isn't really affected by the Lyrica. It only started when I upped my dosage of Lyrica - so I'm not sure if it's just a side effect. My surgeon believes I may have CRPS, as he was adamant he didn't go near any nerves, but every doctor and physio I've seen doubts that's true. I don't have any skin discoloration, swelling or temperature changes. From what I've read CRPS is not something you'd want to have. Can anyone who is familiar with the condition comment on weather they think my symptoms are related to CRPS? It's really starting to worry me that I might have it.

My right wrist has slowly gotten better but was still painful depending upon how I moved it. My orthopaedic doctor suggested 2 weeks ago that I may have CRPS, this has now been confirmed. I have been in relentless pain in my left arm since day 1 of the injury and as of today 5th of October, my right wrist has also started hurting quite badly for no apparent reason and my hand movement is becoming rapidly restricted. Is it possible that my CRPS has spread to my right wrist so quickly? I am due to see the pain management team at my local hospital within the next couple of weeks. I have been taking co-codamol 30/500 since day 1 of my accident and they don't seem to be helping much any more.

Coagulation Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/planets-elevate-666882,Planets elevate ,"I have a question about platelets. My platelets in April were 391 in May they where 386 about a week ago they where 403. Back in early March I was told I had low iron. My ferritin was 2 and is now at 20. Im on an Iron pill. The low iron and ferritin was due to a diet I believe. My hemaglobe was 11.5 and is now 13.3. I had bilateral pes in November of 2016. Was on thinners for 6 months and then taken off in may 2017. They are not 100% sure where my pes came from but possibly kicking a door 20 or 30 times. My mom is on blood thinners for life as she said she got pes a couple times in her early 30s. Im 37 in a week. She says she does not have a blood clotting disorder but my mom never gets checked out by a doctor. I was tested in 2016 after my pes for clotting disorders and I don't have any. My pulmonologist I just started seeing in the middle of this year also said he ran test for certain clotting disorders and did not find anything. My pulmonologist also said when I had him read my   from 2016 that he can't tell if I had a pe or not due to the ct scan being not so good. But none the less I have to assume I had one. My sister also had a dvt. But she also had surgery a few weeks prior. Can anyone help me understand why my platelets would go up and down and do I have anything to worry about with getting another clot being my platelets being 390s to 403s? Or is it due to my iron? 0 likes, 0 replies "
Coagulation Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/cvst-with-wife-666304,CVST with wife,"Hello,  It has been about 18 months since we found out that my wife had CVST, and it has been a journey. She had just given birth to our second child, and thats when she started having her headaches. She thought it was a sinus infection, so she kept on pushing along, but the headaches became worse. Her left leg started to twitch, so we knew at that time something wasn't right.  We started to the hospital that second, and she experienced a seizure on the way to the ER. Obviously I was terrified and our newborn was in the backseat. I called the ambulance, and they picked her up and rushed her to the hospital. It wasn't long after, that the Dr came to talk to me and let me know she had a clot in her dural sinus. Thinking back, Im so glad they were able to diagnose it so fast. She spent a few weeks in ICU and then acute care after that. She was put on warfarin and keppra for a while, but we were unable to get her INR levels right. They switched her to Arixtra which is an injection blood thinner, but we went with this one so she could continue breast feeding while using this one...this was very important to her.  It has been a journey regarding her building her strength and energy back up. She utilized a walker for a long time after the event, and her walking was showing much improvement for a while. But after about 12 months, the Dr took her off the keppra, and her walking showed immediate improvement. She still has residual effects when she goes in high sensory places with alot of movement...malls, restaurants, etc. Her head hurts a little, and her left leg starts to get weak. She has been getting stronger, and we are hopeful she continues to get better. Last month she had a checkup with her neurologist, and we found out that her clot had dissolved which we were very happy about. We will just continue working on her getting stronger, and hoping the residual stuff improves. She has recently accepted a job offer starting in August, so we will see how that goes. I feel she is getting closer to where she was, but no doubt there is still some work to go.  Just looking to chat with other people that have had similar situations. I find it therapeutic to get guidance and news/ updates from others. Thank you guys.   0 likes, 0 replies "

He first noticed it a few weeks ago. He doesn't have any medical conditions or   other than hay fever. He isn't on any medication. He has gotten two spots. One is a singular red dot and the other is a smaller dot that comes with patches as well. The patchy spots only happened once. Both of the spots start bleeding randomly without any physcial contact. He says it's not causing him any pain, just some irritation now and then. They bleed for about a minute and then stop. The spots completely go away eventaully. He doesn't know how long. He says they usually happen in areas he sweats a lot. It has happened underneath the elbows, under his knees and his calf. He said he got spots recently on his genitals but the spots were a lot more sore and irritating and had lots of little spots of dry blood. He says he has thin skin and a possible reason for the spots is the heat. Not sure if this is important but sometimes he skips meals or doesn't eat enough. He doesn't drink a lot of water either. Sometimes he goes an entire day or two without drinking water. I've never heard of this before. Should he be concerned? He says he doesn't want to make an appointment.   0 likes, 1 reply "

I just wanted to post about my current experience as I recently joined the Citalopram club 2 weeks ago. I got hit with pretty bad health anxiety and slight   a few months ago but at the time I didn't know it was that, infact I sometimes still doubt it but i suppose thats what health anxiety does. It started when i randomly fainted in my house which really scared me. Luckily I didn't hurt myself but went to A&E anyway. The doctors put it down to   and to be fair I had a very heavy session in gym that day so it all kinda makes sense. I carried on with life but it must of triggered something in me as my   started small and over the span of a few weeks and months escalated. I got extreme fatigue,  , weight loss, lack of motivation and interests, unpredictable emotions,  , dizziness, brain fog. so i was convinced I had something wrong with my body or brain. First thing I did was go to doctors and explained my situation. She did multiple blood tests and it all seemed fine. She suspected a thyroid problem as it runs in my family and my levels were abit abnormal so she did more blood tests a few weeks later and my thyroid levels went back to normal. After a few more weeks of doctor visits I finally broke down as I just couldn't turn off my mind and the thoughts that something was wrong, plus googling everyday really didn't help. My doctor prescribed me 20mg of Citalopram. Ive never been on any medication before so this was all new to me. Luckily I found this website and read alot of all your questions and experiences which helped alot.  The first few days on it was an awful experience. I got really bad insomnia, non existent appetite, heightened anxiety, low moods, depersonalisation,  extreme fatigue, weight loss. In fact I pretty much stayed in bed for the first few days watching and reading harry potter trying to keep my mind focused. Im glad to say that alot of my side effects have calmed down and because of that I feel alot better. I still get fatigued, the odd headache and sleep problems but compared to how I was im feeling better. I know I am at very early stages of this drug and I still do feel ups and downs but Ive read that usually means its working. Overall with the help and expertise of all you wonderful people on here I know we can all get through this can come out on the other side a better person.

Im not really looking for a medical diagnosis...more support i guess as i am twisting myself up with anxiety and worrying beyond belief... Its regarding my 13 year old daughter.....she started getting nose bleeds fairly frequently...id say maybe one or two a month then nothing for a month then again..She hasn't actually had one now since May. Anyway i took her to the doctors to obviously get checked out as it was obviously worrying her too. The doctor asked loads of questions and then requested a blood test. I took her for the blood test then when i rang for result (4/5 days after) the receptionist said that the doctor has said ""can you please book a non urgent appointment, i can do in two days?""wink even though she said non urgent i immediately started thinking the worst and thought that because she gave me a appointment so quick something must be wrong. Anyway once we got to the doctor the doctor said that when they did her PT test (to see how quick her blood clots) it should take up to 12 secs or something like that and hers came out at 13.5 or 13 (sorry cant remember exact i just know it was very minimal) They said that perhaps it was just her body changing etc, she paused and said i think i will refer her to a haematologist. She then said wait here while i talk to another doctor about what to do next. She went out the room came back and said what we will do is repeat the test in 3 months. So 3 months later i took her again (Monday just gone) rung for results Thursday and the receptionist said the same thing....can i book a non urgent appointment. She then said ""i can give you an appointment Monday""wink Again im worrying myself silly at what they will say...ive been torturing myself all weekend and convincing myself they will say something awful....Im panicking even more at the thought of them saying they will send her to a haematologist as i always thought that once they do that they are thinking it might be cancer/leukaemia? I know to some of you it may sound silly but i really am getting myself worked up over this..... im scared im worried....she has no other symptoms...she eats very well and is probably very slightly over weight (but shes changing) She sleeps well and is growing correctly....she started her periods when she was 11 and did say they were heavy but after talking to her they seem to be pretty normal to me however maybe slightly erratic...... I don't know here fathers side of medical history unfortunately which doesn't help either.... Is Chelsea the favorite to win the London  0 likes, 0 replies "

Cholesteatoma,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/cholesteatoma-without-symptoms--649950,Cholesteatoma without symptoms? ,"Hi, my ENT recently referred me to a specialist because of a suspected cholesteatoma. As a baby and young child, I had many ear infections that resulted in a number of tubes. My hearing loss went undiagnosed for a while until a teacher noticed I wasn’t responding. I was 95% deaf in my right ear and 100% deaf in my left. I cannot remember how long this lasted but it was through elementary at least. My ENT was talking about rebuilding my ear drum but my hearing came back and since then I have had little to no problems, so that’s why I am surprised. It seems from what I have read, most people have some sort of symptoms. My ears pop often and when I get sick they’re really clogged, all things I assumed to be normal. I’ve gotten dizzy spells a few times recently and the reason I went to see an ENT again was because of a constant whooshing sound in my left ear (the diagnosed ear), especially when I would lay down, but that too has mostly gone away. I get the occasional ringing and do suffer some hearing loss of high frequency sounds in my left ear. I also had gone to a specialist about five years ago because my GP thought I should be in pain from the amount of scarring in my ears and sent me to an ENT who suggested I get looked at because of my history and how much scarring I have. But I only remember him mentioning middle ear surgery (I assumed this was different) “eventually” and didn’t seem particularly concerned, so neither was I. I won’t see this new specialist for another month so I guess I’m just overwhelming myself with information ahead of time and wondering if it’s possible to have this issue without any significant symptoms or did I just find the right ENT who may have spotted something others may not have?? 0 likes, 1 reply "

Cholesteatoma,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-experience-of-laser-surgery-for-cholesteatoma-removal-655315,My experience of laser surgery for Cholesteatoma removal,"I am at week 7 after having my cholesteatoma removed by laser in mid March this year.  To be totally honest it was quite a shock back in February to be told that I had something called a cholesteatoma and that it would need to be removed ASAP. I then made the fatal mistake of coming home and reading up all the information (and horror stories) on the internet.  So I thought I would like to give a first hand account of my own experience for anyone that is about to have this op.  My actual experience was a lot better than I was anticipating (and what I had read about!!!!!). The operation lasted between 3 -4 hours and I had an overnight stay in the hospital. During the operation my cholesteatoma was removed using miniature laser precision instruments, a titanium strip was used to repair the damaged hearing bone and my eardrum was repaired.  The operation was performed by Mr Hamilton who specialises in this technique. I feel as though he did a very good job. I had no pain, dizziness or balance problems immediately afterwards or in fact in the last 7 weeks. When I came round from the op I had packing in my ear and a turban type bandage holding the dressing in place. The turban was removed the following morning before I left the hospital but the next 3 weeks my hearing was very limited with the packing.    The internal packing was removed three weeks after the op and I had to have some small dressings inserted as there was still some seepage happening. Apparently in children the ear will repair itself much quicker....but I am on the wrong side of 60....so its taking longer!!  After a further 3 weeks wait I returned to have the dressings removed. In another 6 weeks time I will undertake a hearing test to see what sort of hearing I have recovered. I am feeling optimistic that I will have some decent hearing levels as I can already notice that my hearing is getting better in that ear. It has good days and bad days. At the moment I seem to have the pulsatile tinnitus returned again but I am happy to say that its not anywhere near as severe as it was prior to having the op. Some days my ear feels quite full and I don't hear so well from that side....then a few days later it makes a few strange noises and popping sounds and my hearing seems better. But its only week 7 and I understand that its a long process of getting the ear canal settled back down to a dry ear and normality. I am happy that I've had the op as its got rid of a pretty miserable time when I had 24 hour round the clock severe pulsatile tinnitus.   I am glad that I chose to have it done by laser surgery as the recovery time is better apparently (there is less bleeding with laser so less blood and debris for the ear to try and absorb and get rid of during the recovery period)   I just wish I hadn't read so many horror stories on the internet beforehand....as I had got myself worked up into quite a state before the op!!!!!   I hope this has been helpful to anyone about to have surgery. 0 likes, 3 replies "

Child Health,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/precocious-puberty-29542,Precocious puberty,"I am writing this posting to gain some further understanding of the premature puberty. My daughter was 4 1/2 when I noticed her having proper body odour.  The doctor said that some kids just get it and for her to wear deoderant.  I was never totally happy with it as it didn't seem normal to me.  My daughter has always been tall and slim for her age and I have always been concerned that she is a little too tall.  Last summer, aged 5 1/2 I noticed she seemed to have more hairs on her legs and a couple of dark pubic hairs.  I took her to a new doctor, as we had moved, and he refered her straight away to the paediatrician at the hospital, as when he looked at her height he thought she was alittle too tall for her age. A year later my little girl has breast buds and is having injections every 4 weeks to halt the puberty.  She has had all the blood tests to check her hormone levels which were positive for puberty, as well as her bone age (currently 8 1/2) by xray.  She has had an   of her brain to check for tumours and ultrasound scan of her pelvis for polycystic ovaries.  She has been very good with it all but all she knows is that she is growing a bit too fast and the doctors want to slow her down a bit. We have been told by the paediatrician that it is best for her to have these injections otherwise she will start her periods, which they do not want her to do.  They have also told us that unless they halt the puberty that she could end up short because she has already started her growth spurt which will finish 4 years too early.  She is already 4ft 4 at age 6 and in age 9-10 clothes.  Her puberty doesn't seem to be linked to obesity though as some papers seem to sugest as her BMI is healthy for her age and height.  Unfortunately they don't seem to have an answer as to why this has happened to my daughter. We are finding the hardest bit is the teenage strops and temper that appear to be coming with it.  We have been told to expect her to be more grown up in age and expect the hormone strops because the injections contain a massive overdose of the puberty hormones to confuse her body.  She does seem to be struggling with concentration and odd little behaviour issues at school which we feel could be related. If anyone else is experiencing this kind of thing it would be great to hear about it!! 1 like, 23 replies "

Child Health,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/impaired-sexual-maturation-associated-with-sleep-apnea-syndrome-during-puberty-692637,Impaired Sexual Maturation Associated with Sleep Apnea Syndrome During Puberty,"Hello All, First off, I wanted to say how awesome and engaging this community is. Thanks for having me. It's a pleasure to actively engage in discussions with the most important thing in everyone's life -their health. This is a case study that was published in 1980. This case study highlights on impaired sexual maturity due to sleep apnea during puberty. From what I hypothesize and what is highlighted in this article,  ""data suggest that sleep apnea during puberty may impair sexual development by preventing the sleep-related elevation in LH secretion normally observed during a critical period spanning puberty"". The case study was performed on a post-pubertal 20 y/o male that had sleep apnea. LH and Testosterone serum levels were measured before and after improvement sleep apnea for this case study. Significant improvement of pulsatile nocturnal LH secretion were concomitant with treating sleep apnea for this patient, but genital size was not improved. I hypothesize that this may very well be a hugely undiscussed epidemic that is prevalent in modern society which may be accounting for smaller sizes in men, for which many so quickly blame smaller sizes in men on ""genetics"". Sleep apnea during puberty may very well impair optimal growth of genital development in men and women.  Sleep apnea, especially during the pubertal period, can also be to blame for many disorders in adolescence and adulthood like ADHD, obesity, low muscle mass, fatigue, lines under eyes, daytime insomnolence, and many other outstanding health issues. If LH is not being optimally secreted to do fulfill one of its responsibilities in growing the genitals to the genetic potential for the patient during this critical period spanning puberty, will genital development be permanently halted after the pubertal period elapses? If continued sexual development cannot be achieved due to the interruption established by sleep apnea via an unknown mechanism, the billion dollar question is...is there a medication or solution that exists to reignite or continue this event that already occurred during puberty? If my hypothesis is true and there exists a remedy for impaired sexual maturation caused by sleep apnea during puberty, many men with below average genital sizes may attain normal/larger genital sizes by continuing growth. Any questions or comments? Thanks for reading. 0 likes, 0 replies "

For as long as I can remember, I have struggled with a mental illness that significantly effects my everyday life. It is extremely difficult to explain, but I can best describe it as a constant dream-like, almost zombified state.  I used to describe it as a mental fogginess,  like a feeling of staring through a fog, but at this point I feel like I'm trying to stare through a wall. I feel a complete disconnect between my ""soul"" and my body. The dream-like state is my primary symptom, but I have a few other notable possible symptoms as well. For starters, the one most visible to others is my social ineptitude. Other people have described me as a ""non-entity"", I typically get totally lost in any conversation and by the end am giving yes and no answers and smiling and nodding excessively. When I speak, I often slur and trip over my words and completely leave out or rearrange sections of sentences. I am terrible at expressing myself verbally, although I consider myself to be competent at expressing myself through text, although it takes me an excessively long time to write things (like this discussion). I am prone to losing my focus on any task, and frequently lose myself for hours, simply sitting in one place twiddling my thumbs until I realize that I have zoned out for an immense period of time. I forget to do essential tasks every day, such as bathing, shaving, brushing my teeth and even eating. It took me a very long time to get a doctor that took me seriously, but now that I have I have undergone a variety of tests trying to nail down what is ailing me. I EEG tested negative for epilepsy, got an MRI that showed no mental abnormalities, took an array of   that came back completely normal, took a fusillade of personality tests that showed no psychiatric issues, and finally took a few cognitive function tests such as the number-connecting test and performed very poorly, prompting my diagnosis with ADD. I have been taking a high dose of both Strattera and Bupropion for a few months and, after learning to control the side effects by taking the pills with food, I feel absolutely nothing from taking the pills. I might as well be taking sugar pills, because the medicine has no effect. In a few weeks I will begin taking Adderall, but I don't have high hopes for the results of that given my results so far with non-stimulant ADD meds. I have researched everything from Depersonalization Syndrome to  . I simply cannot find anything on the web that matches my symptoms. One thing is for sure, though, I haven't seen testimony from anyone with ADD that describes my symptoms. I am currently struggling through college, and am starting to become concerned that even if I get my degree, I won't be able to land a career due to my tendency to zone out and not do any work. I am becoming increasingly concerned that I will not be able to financially support myself as I get older. If you've read to this point, I'd like to thank you again for your time. Does anything I've typed here ring a bell for you? Do you think you  know what could be ailing me? Do you think that I actually might have ADD?

My facial hair is so little it is often mistaken for dirt. I have also NEVER shaved my face.  I only have a tiny bit of pubic and armpit hair. My voice never changed, instead it got deeper gradually. Even though I am an adult male and have been for many years people still think i am a 15 year old boy. I have very small testicles and my penis is less than 2 inches. i rarely get erections and i have never had a ""wet dream"". i also have 0 sex drive. although i am attracted to females, i am not attracted to them sexually. i am a virgin and want to be like that lifelong. i like hangin out with girls that are 10-13 years old better than grown women because it seems like all grown women want are romance and sex which i do not feel either. I understand i am a grown man so i cannot be in a physical relationship with a 10 11 12 or 13 year old girl but i dont desire a physical relationship with anyone. i like hangin around with girls but i dont want to talk about romance or fashion, i wanna talk about gaming, movies, youtube but i cannot find a grown woman that wants to chat about these things they only want ROMANCE!

I am socailly awkward and i do have poor social skills but i love making friends and I cannot get enough social interaction.

I have low ambition and low motivation, i dont have a problem with eye contact, i am very very friendly, i do NOT excel at english or math, i am not ""obsessed with anything"", i dont care for repitition, i can read social cues just fine, and i do not have a superior IQ. I do like to talk about myself a lot though and sometimes struggle with back and forth conversation but I dont freeze up. I am also a very easy going guy, and happy most of the time and i have got a tremendous patience level but i got very depressed when i found iout i did NOT have Klinefelters. i always knew there was something different about me and something that made me act like a much younger child and something that made it hard for me to play sports and learn at age level but when i was about 11 i heard of Klinefelter syndrome and all these years ive been so confident. I was overjoyed to finally get the medical treatment to pay for my diagnosis and while i was waiting to hear back from the doctors i planned to be a HUUUUUGE supporter for Klinefelter syndrome but when i got the letter that said I did not have it and my chromosome type was 46, XY i was so disappointed that i was not a Klinefelter man and what i had assumed all these years was wrong and there is something else wrong with me.

If this isn't the right place for this post, or there is a better place for it, please let me know. Roughly 5 weeks ago, my 2 year 4 month old boy started acting very lethargic and just overall weird.  After four trips to the hospital / clinic, the doctors finally identified that his blood pressure was dangerously high, like 145/100.   They admitted us to the hospital and then ICU and slowly brought his blood pressure back under control with Labetelol and Norvasc. Since then, we have been searching for a cause (and solution) with no luck, and we're running out of things to look at.   We have, at times, suspected a pheochromocytoma, renal artery stenosis, seizures, heart problems, and more, and, essentially, the doctors are running out of things to look for.   I can provide more detail if desired, but here are some of the things we've done: I'm sure there's more that I'm missing, but the doctors have essentially exhausted their testing.  He's on 2.2 milligrams of amlodapine (Norvasc) twice daily and it more-or-less keeps his blood pressure below 110/xx, but we have been having to add in the Labetelol recently on an as-needed basis to keep it below 120/xx.

I was treated with a medication called ""ELIGARD"" (euprolide acetate for injectable suspension), which I don't believe is the common medication given.  This was given to me via injections every 3-6 months until I was aged 10. Lately I've been trying to look at information about this condition to try and understand what exactly happened to my body, partly just out of curiosity and also to try to understand whether having precocious puberty has effected me in other ways since the end of my treatment. But a lot of the information I see about Precocious Puberty is vague and seems to refer more to children who are diagnosed when they're 6-8. There's also a lot of information that connects precocious puberty with obesity which doesn't really apply to me seeing as I'm actually slightly underweight and have been that way for the majority of my life. From what I've seen there isn't much information at all about what patients experience after treatment.  I feel as though my puberty has been a lot more intense than most other girls. I'm currently taking a contraceptive pill to regulate my hormones as suggested by a psychologist, as it was causing me a lot of emotional distress. Though, to be fair, quite a few girls also do this not just those who had precocious puberty. However, I'm still curious to know whether other girls who had precocious puberty have also experienced other hormonal issues or more intense puberty after the end of their treatment or whether my experiences are just coincidental.  Any information would be really fascinating to me. So it would be cool if anyone else had any stories to tell about themselves or people they know. 0 likes, 0 replies "

In my 30s I was diagnosed with ADD, I was given a titration of Vyvanse which as the dosage got larger I it put me to sleep harder. It was almost the same as taking a sleeping pill. I was then put on Ritalin. Same deal. Although quicker and didn’t last as long. Adderall again. Same deal. More I take the more I need to drop a sleep. Which also means I am absorbing the medication as it is having an effect. I have tried ldopa/ l-tyrosine no effect. When taking any stimulants I don’t get that rush, it’s like a damp cloth on my brain. My doctor is at a loss, he’s never seen someone take higher dosages of stimulants and it put them more and more a sleep, even with a high tolerance. Another attempt was Atomoxetine, plus Ritalin, plus ldopa. It just made me sleepy and gave me a sore head. When taking Ritalin/ Adderall the epinephrine/ norepinephrine rush isn’t there at all, it’s almost the opposite, it sedates me.

Chiari Malformation,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/post-op-674425,Post OP,"Hi all. I'm a long time chiari malformation patient. I had decompression surgery with a laminectomy a little over 15 years ago.  I wasn't expected to walk again due to other spinal problems, but I walked out of the hospital. My question is: is there anyone out there who has had the surgery years ago whose having symptoms again. My balance, co-ordination, and memory is getting bad again. I'm not having severe headaches but I've got really horrible neck pain.  I had an MRI done 2 years ago, but it didn't show anything new.  The neurosurgeon that did my surgery is no longer at the practice, he's now a pediatric brain tumor specialist. I haven't found a neurologist who will consider chiari as a reason for my issues.

My husband had the surgery for chari malformation. He was doing fine, feeling quite nauseas and sick, but nothing that couldn’t be handled with anti sickness tablets and some food. He’s afraid of being sick, and it seems the anti sickness tablets have stopped working, he’s afraid to eat or even take his pain medicine because he might be sick, and when he gives in and takes his pain stuff he throws it back up because there’s nothing in his stomach. I’ve tried talking to him about eating more, to try and help but am accused of bullying him and being mean by both him and his mother (who is currently at our house constantly to look after him because he calls for her every time he throws up). I don’t know what to try, his dr just changed the sickness tablets but that hasn’t worked and he hasn’t eaten anything substantial for two days without throwing it up.

Chiari Malformation,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/decompression-surgery-in-january-2018-674807,Decompression surgery in January 2018,"I just wrote something really long out and my phone disconnected from WiFi and now I have to start over! Ok so I had decompression surgery on 1st january 2018.  I am still getting severe head pain, mostly from laughing and coughing. And more than often from doing nothing more than simply waking up in the morning, which is bizarre to me.  The most alarming thing I have noticed recently is that I am EXHAUSTED. I just started a new job (after 4 months off from recovering) and I do 8 hour days. I literally come home and collapse into bed. I am mentally drained and my eyes pretty much shut as soon as my head hits the pillow. My body has zero energy and my mind just wants to shut down.  The second thing I have noticed is memory loss. This one is a little more alarming for me as I’m only 29 and I have an important job. It’s happened a few times now and I’ve only really noticed it when it was something quite scary... I was walking to work and suddenly stopped. My mind went blank. I couldn’t remember where I was or where I was going. It took me a good minute before I regained memory.  Thirdly is clumsiness. This one is hard to differentiate from my normal clumsiness but I definitely don’t usually fall over all the time, or have difficulty holding a pen or unbuttoning my blouses. This is another thing I have noticed over the passed few months.  I’m honesty just hoping this message resonates with someone on here. You don’t have to reply with a long message but just simply an acknowledgment that someone has read mine. I’m feeling so alone, anxious, scared.  My biggest fear is that the surgery hasn’t worked. I won’t get better, and I might get worse.  Thank you for reading and look after your head! X 0 likes, 19 replies "
Chiari Malformation,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/head-rush-swimming-strange-pressure-floaty-feeling-in-neck-pulling-behind-left-eye-headaches-528279,"Head Rush/Swimming, Strange Pressure/Floaty Feeling In Neck, Pulling Behind Left Eye, Headaches","Okay, I really don't know where to start this. I don't know if I should post this here, or in multiple boards, seeing as I'm not sure what in the hell is wrong with me. A few things first though:  1. Diagnosed with Chari Malformation Type 1 when I was 10 years old. This found while an MRI was performed on my spine.  2. Diagnosed with Scoliosis before Chiari was found. My spine started to curve when I hit puberty.  I don't EVER remember having symptoms from my chari, well, except the curving spine. They decided to operate on me anyways. I had a dural placed in along with a slight shaving of my skull, at least this is what I remember. I was young and my mother, having suffered an aneurysm when I was 13, she can't remember much of my surgery's either.  After my Chiari surgery, I had no issues. I was slower atheletically, but that's it. My spine didn't stop curving after the Chiari surgery, so I had scoliosis surgery...I had harrington rods placed in.  This was 17 years ago.  In all of these 17 years I have NEVER had issues with my Chiari. A headache here, a headache there...but that's about it. Oh, and the occasional bad gag reflex. I was a cheerleader, worked out, basically jumped around my whole life. Traveled a lot, partied a lot, I mean...I was doing a LOT! No problems! Last year, after I moved to France, I started feeling...odd...shaking, headaches, etc. Well, I decided to quit smoking too (10 years heavy smoking), and that was ROUGH! But I managed! Yay!!! I was quite stressed though last year. First year of marriage, living in a foreign country, learning a totally new language. Not to mention the fact that I was living in Paris during the terrorists attacks...so, I was a bit on edge for awhile whenever I would ride the metro or be in large public places. I've noticed a few symptoms really started in January, first being a weird heart beat, then a lot of headaches, and now a weird dizziness EVERYDAY. But it wasn't until 2 months ago, when I started exercising again, that they seemed to came out of nowhere, especially the dizziness. I do NOT have vertigo. Things aren't visually spinning, nor is my head, but I FEEL dizzy in my head. It seems to radiate from the back of my head to the top. It's like when you squat down for awhile, then stand back up and you get that head rush/dizziness. I also have this VERY strange sensation at the back on my neck, in the middle between my shoulders and base of my skull. It's like a heavy pressure, but also feels a pulling sensation. When I get the headrush, I get the weird pressure and pulling sensation at the back of my neck. Now, how many times do I get the head rush? ALL. DAY. LONG. I'm not joking. It comes in waves when I'm standing, and when I move my eyes to look around BAM! Or when I barely move my head, BAM! Typically when I look down it starts too. I even feel it when I sit, and sometimes when I'm lying down. And it definitely happens when I'm walking. There is this weird jolting through my upper back and neck. Wanna know the funny thing?...If I hold my head in my hands, wear headphones, put my hair up in a ponytail, drink a little bit of wine, or even when I'm brushing my teeth or hair ... this sensation seems to be muted. I still feel it a little, but not as much. That's REALLY weird. I know it sounds strange, but this is the truth.  Another strange symptom is a weird pulling behind my left eye. It's like a pulling, and then it goes down into my nose...like the sensation where you're going to sneeze? Kind of like that but not so harsh.  Since January, I have also noticed a weird skipping in my heart. It feels like my heart wants to jump out of my chest or struggles to beat properly. It does it at times that make absolutely no sense. Like today, I bent over to grab my purse and it happended for a second. Or when I lean over to get stuff out of fridge. Sometimes while lying down too. This seems to be more frequent.  As for headaches, they seem to be slowing down but I still get them every other day.  So, here are my symptoms in full:  - Headaches, accompanied by a sharp stabbing pain at the top left side of my head.  -Pulling sensation behind eye, which spreads through my cheek bone and down to my nose. Happens more when I'm more active. - CONSTANT head rushes/swimming feeling at the back and top of head. This happens when I'm just standing there, moving my eyes around, when I'm sitting, sometimes when lying down. DEFINITELY when I'm walking around. I can feel my footsteps vibrating up to my neck and then a head rush/swimming/dizziness starts. Sensation is muted/dull when holding head in hands, or leaning head into palm. When wearing headphones, have my hair in a ponytail, brushing hair or teeth or when a little tipsy from wine. Sometimes even touching my head makes the head rushes stop for a moment. I kind of feel like I'm glitching at times too - Weird heart palpitations/jumping. Happens very randomly, heart feels like it's about to jump out of my chest and feels like it's struggling. - Pain at the top of back, in between shoulder blades. Really annoying.  - Sometimes I have some pain in legs or hands... - Feels well in the mornings but after 30 minutes to an hour, symptoms start. I am 40 pounds overweight (because I quit smoking) and I know this is bad for my harrington rods; I try to stay away from gluten, I WAS stressed a lot for a few years (during uni and dealing with a long distance relationship) but not again until recently when these symptoms became horrible. I'm scared. I'm upset...and my poor husband doesn't know what to do. We moved from Paris to a smaller city in the West of France, and well...things just became so crappy now. I'm so upset...I don't know if this is my chiari or if there is something else going on. I want my life back!!!  I have had an MRI of my brain, and the doctor said he saw nothing...then again he wasn't a neurosurgeon. He said everything seemed fine with the rest of brain...so now I have been scheduled to see an ENT, have an X-ray on my spine, and to get a blood test for diabetes, thyroid, etc.  Does anyone EVER feel these symptoms...?

Following the surgery she had a rough recovery and it turned out that a hole had formed in the dural patch that was installed in her dura mater.  Once determined, she quickly had another surgery to repair the hole.  Through the process we befriended the family in the neighboring ICU unit and learned that their son had the exact same surgery and the exact same problem, resulting in the exact same curative surgery to repair the hole in his patch.  In speaking with the surgeon we learned that the holes were created from a reaction in which an adhesive (Adherus developed by Hyperbranch) that was used during the surgery essentially ate a hole through the bovian patch that was installed.  Has anyone else experienced a hole in their dural patch?  Or, has anyone experienced leaking through the patch that could have been caused by a sealant? I have reported the incident to the FDA.  They acknowledged receipt of the complaint, but I am not aware of an outcome.

Chiari Malformation,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/anyone-else-have-cardiac-problems-678218,Anyone else have cardiac problems,"Where do I start? January 2017 I first went to the doctors with sudden waking at night and dizziness (as well as many other unpleasant symptoms). I was quickly diagnosed with vertigo, prescribed Prochlorperazine and referred to ENT. My first appointment they concurred however my second with a different doctor didn’t agree with the vertigo diagnosis believing it was something else and referred me to a sleep clinic and for an MRI. After a few tests for sleep apnoea this was ruled out. My MRI, however, showed an arnold Chiari malformation. A further referral to a neurosurgeon was done with a second MRI to check my cerebral fluid flow. During this time, my symptoms were worsening with chest pain and a numb left arm being thrown into the mix. Another visit to my GP resulted in a referral for a 24 hour ECG. The results from that showed I had 4 episodes in one night of tachycardia whilst asleep so the doctor diagnosed arrhythmia. A cardiologist appointment had already been arranged but not until the beginning of October. In the meantime hardly a night goes by now without me waking with one symptom or another and I’ve had to go off sick due to lack of sleep and inability to do my job properly (I’m a community nurse). I’m worried obviously and would like people’s thoughts. I’m trapped in this horrible world and it has affected my mood considerably which probably doesn’t help. I haven’t got stress or anxiety from my job which has been suggested. By the way my cerebral flow was fine so discharged from neuro now, my Chiari is a watch and wait. It’s rare I have issues with tachycardia during the day other than palpitations on occasion and every now and then tachycardia after eating. At the moment I’m controlling the best I can but I’m truly fed up now after 19 months of this. My Chiari symptoms I control by myself or meds.

These skeletal conditions are known to be associated with Chiari. I haven’tt had an MRI yet as it takes time for it to be scheduled. A chiropractor adjusted my neck a week and a half ago. It hurt in the middle-to-upper left neck region when he did it. Ever since then, I’ve had off and on pressure headache in the back of my head. It is fairly mild. It doesn’t last long at all, maybe just a few minutes and then subsides. Sometimes when it subsides I feel a sort of fizzing or sizzling as if the pressure releases and then the pain subsides. But the fizzling or sizzling also happens sometimes even when there’s no pain. It's kinda like when you press your tongue against the back of your teeth and lift it to the roof of your mount, and then suck your saliva inward. Sounds and feels about like that. I also have some mild pain and pressure in the left temple. One time when I laid down I felt the rear pain shift to the bottom side of my head. I also have off and on pain in the side of the neck where the pain was felt at the time of the adjustment. Do any of these symptoms sound alarming as early or mild Chiari symptoms, particularly the sizzling or fizzing sensation? Can you hear or feel spinal fluid (CSF) forcing its way through a partial blockage? I really feel for those of you who have to deal with Chiari.

I realize none of you are medical professionals, I just wanted to know if I am completely off base. I have pretty severe pain on the back of my head when I laugh, and I'm super dizzy everyday. I can't always drive because I'm so dizzy, and have so much pressure in my head it feels like it could explode sometimes. I have stopped working for almost 2 years now because of all this and my doctors have no answers. They keep saying it's anxiety, but I am in pain and dizzy beyond belief. Would anyone mind looking at my MRI stills and just commenting if I am way off base, or if I might be on the right track? I am already planning for an appointment with a new Neurologist.

Chest Pain,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/chest-pain-over-the-heart-691320,chest pain over the heart,"I am suffering from left chest heaviness/discomfort for the last 10 months since February 2018 on a daily basis lasting almost all hours of the day. I am a male, 42 years old, smoking many years, not known health issues– only cystitis on the bladder removed through cystoscopy last year. This left chest discomfort is mostly below the left nipple and sometimes move to the left (on the armpit) or to the right (close to center of chest). This feeling/pain makes be miserable and prevent me from every day activities including work. When happens sometimes I feel like to faint and seek emergency advise as soon as possible. Not much stress at work. AT times I do not have that feeling heavy headaches are coming. When initially started (February 2018) I went to the emergency and made all related exams (ECG, blood testing, X ray) which came back fine. After for a period of three months I went another 4 times to the emergency doing the same with same results. In addition, I have been to various professions (cardiac, gastro, pulmonologist, neurologist, neurosurgeon, rheumatologist, physical therapy). All related tests including ECGs, echo, Trend mill, CT heart with dye (cardiac), CT thoracic, fluoroscopy, endoscopy, colonoscopy (gastro), various blood tests including prostate, thyroid etc., CT chest, various X rays at numerous directions, X ray neck, and physical examination by neurologist were found ok. In addition, I did physical therapy including TENS, magnetic fields, laser, and massage. However, although the results of all tests were ok I was having the same chest discomfort on a daily basis which was a bit relieved only by placing hot plaster at chest. At early June 2018, the gastro doctor has prescribed amitriptyline (at 10mg daily before sleep which later on increased to 20mg). After some time (2 weeks) chest heaviness/discomfort was reduced in frequency to the half (instead of daily it was every two to three days). However, at mid-September I realize that amitriptyline was not adding any value and thus I stopped it. A week after the chest heaviness/discomfort came back more intense every day lasting the whole day and did not go away with ibuprofen, paracetamol, etc. The only thing which a bit produce a relief was capsicum plasters placed either on the back or chest side (due to the heat the discomfort was felt taken off). I went the last three weeks again to the emergency and GP and prescribed with baclofen which I took for almost two weeks with no results at all. Then, last week, the gastro doctor advise to start again the amitriptyline (initially to 10mg). As a conclusion, after having all these exams and pills nothing has been improved and the chest heaviness/discomfort is still here all day every day. Doctors told me that is something muscular/neuro, however, when I asked them whether it is costochondritis, fibromyalgia, or rheumatic polymyalgia they told me that they do not believe. As such the matter was left open with diagnosis of atypical chest pain. Can you please help me??????? 1 like, 1 reply "

Chest Pain,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/recurring-pneumonia-and-pain-690579,Recurring Pneumonia and pain,"Hello. My name is Lauren, I'm 27 years old. I'm in good health apart from this complaint. I rarely drink, don't smoke, but I am quite overweight. I have very mild asthma. I'm a stay-at-home-parent of two children. In December 2017 I caught flu, which developed into a chest infection. With it, I had a pain in my right side, which felt like a pulled muscle. I was prescribed abx and got  better until mid-January (2018) when I developed tonsillitis and crackles could still be heard on my chest. More abx . I got better but in February, required abx for my chest again. The pain in my right side got worse around this time, and lingered after I got better. Then I started to get low-grade fevers every day and had raised CRP in my blood. GP referred me to respiratory specialist however before I got an appointment, my fever and heart rate went very high, the pain got much worse to the point it hurt to breathe in, and I was admitted to hospital with pneumonia. Strangely, the Drs couldn't hear anything on my chest, and I wasn't coughing. It was diagnosed by xray. That was in March. I had 3 days of IV abx followed by 2 weeks of oral. The pain in my side lingered for a while, but follow-up blood test and xray showed the infection had resolved. GP actually thought the pain was in my shoulder, not connected to the pneumonia, and suggested physio. All Drs I came into contact with were surprised I had become so ill given my age and general good health. Over the summer I was in good health and the pain gradually went away. In October, I noticed it was back.  Its hard to describe, its like a strained muscle, sometimes it feels like its in my ribs, sometimes my shoulder and round my back, sometimes right inside my underarm. Sometimes it hurts to move, sometimes it hurts taking a deep breath. Some days its worse than others. It feels like it should be sore to the touch, but it isn't. I thought maybe I had slept wrong, or hurt myself carrying boxes (I  had just moved house). With no other symptoms, I didn't think too much of it, especially as GP thought it was separate to the pneumonia. Mid-november, I went to the walk-in centre with a fever  that was barely coming down with paracetamol, and a heart rate of 145, and worsening pain on my right side. They called an ambulance. A chest xray revealed that it was pneumonia again, this time more widespread, and I was kept in on IV abx for 7 days. I was told that I'd be referred to the respiratory clinic as an outpatient, to investigate why I had become so ill again. Initially, the pain in my right disappeared.  However, when I started to feel better and do more things, I noticed it reappear on occasion. Now its there pretty much all the time. A couple of times, I thought I felt the same pain on my left side, but I'm not 100% sure. The pain in my right side is particularly bad today - I can feel it on every movement and it is sharper than usual. No other symptoms. I've got a follow up xray tomorrow, which I suppose will show if there's any infection still there. I haven't heard about my referral to the respiratory clinic yet. I'm just really fed up. I'm still so tired. The pain is concerning me. Would it be normal to still feel some pain 6 weeks after a bout of pneumonia? What will the respiratory specialist do? I've been tested for HIV, TB, Legionella already, all were negative. What could be the cause of all this? Any insight, opinions, stories of similar experiences would be greatly appreciated.

It did not. I've been smoke free though going on my 3rd year. I tried getting a massage in hopes it would help my discomfort. I even saw a chiropractor. Will try acupuncture next.

For past few months I have been experiencing regular pain in lefts side of my chest which has increased recently together with pain in my left arm and shoulder. I started noticing some weird pain in left side of my chest about 4 months ago. At beginning I felt this pain several times per day in waves that sometimes lasted only about 10 minutes but sometimes even 2 hours. The intensity of pain also varied, at some points I could barely notice it and other times it was pretty uncomfortable, but it never got too severe and unbearable. After about 3 weeks of this pain I went to my doctor, he did some basic examination, but did not found anything. He just said that I should take some vitamin B supplements and use some topical pain killer cream to manage pain. I also did some basic blood and urine tests which didn’t show anything unusual and I also got echocardiography done and doctor said that that everything looks fine. In following couple of months intensity and frequency of pain decreased. I still felt it almost every day, but it just wasn’t bothering me as much as before so I thought it was getting better, but last week the pain started getting worse again and for past few days I feel it basically all the time. The intensity still varies, but in average it is definitely stronger than before. Now I also have noticeable pain in my left arm and shoulder and at some points I also feel light pain or stiffness in my back, neck and jaw. Researching my symptoms online suggests some kind of heart problem, but in those cases pain seems to be more periodical, but I have it all the time and I also haven’t really noticed shortness of breath and the pain doesn't get worse when I am moving around. I have scheduled another appointment with my doctor in a few days, but I still would like to know other people opinions on what might be wrong. What possible conditions fit with my symptoms and are there any other things that I should monitor and pay attention to? 0 likes, 2 replies "

Chest Pain,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/long-term-unexplained-chest-pain-246818,"Long term, unexplained chest pain","Hi all After struggling with docs for years over this I thought I would turn to the wider world some input. I am a 27 year old, healthy (enough) male who has been getting intermitment, iregular and infrequent chest pains on and off for around 10 years.  During an 'attack' the pain can be quite severe and sharp - I guess a bit like being stabbed. The pain is localised to the left side of my sternum and feels fairly deep (i.e. it cannot be palpated).  Attacks can last anywhere from a few seconds to a day or so, and tend to come in 'clusters' that can be present for up to a week. There can be months between each cluster of attacks (if you get my drift!). Pain can sometimes be exacerbated when leaning forward, coughing, lying on my side or raising an arm (seems to always vary - and can sometimes not have any stimulators). During a 'cluster' period and between attacks I can often feel a mild, underlying ache in my chest. This is easy enough to ignore however. I have had ECGs and chest xrays that have all been fine, and am not affected at all during exercise - I can happily go out and run 10k with ease. Doctors have in the past rulled out gastro refulx as there was no tenderness on palpation of my stomach area, although I have sometimes thought that attack can follow a big meal and be accompnied by burping (although this may be my mind tricking me).  Muscolskeletal problems have been mentioned, but why would attacks come in clusters and seemingly out of the blue?

I have trawled these forums and the internet in it's entirety and i have not found anything that resembles all of the combined symptoms i am having. This is a long read and i am extremely grateful for anyone who takes the time to read and reply. I'm male, 25, 6'2"" and 16st on the button. The week commencing 10th April i suddenly began to have these very strange sensations up and down my arm whilst at work - they may be painful for some but i would not describe them as particularly painful just very evident. It really rattled me and sent me straight into flight mode - i ran to the toilets, to the car, i could not stop moving. As i'm sure everyone does, i immediately thought heart attack. It subsided and i generally felt ok for the rest of the week and even forgot about it until Monday 17th April where at around 9:30pm i suddenly fell ill - i was having these strange sensations in my left arm again and this time occassionally in my left leg, i also felt slightly dizzy. It made me vomit from the fear and i only got to sleep that night at around 3am when i physically could not keep my eyes open any longer. The next day i was having the same symptoms albeit not as bad but this time was experiencing a strange sensation on the left side of my face (tingling/numbness), some low level   and slight blurred vision. After having googled this i was now convinced i was having a  . I went to A&E and they so much as laughed at me - too young to have a stroke. They took my bloods and told me everything was ok, they took my blood pressure and told me it was slightly high and i should contact my GP and i was dismissed as all clear. The next day i saw my GP - he also laughed at me and diagnosed me with Labrynthitis. I believed him to be way out and I should have challenged this at the time but i felt like i should put my faith in him. He prescribed me stemetil and sure enough the   and blurred vision has gone but here i am still having chest pains and sensations in my left arm and occasionally but ever so slightly in my right arm now. I have also now got a bit of upper back 'pain' once again it doesn't hurt but it's evident. The chest pain occurs in the center of my chest, to the left and to the right and if i put pressure on a very specific spot in the centre of my chest there is a slight tenderness. I'm also having what feels like heart palputations or sudden fast heart rate for very short bursts - it's hard to nail as this has never happened before. I've been trying to convince myself of   - but with no symptoms of it ever having occurred previously in my life and the fact that the arm pains came first i am scepticle of this. These symptoms also seem to occur randomly. Funnily enough when i can get to sleep i sleep like a baby and when i wake up for half an hour i feel perfectly normal until all of these symptoms start coming back. Very perculiar. This is where i am at at the moment and i am due to have an ecg, blood test and blood pressure test on wednesday. Can anyone share their thoughts or experiences please!

It subsided for a little while but came back awfully whilst I was eating dinner. It got so bad that my partner called an ambulance as we were worried it was my heart. A paramedic arrived and checked me over, he couldn't hear anything in my lungs and my blood pressure, heart rate and ecg all showed nothing. He asked me to go to the hospital to have   but wasn't overly concerned the next day I went to my GP who sent me for a chest xray. the pain continued on the Friday but I woke up on Saturday and it was gone entirely. I went back to work Saturday, Sunday and Monday all without the pain. Tuesday (yesterday) I woke up at 3am drenched in sweat and the chest pain had come back so violently. I could not breathe in or move without it feeling as though someone was pushing a knife through the centre of my chest. I managed to get myself to work and worked until 9am. I finally gave in and took myself to A&E where my heart was checked again and came back fine. I was told there was a 4 hour wait to see a doctor but I couldn't wait as I had a meeting at work so I stupidly left the hospital. the pain got so intense to the point where I couldn't lift anything up and driving was impossible so I went back to the go who assessed me again. My chest xray had come back clear and the doctor was worried that I had a clot on my lungs so advised I went straight back to A&E which I did. this time I had blood tests for clotting etc, another chest xray and an ecg. I was doubled over in pain and scared to move to make it worse. I was given morphine and codeine for the pain which did not improve it. I was told that all tests were clear and told I could go home. I said I didn't want to go home until I knew what was wrong but I got no answers and was told to wait to see if it subsides. I've woken up today with intense pain, I woke up during the night due to the pain several times and could only sleep flat on my back with my arms across my chest. I have to breathe very shallow and can't move too much as the stabbing pain starts.

It started with ear infections! it was like they never ended and all the ENT would do was clean my ear, give me medicine, and send me on my way. I tried ear tubes and had ear tubes in both ears twice on each side (my right ear is my main issue). and finally I went back with a really really bad ear infection when I was about 16 and cried and asked if there could be something else going on causing these ear infections, He sent me in for some kind of head scan and a pretty good sized Chlosteatoma was found in my ear. I didn't have any symptoms other than my ear infections. They told me it was benign but I would need surgery. I had surgery and they removed the chlosteatoma and I lost a great percentage of my hearing. The tumor had ate away at my hearing bones, my ear drum, and I believe they said I had one hearing bone left. I lost my hearing after the surgery because they called the Chlosteatoma a ""hearing tumor"". Im not exactly sure what that means, but I could still hear when i had the tumor and when they took it out I barley had hearing left in my right ear (only one effected). The surgery i got to remove it wasn't bad. i recovered pretty quickly. The doctor who removed my tumor sent me to a doctor who could rebuild my ear drum and hearing bones. So I went in to this doctor for surgery and he rebuilt my ear drum pretty much successfully. The next step was rebuilding my hearing bones after making sure my ear drum was successful. I was supposed to go in for another surgery but the doctor to do my next surgery who had rebuilt my ear drum had a medical leave and two years passed and by the time the doctor got back to us and told us he wasn't coming back. i was referred to another doctor who rebuilds ears (not many of those) and by the time I got to him he told me there was nothing he could do and basically my ear drum collapsed in. Im not sure if it is because I had ti wait so long for the doctor to tell us he wasn't coming back and if he had not left my ear drum wouldn't collapse, Im not sure. Maybe the surgery wasn't successful as I thought. I could be a number of things. But basically where I am at now is a messed up ear that can't clean itself, I can't get water in it, I have very bad balance issues, and if a gust of wind to strong gets in my ear or water, the world spins!!! My only options is getting a choclear hearing aid. I cannot get a regular hearing aid to go into my ear because no air would get into it and because it already does not clean itself. Therefore the choclear implant (if that is how it is spelled) is my only option. Im only 21 and it is defiantly scary to think about but this is my only option and I just turned in my papers to get ready to schedule a surgery. Im not sure when the surgery will happen but I will update after the surgery as well and how i like the implant. I'm sure others has been left with this option hundreds of surgeries or appointments later but reading up on it, i'm ready to try this out and hopefully be able to hear right without saying ""what"" every sentence and having to read lips.   I have to admit I cried and thought of every situation and thought how did it end up like this. but i believe in the long run, this would be good for anyone in this situation, especially after all options were stressed like mine were.  I hope this has helped someone in the long run and if there are any replies asking questions, id love to answer or help in anyway I can! I'm 21, from wisconsin and have had problems with this for years. I hope this has cleared up some things for some people.  - Haley  0 likes, 2 replies "

I've read about smells, and never able to get wet, and granulation tissue, and constant drainage...none of which sound good at all. But, how many time can I continue to put my poor son through this surgery only to have it recur? I would love to hear your thoughts, personal experiences, and advice.

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/back-to-school-after-cfs-692642,Back to school after cfs,"This morning my 17 year old daughter got on the school bus and went to school for the first time in two years. If you have cfs please do not give up hope.  After failing to recover from a virus my daughter became increasingly unwell.  In the end, she could not read or watch more than half an hour of television, she could not use a computer.  She could not regulate her body temperature or blood pressure well, and sometimes struggled just to string a sentence together.  The list of symptoms was endless. Her school was great, her doctor diagnosed her without hesitation, but there was no help available.  A year and a half into her illness we began working with two therapists and within weeks she had begun to break free from the grip of this horrible illness.  They helped her use the power of her mind to heal her body.  I would NEVER have considered that such a physical illness could respond to mind retraining, but it can.  The two people who helped her were Mel Abbot of Empower therapies Auckland New Zealand, and her associate Pippa Adamson of Newleaf Changes in Bristol UK.   We are forever indebted to  these woman for giving us all our lives back. Do not give up hope. 2 likes, 7 replies "

However, all is not lost — the host for the webinar, Solve ME/CFS Initiative, reposted the entire webinar on YouTube. I forwarded the link to my Neurologist and his associates to give them a better understanding of the science, current research and symptoms. I won't post the link, as I know the mods will remove it — I still don't understand why they do that. If you go to YouTube and enter:   you will be able to view it. I highly, HIGHLY recommend watching it, and sending it to your Doctors to help them understand more clearly the scope of the disease. Dr. Younger gives a presentation of his new research findings that indicate brain inflammation plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of ME/CFS. With pilot funding from SMCI’s Ramsay Award Program, Dr. Younger used a non-invasive imaging technique to measure temperature and other brain chemistry indicators in individuals with ME/CFS and control subjects. The results showed distinctly elevated brain temperature, indicative of inflammation, in patients. The involvement of brain inflammation in the development and progression of ME/CFS has long been an area of interest, but there has been a lack of direct evidence to support the connection. This seminal study further validates that neuroinflammation is occurring in ME/CFS patients and has the potential to point the way to an objective marker and effective medical treatments. 1 like, 35 replies "

I will try to keep it short. (sorry for my english) Symptoms: - I get up in the morning and after about 1-2 hours I get hit by brainfog ( , pressure in my head, feeling heavy, problems to concentrate,feeling low...) and fatigue. Mostly these symptoms get better in the late afternoon. During the evening I feel normal most of the time. The difference between morning/afternoon and evening can be very big. When I go to sleep I feel pretty normal. After a good night of sleep (no sleeping problems) I wake up and the same pattern repeats itself. The severity of the symptoms can vary greatly depending on the period. One week I feel like a zombie all the time and can hardly function, the other week I feel tired but a lot better. I have no idea why. (I have tried to link it with food or sleep or stress but there is no clear correlation). The symptoms have a serious negative impact on my life. In this 6 years I'v tried many things to figure out what is the problem: - Endless  . They where always fine. - Urine tests.  - Sleep study. No problems with sleep. - Cortisol saliva test -   of the blatter and the kindeys - eEg research - CAT scan of the sinuses - EMG research (not sure of the translation) - CEIA bilan (not sure of the translation) - Endless diets: Low-histamine diet, low-sugar diet, no-gluten diet, no-diary diet,... - I tried a lot of supplements (for more then 3 months) but there is nothing that gives me a better feeling. - Psychotherapy  - Allergy test: I am allergic to histamine and mercury - Food intolerance test: this is the only test where they found a potential cause of the symptoms. According to the test i'm intolerant to almond nuts, diary, gluten, yeast, eggs,  and bananas. I avoided these foods for 3 months without any results. Is there somebody out there with similar symptoms? Is there somebody that can give me advice in my search for a better health? How can I get rid of these headaches and the fatigue? Especially the difference between morning/daytime and eventing is very striking. It reminds me of adrenal insufficiency (the symptoms are very similar) but i have tested this and they seem to work normal (blood test and saliva test).  I have no idea why this happens to me. I eat healthy (vegetarian, lots of vegetables, no fast food, a lot of whole foods, not a lot of sugars, not a lot of processed foods,...) and I do sports at least twice a week (only during the evening because during daytime it is difficult). Hope to get some help here! Thanks in advance! Greetings, Sem 0 likes, 12 replies "

Cervical Spondylosis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/risk-of-surgery-vs-living-with-cervical-spinal-stenosis-358591,Risk of surgery vs living with Cervical Spinal Stenosis,"I was diagnosed with cervical spinal stenosis 2 months ago. I have been on a rapid learning curve since and am still seeking answers from the medical profession and fellow sufferers. My story (should you have the patience) goes like this - One year ago I had micro surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome on my right hand under local anaesthetic. It was a miracle cure, with immediate pain relief after surgery pain receded. I still have carpal tunnel on the left hand, but nothing like the pain in my right arm and shoulder that brought me to tears and sleepless nights. So I chose to leave ithe left one be. In November I had a stomach upset, bad enough to go to my GP who adminstered a cocktail of injections to alleviate nausea, sickness, diahorrea and 4 days worth of dehydration. A few minutes afterwards, my mouth was tingling, I felt sick and faint and could not breath. My pulse went from normal 50bpm to 132, oxygen to 72 and bp to 50/30. My veins collapsed, but the GP managed to get me on oxygen, injected cortizone and adrenalin and the IV for fluids was finally insterted in the ambulance en route to the hospital.  I spent the next 4 days in ICU, where I stabilised in the first day. Allergic reaction to the drugs was considered but rejected, as the same drugs were given by IV in hospital. My collapse was diagnosed as hypovolemic shock. Alll organs were checked for damage arising from the oxygen deprivation. Everything was clear but I remained dizzy, unbalanced with moderate headache, so was examined by an orthapaedic specialist who arranged a CT scan of my neck and head. The CT scan revealed spondyloarthritis of the cervical region, discopathie of C5-C6 and C6-7. An MRI followed which revealed C4-C5 disc protrusion and degenrative lesions of joints of Luschka, C5-C6 loss of disc space, herniated disc, bone spurs, C6-C7 same as 5-6, spinal canal compressed to 7.6mm and a hemangioma in vertebral body of C6.  I was referred to a neurosurgeon who had a more detailed MRI done and did physical checks which demonstrated early myeolopathy. It seems this explained my balance and fine motor skill issues and even my carpal tunnel. The surgeon strongly recommended surgery as soon as possible as, whilst delicate and lengthy it was at this stage possible and safe. The alternative would be major adaptations to my very active lifestyle or risk major damage from a minor fall or sudden twist of the neck. Surgery would no longer be an option and I could be paralysed. I researched this and although surprised that other than the carpal tunnel I had no pain, I did indeed suffer from many of the signs of myeolopathy which I had been putting down to growing older (now 56) and general wear and tear of an active body. So surgery was scheduled for early December.  ​ Given the collapse, several checks were made beforehand to ensure I was fit for surgery; ecg, pulmonary function, ecg & ultrasound and discussion with anaesthesiologist. As I have a slight allergy to cats and sometimes use a ventolin inhaler, I was put on a cortisone inhaler and was to be given a nebuliser along with the pre med. The anesthetic team would monitor me after GA was adminstered to ensure I was stable before surgery commenced. I would be kept under GA for 24 hours to allow my windpipe to recover from swelling to ensure I resumed breathing easliy.  I was brought round c24 hours after entering theatre to find myself in the coma ward with all the consultants around me. It seems that depsite all the precautions and 30 mins monitoring after GA, the surgeon was about to make the incision when I went into bronchiospasm. I am told my blood pressure dropped to dangerously low but my heart kept trying. I suffered a minor cardio infraction, my lungs filled and oxygen fell to near zero. I am not yet sure how they saved me from this situation, but thankfully I am here to tell the tale. Needless to say, surgery was aborted and I spent the 24 hours on a ventilator until they brought me round. The next 4 days in ICU were a slow, hard and shocking recovery both physically and emotionally. Lungs and heart were constantly monitored. I had 2 quite different skin reactions that were attended to by pulmonarist checking for DVT and dermatologist treating and trying to ascertain cause. One reaction was tears on my inner forearm that had white crusty edges. The one on my inner calf started with bruising and developed into large blisters after 3 days. The consensus was massive allergic reaction, most likely linked to the first collapse. I was sent home to recover over the holiday season. By force majeur I am no longer leading an active life, but to minimise risk to my spinal cord I still have to wear a protective collar when out, am not to drive, nor exercise (I usually jog) and must take care while walking or on stairs. Despite the trauma and in the case of the heart some minor irreparable damage, my pulmonary function test and stress ecg showed a return to pre theatre levels - even better in the case of the lungs. Steroid meds stopped and allergy tests were run last week. It seems that two of the drugs given at the first collapse were not in fact given again in the first hospital. One of these drugs was also in the GA mix, so it was a primary suspect as an allergen trigger. Allergy testing was conducted last week. Such is the concern of the consulting team that even the subcutaneous skin tests were run in ICU, linked up to IV and all monitors. However, even an undiluted sample of the suspected trigger did not give a clear, positive result. A Rheumatologust was called in to discuss the possibility of an auto immune disease, butblood tests for these have returned negative. Biopsies were taken in each of the areas of skin damage. By now my arm had healed although scarred. The blisters on my calf burst after the three weeks and now, 6 weeks later are black, dented areas surrounded by red, taught skin. The dermatologist advises this is necrosis and it is to be removed this week to give the good underlying skin a chance to heal. Next steps are to review the biopsy results and then have a team meeting of all concerned to review findings and ongoing risk of any future medical intervention. Whatever the trigger or cause, it is certainly life threatening and at this time, the best I can hope for is that there is a way of managing the risk. So in the coming weeks I have to decide if the neck surgery is worth that risk. I find myself much less informed about what living with this neck condition is like. What degenration can I expect, over what timescale? I have relatively no pain, does that mean it is yet to come, the carpal tunnel was indeed related or a coincidence? I drop things, bump into things, feel disconnected a lot - are these related and will get worse? WIll they get better if I have the op? What other treatments are out there? Is my surgeon's advice to have this surgery now while it is simple and safe still valid, given my as yet undiagnosed allergic condition? I see many people here living with this neck condition in varying degrees. I would appreciate any personal views and links to information that are considered useful. This would help build my understanding and coming to a decision.

I’ve been depressed for a month now,I underwent different treatments with different doctors and I was assured my cellulitis will be gone.I developed trauma of my left leg after the accident.I didn’t realize it was really serious because usually when I have bruise it will just disappear after few days.But I was alarmed when I felt heaviness on my left leg,and it’s swollen and inflamed too and painful.I went to an orthopedic Doctor,had an x-ray,it’s normal,and ultrasound revealed tissue swelling.I’m relieved because there’s no need for draining,no collection of pus and fluid inside.I was on 10 days oral antibiotic treatment of clindamycin and ciprofloxacin and NSAID too.After 5 days,It became better and I was happy but then when I went back to work,persistent walking aggravates the pain and I was depresses when I removed my sock,my ankle is swollen.I’ve finished the full course of antibiotics with the first doctor but still my leg is not recovered.It kept coming back. I went to a surgeon,dermatologist and internist for another opinion.Last Doctor just prescribed me antibacterial ointment and topical NSAID and vitamins.I am now on calcium,vitamin D and Neurobion vitamins.I can feel that it’s becoming better but my worries is the color of my leg is still bad and  the nature of my job can delay my recovery. Guys,do I really need more rest  to get rid from this?Should I stop working?

I was hoping someone would have found a solution to this being a cause... after suffering two bouts of insect bite induced cellulitis, both which effectively put paid to summer for me, one incident meant I was hospitalised and on a drip for two days followed by 10 days of twice daily visits by nurses to administer intravenous anti-biotics plus recovery time afterwards, the other last year, required frequent visits by GP's to drain the horrendous giant yellow blisters that occur through this infection - and again I was off work for 5 weeks at the height of summer and more importantly missed out on booked holidays to boot, I was really hoping someone had found a solution to be being infected in the first place!   If anyone has suffered cellulitis as a result of insect bite and has found a way of preventing this, please let me know!  Now that summer is almost here I don't intend to sunbathe in my garden, or even go in my garden without wearing long trousers and mosquito repellent as a back up.  It really spoils summer for me now as cellulitis is so painful it's frightening.  I'd do anything not to get it again! Also, does anyone suffer problems with the place where the blisters have been?  I seem to suffer frequent itching and soreness on the patch where the blisters have been and wonder if this means there's underlying infection there?   Being someone who looks after themselves, is fit and active and tries to keep healthy, I find this condition really difficult to cope with, I get very distressed as when I've first been infected and the pain is at it's worst I have to get friends to stay with me to look after me as I can't even get to the bathroom unaided, it's so painful, even childbirth wasn't as bad, at least that ended after a relatively short time... this goes on for days and days and days!  And no sleep! And I agree with the lady from Spain, doctors here don't zap it with the right strength of anti-biotics if you get it really badly, that's why i ended up in hospital the first time - if I get it again I'm going to insist on the double dose of different anti-biotics they have ended up using both times as single dose of one anti-biotic did absolutely nothing and meant that it got much worse than it needed to have been. Apologies if none of this helps anyone, but it makes me feel a lot better to know that others have suffered as I have as no-one else I know has had this, and doesn't know how bad it is   [i:50fff95a39]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:50fff95a39] 5 likes, 75 replies "

After a couple of weeks I started treating it with over the counter antifungal creams and sprays to no avail . Well 11 nights ago I got caught out on my motorcycle in the rain and was fairly close to a friends house so I went there rather than trying to wait it out and make it home . This turned out to be a HUGE MISTAKE !!!!!  I say that because I ended up sleeping in my wet clothes because he had nothing that would even come close to fitting me and it was already nearly midnight . The next day my dry itchy patch had transformed into an entirely new species ! It was now severely swollen , burning like hot coals and seaping puss from several areas so bad that it was seeping through my underwear and jeans . After a week of dealing with these new symptoms with triple antibiotic ointment , I awoke that morning with the muscles in both arms hurting so I decided that I had better go to the Emergency Room because it was my belief that whatever it was was spreading throughout my body now . I choose to go to Vanderbilt Medical Center because of their reputation . I was scared that I had contracted MRSA ""at least I believe that's the way it's abbreviated"" . Well I had to go to the pharmacy that morning anyway so I began describing what had been happening with me to my Pharmacist and showed it to him . He said that it looked like Shingles . Now I'm really freaking out because at this point I'm 99% sure that it's one or the other and neither one has a happy ending . So I finally get my nerve up enough to go to the hospital and after sitting for hours in the waiting room to be seen , they called my name to take my vitals . I began telling the nurse my story and in just a minute after being sent back to the waiting room for what I expected to be hours more , the nurse come and got me and said to come with her . I said wow that was a lot faster than I expected and she said yep you said the magic word . I replied what's that ? She said Shingles ! Here put this mask on and come with me . I asked why I needed a mask and she said because it's VERY CONTAGIOUS ! So they decided to admit me and started an IV drip of a wide spectrum of antibiotics and didn't stop for three days . Well in the meantime they were neglecting to give me my pain medication that I normally take , not to mention anything extra for what they diagnosed as Cellulitis the second day that I was there . After three days of asking everyone that came in my room about my pain medication , I finally got one Doctor to agree to give me something for my pain yesterday morning . Well the nurse brought me 15mg of Oxycodone and some tums for my heartburn and was supposed to bring me some oxycottin about an hour later . That would have been around 10:15 AM . At 6:00 PM I still haven't gotten my oxycottin . Now I'm getting mad . I called the nurse via the call button on the remote for everything in the room and asked why I still haven't gotten my medicine and she told me that I had . I replied , no maam I haven't . You brought me the Oxycodone and two Tums but never came back with the Oxycottin . She insisted that she had because she had scanned my armband to prove it so there was no way that she could fourge that ! I replied that the only thing that proves is that you scanned the bracelet , not that I ever received the pill . I said to her , look it's like this. Either someone brings me my pain medication in the next 15 minutes or my discharge papers ! Needless to say that I'm writing this from my living room this morning because that junkie nurse stole my medication therefore couldn't get me my medication without getting herself in hot water . I'm now waiting for Urgent Care to open so that I can go get a prescription for some Penicillin or whatever they give you for Cellulitis .

Cellulitis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/lingering-discomfort-after-completing-medications-663845,Lingering discomfort after completing medications,"So i was diagnosed with cellulitis on 6/4/2018 doctor prescribed me 2 different antibiotics and naproxen. Prescription  was for 10 days. I completed my medication except for naproxen since it was only pain killers. After the 10th day, the pain was tolerable but still noticed discomfort around metatarsal bone which is behind the big toe. So i figured it was still healing. Then days later i noticed the skin started to peal while discomfort started to be more mild. Now its been about 5 days after i finished the antibiotics im experiencing discomfort just slight more aggressive but tolerable, but it feels like a pinch muscle or nerve. Cant really bend my big toe when walking, only if i manually bend it. I notice couple days before if i stepped in a certain way, there would be a like slight numbness. The skin around the metatarsal is almost to normal skin color i do noticed there is still a slight blackish/purpleish color exactly on the side of the metatarsal bone, not as dark as it was before. Can it just be nerves/muscles repairing itself? I know they say it takes 10 days to clear off cellulitis after you started your treatment but how long does it takes it be back feeling normal? Please help.  0 likes, 6 replies "

Still dealing with chronic upper back and neck pain, now seven months after surgery for Cauda Equina Syndrome. In February I saw my surgeon and a physiatrist. They both believe that my ongoing back pain is due to the nerve damage in my left leg and hip and in particular, my glute muscle. This muscle (in the buttock) helps stabilize when I walk and because it is weak I am recruiting other back muscles to do the job. It is also a very large muscle and would take the longest to recover from nerve damage (if it recovers 😡 . That is the theory they are going with, anyway. I'm not entirely convinced. The explanation makes more sense with the ongoing lower back pain, but I don't understand why my neck and upper back have also been stiff and sore off and on for five months now (the neck pain actually started when I was still an outpatient in physio back in October 2017...the physiotherapist gave me some stretches back then and it went away until December 2017). I am interested in what the MRI shows, but I have to wait until mid-April for that. Again, I really appreciate people's feedback. There is so little information out there about how CAS people do post-surgery. Even the physiatrist here in Vancouver (a city of over a million) had only seen a couple of CAS patients. I could write a whole other post on how frustrating it has been to get doctors to take seriously my continuing back pain and another post on trying to get sone income support from the government.

Cauda Equina Syndrome,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-ces-story-1-week-in-552233,My CES Story - 1 week in ,"Hi my name is Adam, 34 years old, and have been healthy, fit and strong for all of my life, never broke a bone or had surgery. My career is going great and I've been married to the most amazing women for over 4 years who gave birth to our first child, a beautiful baby boy on 18th November. For the past 8 months or so I've had sciatica, which I assumed was from running or the seating position of a new car. Stretching always relived the pain and I thought nothing more of it as it was easily bearable and only impacted me when sitting for long periods. Due to the constant bending to pic up my baby boy, I developed a pain in same area of my sciatica, nothing extreme, just a typical back strain and was struggling to get a full gait with my left leg. As I was on paternity, on November 28th I decided to see an osteopath to finally sort the issue out, as having a new born was certainly not going to help. The treatment seemed ok and I walked out slightly less stiff.  The next day I was ok, similar pain when walking but a bit tender around the massaged area. That evening I had a bit of a spasm in my back where the pain was when bending over using the toilet, but once I was up I was fine and thought nothing more.  The following morning I was struggling to get out of bed, I got 3 steps down the stairs and the spasm hit again, but 10 times worse. No way was I making it down stairs then. I made it back to bed to releave the pain. This went on at intervals throughout the day, trying to go the bathroom etc, and at one point I made it down the stairs (no spasm) and back up. I could only stand for short period (30 secs), but as soon as I was back lying down I was fine. Since it was a bad back I was trying move every hour to not seize. 5pm, I couldn't even try to get out of bed without feeling the spasm and pain.  6pm came and I could get out of bed no problem, pain but no spasm.  I went to the toilet at 7pm and started to go. Standing still was extremely painful and then the spasm came, worse than ever. I stopped and headed straight for the bed to get flat. I managed to get on the bed and get flat and then everything started to go numb from my waist down. My feet were locked, my legs had little movement and my groin and butting area went all numb. As like most, I've never heard of CES, and hadn't got a clue what was happening. I instantly knew something was wrong and dailed for an ambulance.  2 hours later I was in A&E, where a doctor had recognised my symptoms after waiting 2 hours in the queue. By 3am I had been ambulanced to a specialist spinal unit, still unable to move my feet/ankles and still the numbness in my groin and buttock area. An MRI detected a L4-L5 disc hernation. I had surgery at 1pm that day, 18 hours after the initial onset. Having read more about CES and the crucial window to avoid lasting damage, I feel very lucky to have had surgery so quick, and even more so to get moved to a rehab centre within a few days.  I'm now recovering in a Spinal Rehabilitation unit, 8 days after surgery. My legs are moving, bending at the knee (but not in a scissor motion), and both feet have drop foot.  The numbness to my groin and buttock area remains. Since the surgery the movement in my feet has increased, I can wiggle them maybe 5mm, and the numbness may have decreased slightly on the outside of my buttock region and a bit in my groin, but a great deal remains. I can't voluntarily urinate, but can tell I need to go. I have some feeling in my bowel function but no proper control.  I can stand and walk awkwardly taking small steps with a frame which is extremely tiring. I'm working on building the strength back in to my legs, but toilet troubles have halted that progress. I'm trying to stay positive and have my family and friends to support me, but as I'm sure you can imagine, missing out on those precious moments of a new born is hurting, but at the same time motivating me to become stronger without overdoing it. Over the last week or so I have researched everything I can on CES and read countless stories, and realise I am lucky to have some movement and to have received surgery in a timely manner.  I am still in the early days and see months of hard work ahead to try and function more independently. I just wanted to put my story out there and would appreciate any advice.

I was given my first ESI that same day, the pain increased for a few days, then I was better for a few weeks where the pain was tolerable. About a month later, I had an even worse flare, had to go have another ESI the same day I called my doctor. Pain increased worse that go around, had to be put on a steroid,  and after a week and half it was semi-bearable.  The pain will be incredible in my lower back, shoot up my back, around my ribs, down into my hips, into my thighs and calves, my neck stiffens and I get terrible tension headaches. All of this is ALWAYS worse on the left side of my body. I'm on day seven of this now, although all last week I was hurting, not badly, but I felt it coming. I've barely slept all week and when I do it is unrestful because the pain and or spasms wake me up. I'm also having a new pain that feels like spasms in my rectum and that's getting more intense. I went to the ER yesterday and happy to say my anal sphincter is working well and the reflexes in my legs are still okay, even the left one that I feel like is going to give out anytime. However, they did go ahead and do an MRI just to make sure nothing else has changed since my MRI at my spine doctor like 3 months ago. Surprisingly I now have a herniation at L5-S1 and it is pinching a nerve in addition to L4-L5 herniation and severe DDD that my neurologist already knew about and was treating me for. I feel somewhat relieved in the fact that they didn't diagnose me with Cauda Equina, but did tell me I'd have to pay close attention to any changes. I have only urinated twice today even though I have been drinking alot and I usually got 6-8 times a day, I usually cannot tolerate even the smallest about of urine on my bladder. Just recently when I got out of bed the back of my left thighs and my left knee felt numb. I'm worried they didn't take me seriously because my anal sphincter was still working and I still had reflexes on my knees on my left leg, which I can barely lift, those were the only two physical examinations they gave me yesterday. In addition to that I do not currently have insurance so I'm worried they are putting me off, I don't want it to get it a point where I have permanent nerve damage. 0 likes, 13 replies "

Cauda Equina Syndrome,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/cauda-equina-and-muscle-spasms-650639,Cauda equina and muscle spasms ,"Hi guys just wanted to share my story with you all. Around 3 years ago I developed severe lower back pain that was the result of a manual lifting job I had at the time. Over a year the symptoms got worse and caused severe nerve pain in my right leg which my GP diagnosed as sciatica. I was at my gp most months asking for stronger pain meds as the pain was nearly unbearable. Around 2 years ago I remember it was a Friday and I made an emergency appointment to see my GP as the pain was so bad and I was struggling to walk more than a few meters at a time without stopping. At my appointment my GP didn’t examine me although I told him that I had a strange feeling in my testicles and they felt numb. He said he would give me stronger pain meds and refer me to the hospital to get a mri scan but the wait would be a few months.  The next morning I awoke to find that my legs, feet, anus, penis and testicles were all numb. Not knowing much about medical conditions I tried to carry on as normal until I mentioned my symptoms to my brother who is a paramedic. He told me that my symptoms were very serious and that it sounded like QE. This was the first time I had heard of it. My parents picked me up and rushed me to the Hospital. Within an hour I had had an MRI scan and the doctor confirmed Qauda Equina syndrome. I was told that I would need emergency surgery there and then and was put into an ambulance and rushed to Cardiff hospital where the a surgeon was waiting to do the surgery. The surgery took 3 hours and I remember waking up very sore but the extreme nerve pain had gone. I stayed in hospital nearly 10 days as I was retaining urine so eventually left with catheters so that I could relieve myself.  After leaving hospital I found myself walking with a limp which I worked hard to try and stop. I had no bowel problems but would self catheter 3 times a day to stop any UTI’s occurring.  Other than the normally lower back pain the nerve pain had gone.  It’s roughly two years now since my operation and I now have most of the feeling back in my saddle area and no longer need to use a catheter. I can also get a normal erection and ejaculate normally. My limp has gone although I still find myself limping when I’m tired as I have slight foot drop in my left foot.  My biggest concerns at present are the muscle wastage in my left calf and foot. The instep of my left foot has gone very high and my foot looks withered? I have also developed severe muscle cramps in both calf’s and feet especially at night? My feet and toes will contorted and the pain is unreal. I often have to dive out of bed. Has anyone else experienced this? I was just wondering if this is a normal symptom after cauda equina? And if there is any medication that could help?  I forgot to say that I was 33 having the surgery and I’m now 35. I do feel very lucky as I know that there are a lot of people that don’t make such good recoveries. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciative Thanks Matt 1 like, 7 replies "

At the begging of April I was helping do some yard work and a rather large tree limb knocked me to the ground.  Everyone there said they thought it had killed me because I hit the ground so hard.  Really not thinking I got up brushed myself off and went about the rest of the day.  Granted no one would let me do anything but I kinda just put it out of my mind.   Three days later I woke up quite sore.  On my way to the bathroom that morning that all too fimliar ""boiling water on the back of my leg"" sensision brought tears to my eyes. I laid around for the next couple days taking it easy hoping it would just go away.  When I started feeling a weird numbness in new places I contacted my GP who told me in no uncertain terms to go back to my spinal  nero surgan.  who promply sent me for the soonest MRI I could get.  (After insurance approval that is)   The reason I'm here is because he told me he was about 90% sure I had blown another disc from the amount of weakness in my leg, And the numbness and tingling in my ummmm my ummmm well between my legs and on my butt.  I have also been having a couple other symptoms which he couldn't rule out being ces with out a MRI.   I'm wondering if anyone could help me some because I can't find any info on this thing.  it's like all the sites say the exact same thing and are no help.  My MD told me if I used the bathroom on myself or when 24 hours without using the bathrrom or lost all feeling in my leg to go straight to my local hospital (very small town ER) and tell them my surgan was out of the next town and have them take me by ems there.   Here are my questions for those of you who may have had it. Has anyone ever not had the earge to pee until it was almost too late?  ( I won't have to pee and then instead of that little twinge that says you gotta go I feel like I'm on one of those old inccontance commericals ""gotta go gotta go gotta go right now""  and I feel like I""m not gonna make it to the bathroom in time) What do they mean by it can cause  ?  (I have been pretty regular for the last year.  even thought I""m on an array of meds I take a stool softner ever day to keep me regular but the last month it's like I'm only going like once a week if I""m lucky but it feels like I have to poop 85% of the time.  but I cant push anything out.) What about nthe need to pee in the middle of the night? (I used to never get up now I wake up with the urge to pee and almost fall going to the bathroom because I have to rush so fast after just opening my eyes) I have't read anything about the next couple.  Has anyone experinced  ?  (Like the worst case of poison oak with flea bites and misquito bites you have ever felt.  I have clawed the crap out of my leg and foot to the point I have broken the skin and look like I have some sort of desise or something.  It's not bites and itch cream doesn't help at all.) And lastly has anyone ever experienced nausua or palpations?  (I'm really thinking that one is stress and my nerves because of this but I don't know for sure)  Any tips thoughts ideas anything will be greatly appreciated I'm scared and at my wits end.  along with the pain and strange feelings.  I'm loosing it. bad over here . 0 likes, 2 replies "

Diarrhoea is very atypical of gastric bypass recipients who tend to experience constipation. I eliminated everything from my diet that could possibly cause it due to malabsorption of fat and sugar. Thinking that maybe stress was causing it I was put on diazepam. Didn't work. Immodium does not make any difference at all. I didn't even think that maybe my spine was in trouble again until the incontinence. And then I remembered a few attacks of sciatica which I haven't had in years following the lumbar laminectomy.

On the whole I have made pretty good progress I think. I have always had some saddle numbness on the right side and some down the right calf area and the right foot. This improved for a few weeks or so after the operation but would say it has settled down now and been the same for about 1 year.  My question is surrounding this particular area. Does anyone else that suffers with the same numbness and loss of feeling have periods of a few days where it feels a bit worse than what is normal for you? Over the past 3,4 days, and this has happened once or twice before I think over the past 12 months, my saddle area just feels a bit 'heavier' - like a bit extra numbness has spread a bit more. Does anyone else have these same changes? Is it normal? I am not unduly concerned currently and would add I am in no pain or showing any kind of symptons of any back pain etc and do expect the feeling to go down again. The difference is so minimal but just wondered if anyone else has any similar changes? Any advice or input appreciated. Regards David 1 like, 3 replies "

No one could ever tell me with both cauda equina and the disc issues if I'd improve or be worse with my pregnancy , from the begining  i had asked alot of questions but all that was said is it could go either way there was no definite answer.  I fortunalty havent lost any bladder / bowel function but In  these last 2 - 2 1/2months of my pregnancy have been the worse with the discs and cauda equina issues especially in bad weather.  And last of all  Does anyone know  how each case is handled, what if any meds are given especially if you haven't had surgery yet and want to do another vaginal birth if its even possible ????  0 likes, 9 replies "
Cauda Equina Syndrome,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/getting-bowels-under-control-after-ces-680686,Getting bowels under control after ces,"I had surgery mid July 2018 for ces. As far as i can tell, it went well. Ive got the numbness in my legs and i think things are getting better there. But like many with ces, i dont have control of my bladder and bowels. bladder I can deal with a lot easier. But my bowels are the problem. I am having a constant sensation of needing to poop. But when i actually have a seat on the toilet, nothing comes out. I often times go 3-4 days without having a bowel movement. Despite eating full meals throughout this time. when i do finally go, its due to a combination of a couple things... i usually go after i convince a friend to give me an enema. And then, i still only go if i sit on the toilet and gag myself as if I’m trying to make myself vomit. I guess the pressure of vomiting pushes things along as well. Keep in mind that I’m not actually vomiting. Just going through the gagging motions. I usually do this on an empty stomach. It ain’t pretty. And I ain’t proud of this. But a man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do... i take Lactulose every once in a while. But that only helps me poop a very little tiny bit. And not an actual full bowel movement.  Every time i have a bowel movement, i think it’s solid, and possibly hard. When i was in the hospital and rehab center, my stool was pasty and runny. I was eating pretty bad at the hospital. But  because my stool was runny and pasty, it would always come out whenever i would stand up and exert myself as in stairs or standing/sitting repeatedly. as a result of this, i am considering switching to a liquid diet altogether. This would be a big undertaking for me. And i wanted to know if anyone had any other suggestions on how to get bowels under control before i pull the trigger on a liquid diet. evryone Around me seems to think they’re an expert on how to get me to poop. Drink this. Eat more of this. What these people seem to forget is that, these hoodoo voodoo tricks they have are for people with functioning bowels.  I dont want to end up pooping From my side in to a bag. 0 likes, 3 replies "

Cauda Equina Syndrome,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/recovery-from-cauda-equina-syndrome-399933,Recovery from Cauda Equina Syndrome,"I wanted to share a story of my boyfriends experience with CES because I had never heard of it until he was diagnosed, I searched for information on how he might recover and read so many traumatic stories I was devasted.  I could not find any positive outcomes. For people who might be newly learning of this condition let me share a beacon of hope when you are likely feeling quite terrified! My boyfriend had back problems for many years, I think prolapsed discs that eventually healed themselves.  Last year he had this condition for much longer than normal, a number of months and the pain got worse and worse.  He was getting shooting pains down the backs of his legs.  One weekend he said his legs were starting to feel numb and then in the space of 2 days he lost feeling in his feet and calves.  He could not feel any sensation as to whether his bladder or bowels were full and he couldn't feel his buttocks at all.  His penis also completely lost all feeling. At this point he went to hospital and fortunately was in a hospital with an excellent neurosurgery unit so they recognised the symptoms immediately.  The surgeon operated within hours removing the disc.  He was in hospital a couple of days for recovery from surgery but almost immediately the feeling in his bladder and bowels returned. Once back home he was very, very weak for several weeks, really struggling to walk.  He had numb legs for a long time and even now, 8 months later, he still cannot feel the base of one foot.  For many weeks after surgery the feeling in his buttocks and penis did not return.  As you can imagine we were both very worried this could be a permanent situation.  After a few weeks he managed to get an erection and ejaculate even though he couldn't actually feel it.  Finally after many weeks the feeling in the saddle area fully returned and all was functioning as normal. He had a very severe limp even until now and sadly that has resulted in a second prolapsed disc which he will also need surgery for but thankfully the disc is not compressing the nerves that would cause CES and the surgeon is confident he will heal nicely.   So he isn't yet recovered from all the issues related to his back but I think he has almost fully recovered from the specific issues associated with CES and the compression of that specific nerve system.   I hope this gives people some hope that it is possible to recover in some situations. 9 likes, 75 replies "

Cauda Equina Syndrome,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-experience-of-cauda-equina-syndrome-35773,My experience of Cauda Equina Syndrome,"I thought I'd post about my experience of Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES) in case it's of any use to anyone. I'm a 30-year-old woman.  In spring 2010 my lower back suddenly became painful. It didn't get better. Over the summer I tried various things - painkillers, the chiropractor, the gym, swimming, pilates - but found nothing gave lasting relief. Towards the year end my back became increasingly stiff and sore and one evening before Christmas I fell on the snow and felt a disc slip in my back.  Instantly I was in agony. The doctor seemed to think my level of pain was pretty standard and put me on Voltarol. I carried on with work with out pain but feeling electric shock sensations down my legs every so often. When I came off the Voltarol a week later, I had the most excruciating sciatica and was almost crawling up the walls with pain. I was put back on painkillers and told repeatedly by several very kind, but essentially uninterested doctors that the sciatica would likely wear off. After about 3 weeks I had upped my dosage of painkillers (dangerously, I later found out) to cope with the pain. My GP told me that no investigation of sciatica was warranted until I had had it for at least 6 weeks. After 4 weeks I started to have difficulty walking. After about 50 yards I would need to crouch down to get the feeling back in my legs so I could continue moving. My feet would point in odd directions sometimes, as if I had a disability. When I lay down, a feeling of coldness would fill my bottom area. I experienced some difficulty in peeing though I was still able to go to the toilet and had no incontinence until the day of the operation.  I called the doctor after a week of this and he said if I wasn't incontinent, there was no need to worry about CES. I later learnt that once you are incontinent with CES, your prognosis for recovering nerve function is significantly worse. I was in the pre-stages of urinary retention, which he didn't seem to think was at all related. He said the leg weakness was most likely muscle wasting from the sciatica (which I thought odd - my muscles looked and were behaving perfectly normally) and that if I felt coldness, not pins and needles in my saddle area, it did not sound like CES (which I'd heard about after typing my symptoms into Google and finding that unanimously, they came up).  A week later I got another doctor's appointment as my leg weakness and inability to pee were getting worse. This time I saw a different doctor who instantly realised what the problem was, tested the sensation in my saddle area which was worryingly absent (it's horribly easy not to notice that bits of you are going numb) and sent me straight to A&E. After various tests and an MRI I was diagnosed with CES with a very large disc herniation at L4-L5 and was operated on that night.  After the surgery the leg pain and weakness resolved instantly. When the nurses removed my catheter though I couldn't pee and couldn't feel anything much in my genital area. I was utterly terrified that I might have ruined my sex life and lost the ability to pee normally. They sent me home with a tap catheter to try and remind my body of what it should be doing.  A couple of weeks later I was lying in bed and suddenly felt a wave of feeling in my saddle area, as if all my nerve endings were suddenly alert. It was the most wonderful feeling as I knew it meant that my nerves were repairing and that I hadn't lost sensation here. I could feel that I needed to pee, which was also wonderful. The catheter came out soon after and I could pee normally most of the time, with a slight delay at other times.  It's now a year later. I'm often in pain with my back still. I've had several episodes where CES symptoms have come back and I've been MRIed again, showing that whenever any disc of mine in that area slightly bulges out, the nerves damaged by the first herniation go on the blink again, but with time the numbness goes away again, though it's always nerve-wracking. I pee normally most of the time but am still seeing a neuro-urologist at times to assist with this. I've currently got sciatica for the first time since prior my operation which is worrying, but I'm keeping an eye on it and will contact my brilliant consultant if it doesn't go away after a month or so, or obviously if I develop any more worrying symptoms.   The point of this essay is really to explain what happened to me, as when I got the syndrome I couldn't find details of another case quite like mine online. I hope this might be helpful to someone who is worried their nerves won't repair, because there is often hope that they will - when I was in hospital, the doctors kept telling me my nerves wouldn't get better as I had had pressure on them for longer than 48 hours - in fact 3 weeks! But they still did, so there is hope.  The other point of this story is that I needn't have ever developed this distressing syndrome had my back problems been taken seriously by my GPs. The other day I went back to the GP to get their advice about this new episode of sciatica and they said ""Let's wait and see how it turns out."" I think in this instance they're probably right - it probably will wear off with painkillers and physiotherapy. But this is exactly the same advice they gave me a year ago prior to my operation. If my GP had ordered a scan after my disc first slipped, or after my sciatica first started, my consultant says they would have straight away seen that I would need surgery as the herniation was too big to ever repair by itself. But they didn't think it was a big deal, and I don't like to be pushy.  And as a result of their inattention and delay I developed CES and now have permanent nerve damage.  I understand that back pain is a fact of life for many, and it looks like I'm going to be one of them. I also understand that in the vast majority of cases, slipped discs and sciatica go away by themselves. But it seems to me that whenever there is the chance of some underlying pathology that will lead to outcomes like (or worse than) mine, GPs should err vastly on the side of caution. 27 likes, 319 replies "

Now nearly 12 months post operation, and have re-gained full bladder, bowel and sexual function. Live 85-90% normal life, only exception is some nerve damage down right leg which means I can no longer jog/run (As can't push off my calf normally). But can walk fine, which is main thing.

I asked them to drag me out on a sheet and then  down the stairs on the streatcher ? They said no. They picked me up to sit me on a chair with wheels on it. I felt my back going into the most pain I had ever felt. I almost passed out. Then they put me in a different chair that went down stairs. Then was moved to the stretcher. Was given morphine for pain. At the ER the surgeon knew I had CES and needed imeadiate surgery. I was left with not feeling from waist down. Spent 6 wks in rehibiliation hospital.

Cervical Rib Syndrome,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/first-rib-resection-understanding-side-effects-after-surgery-505876,First Rib Resection - understanding side effects after surgery,"In October 2015, I underwent a first rib resection after being diagnosed with Venous Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (Subclavian Compression v. Nueral Compression). My case was fairly urgent as the blood flow was limited to roughly 10% thru my subclavian vein. I was very lucky as I did not experience any typical symptoms such as a swollen arm due to clotting. I originally went to the doctors because I had a pain in my lower abdomin, which I thought was   coming on. I tested positive for D-Dimer (results around 2.0+), therefore my doctor immediately sent to get a   to rule out a blood clot. I did not have a blood clot, but this is when they did discover the unusually narrow vein. The doctor advised I see a Thoracic specialist.  The surgery went well. I was in the hospital for 2 nights. Recovery took about 4-6 weeks before I could go back to work full-time. I underwent PT for about 2 months, starting 1 month after surgery.  However, since October I have experienced a number of side effects including: 1. Horner's Syndrome. My right pupil (side of surgery) is still noticably constricted.  2. Numb arm due to damage of the long thoracic nerve, a constant roller coaster of sharp, acute pain and soreness near my right breast bone (I had my right first rib taken out). I want to understand if the pains I am feeling 6 months later are a normal part of nerve regeneration and if anyone has a similar experience, how long they last? The pain seems to come on and off all day. Some pains (acute/shooting) mainly in the mid-section of my right arm. The under side of my arm is still numb to touch. 3. Another pain I experience is near my second rib, where it attachs to the breastbone. A lower position then where my first rib was taken out, so I find this strange, the irriation would be lasting this long. 4. About 2 months ago, I started getting sharp pains in my upper lung (is the best way to describe it). When I drink cold water or other beverages it sends a sharp pain to the area. It is very strange. 5. Stuffy nose at night. Since surgery I can not breathe through my nose fully. It feels stuffy and not clear.  I have been to a few typical follow up appointments but my surgeon has not been able to identify a detailed reason for these pains besides a side effect of surgery. I understand my body underwent an intrusive surgery and needs time to heal, but I often get worried now something else is wrong, since the pains come on so suddenly and sharp, six months later.  We do not know the reason for the development of the VTOS. One of my surgeons suggested it happened when I was young, as the network of blood vessels around the vein were enlarged and carried much of the blood not flowing through my subclavian vein.

My symptoms started over 3 yrs ago with the sudden onset of severe debilitating neck/headaches making everyday living very difficult. As I drove for a living a was finding it very difficult to cope with the pain as over the counter treatments were no good. The pain starts in the neck / back of the head region and radiates up the back of the head and into my facial area around the eyes, every slight movement of my head or neck resulted in severe pain and the only way to alleviate this was to lay down and rest or sleep the headaches last anywhere from 2 hrs to all day.  My other symptoms are pain in the neck between my shoulders , pain in my shoulders running down my arms into my hands causing constant numbness tingling and stiff painfull little, ring and index fingers and also my thumb. Holding my arm in 1 position  for any length ( on the phone , driving, computer )causes severe burning pain in my forearm and hand. Eventually sent for xrays and mri scan which shows I have cervical spondylosis.  I've been on gabapentin and amytriptyline now for 9 months and have suffered badly with side effects and reactions ( dizzy spells, confusion, memory loss, depression, hallucinations the list is endless) . I have seen the neurosurgeon 4 times now over the last 3 yrs , who originally told me to leave it for 6 months as it may get better on it's own , to then saying have further tests then we will consider surgery to now saying he's sending me for physio and pain management.  Totally Fed up and confused how he has contradicted himself with the treatment continually and seems to dismiss it all as trivial and ultimately gives me no real answers or hope. I have been off work now for the last 6 months as the headaches arm pain , hand numbness and tingling coupled with the loss of arm and hand strength meant driving was becoming dangerous as I couldn't move my head or neck for the pain . He has refused surgery as he says he does not feel I would benefit as it could make matters worse.

Firstly it is very important to get the correct diagnosis, don't be messed around by your GP as I was initially, if you are worried about your condition ask your GP to send you for a MRI. It was 2012 when I had my surgery ACDF [with internal plates & screws to stabilise my neck] following my MRI scan I saw an Orthopaedic Surgeon who told me I needed  surgery he proposed a laminectomy, I was doubtful about this procedure & the fact this was not a Neurosurgeon, I asked for 2nd opinion & I then saw a Neurosurgeon, he told me that I needed a different procedure, but for some reason I did not like this consultant & his arrogant attitude, so one pondering I remember a friend who had successful spinal surgery a few years previously & I remembered the surgeons name, so I decided to phone his secretary [long story short] I had a 3rd opinion with this neurosurgeon & he straight away told me ""its a good job you have come to see me"", he went on to say if you had had either of the previous proposed procedures you would have finished up worse off than you now, I was totally shocked, he told me I needed a far more complex procedure which involved removing a spur also fusion on 3 vertebra & a plate & screws to support the rest of my badly worn vertebra..i went onto have this surgery & recovered very quickly, this was over 5 years ago now & I have not had any problems with my neck since. Moral of the story is, you must get the right neurosurgeon ""A Good One"" who is going to do the very best procedure possible, if you are not comfortable with the him ask for a 2nd or even a 3rd opinion. I still find it hard to believe that 2 senior consultants were prepared to do surgery that would have made my condition worse. I put it down to partly the NHS budget & also carelessness on the behalf of the first 2 consultants. The surgery I eventually ha,d ACDF, was a much longer procedure & obviously more expensive to the NHS. 1 like, 16 replies "

Unpleasant, and at the level experienced, nothing to be done. I googled (of course) and thought to try turmeric.  I am extremely wary of diet fads, supplements, the latest 'must do' and so on.  My research was as full as I could achieve! My diet is healthy, I neither drink nor smoke. My BMI is 25 and I am quite fit. Rather than try the various pills on offer  I went for the basics and started taking a teaspoon of turmeric powder daily.  I simply mix it with water - it's not very nice! My pain went in about ten days.  I still have the CS of course - and movement is still not what it should be, but there is no pain. I take no other supplements 'elixirs' or medicines with the exception of a nasal spray (for a polyp) and allopurinol for uric acid control (gout).

Cervical Smear and Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/doctor-patient-trust-659184,Doctor patient trust,"So in the last two years I have had two scope procedures. One was a full colonoscopy that so many biopsies were taken that I bled for weeks after and the pad they put below you to catch stuff was soaked in blood and goo. It made me sick and I felt like I was butchered. I then had a sigmoidoscopy to get done as my Crohn's disease is still bad and the doctor convinced me that it would be a good idea. I told her before the test that the only reason I am going through with it is I want to know how bad things are looking. I told her that 6 months ago I had many biopsies taken and I don't want any more of them done as I don't heal well after. She talked me into having two taken of bad areas. I said ok, but no more than that. So I get the results of the biopsies and they are all good no cancer. I doubt that that would have been missed 6 months ago when I was destroyed by my last doctor. When I looked at the lab results it stated I had 8 samples taken, I thought, how can that be when she said she was only taking two. How on earth can a person trust their doctor when they say one thing and do something else. I told her no more than two. I guess the point is I need to be able to trust that she will listen and do what I asked. Had she told me no way we need at least 12 then I would have canceled my appointment. So here I am bleeding badly again for weeks after. I do feel the need to get a new doctor as I am still upset about it months latter. I also need to have yet another scope done to see if the medication is working properly and this time I want no biopsies. My IBD is severe and they can see visually if it looks better than before or if there is no sign of disease. There is no need to chop me up again. I need to be able to trust my doctor and that is a huge deal for me, some don't care and want their doctor to do what ever they think is right. That is their choice, but I like to have some say in what is being done and I also want to know what is being done to me after I am put under. Trust is important. I need to feel I am in good hands when I am out. Not sure what I need to do to get that small amount of control I desire to make myself comfortable when I undergo these kinds of invasive tests. What can I do to get my doctor to understand how important that is for me. Any good ideas would be great or has anyone had a similar issue and fixed it? If so how? You would think I can just say hey doc no biopsies and we are good right and that would be all that is needed, but I tried that one and it didn't work. 0 likes, 3 replies "

There is nonspecific echogenic focus located eccentrically within the upper endometrial canal, hypoechoic relative to the endometrial stripe, measuring approximately 1.5 x 0.7 cm (image 17408) with no definite internal color Doppler flow.

Cataract,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/iol-edge-glare-anyone--617612,iol EDGE-GLARE anyone?,"The term ""edge glare"" (edge-dysphotopsia) can relate to many problems. Usually it's light on the side of the eye (a window during a sunny day, a lamp on the bedside table in the dark room, ceiling lights in shops) causing the side of the eye flickering, seeing half-arcs, peripheral glare/flare. All things never happened when I had my natural lens and it's my curiosity to know why this is happening to some people and some don't. It's usually goes away if u cover your sides with hand, so the light MUST coming from the side to produce that annoying condition. But it's really something related to the edge of the lens? Or the reflective index of it? Have read tons of researches showing that the problem is absolutely caused by the truncated edges of the iol and a high-reflective lens doesn't help either because reflects badly the light inside, making it bouncing internally. Any thought? Experiences with that? Did someone solve the problem by changing the lens for a ""less problematic"", with different features and design? Please answer. 0 likes, 46 replies "

I'm a 26 year old male that used to be quite active (bit of a gym nut lol) but since these symptoms started have been unable to support my usual activities My symptoms are as follows: I've had some tests done since then including: The Echo showed that my ejection fraction was less than 45 percent which concerned my cardiologist. He also noted that I presented symptoms of "" "" and raynaud's, which lead him to believe that my heart was, indeed, suffering from cardiomyopathy. This quickly followed with the MUGA and nuclear MRI. Ultimately these tests showed nothing all that concerning and my ejection fraction was roughly 55-58 percent. I won't be getting a follow-up until April so I'm assuming that that's the end of his investigating. Everything is fine, I guess. This has lead my GP to believe that I've been suffering from some sort of generalized   disorder. Another doctor suggested that I'm suffering from nutritional deficiency (I lost my colon to   in my early twenties). I'm not entirely sure if I buy into any of this, but at this point I'm willing to do anything to fix this. If anyone here can give me some advice I'd be thankful.

I had to quit work, I did not leave my home for 2 and a half months, my family thinks I am crazy, I beg your help. I had lots of tests done that I will provide after I write my symptoms. My heart rate upon standing goes from 80 (sitting) to 120-150 (standing). I know about POTS but no one believes in this condition and everyone says it's only anxiety. Sometimes during the evening (never in the morning or early day) my heart rate upon standing can be normal ~100. I also feel at least few hundred ectopics beats daily. My hearrate during sleep is 60, and it's 70-80 when I sit relaxed at my home. Last 2 months I also experienced lots panic attacks where my hearrate can go as high as 180 (example: I was far away from home and I knew I had long way to walk but I already was out of breath and suddently felt fear that I won't make it, that's when I had to lay down not to pass out because of tachycardia, so I called my family to come and take me with the car). I also experience fatigue, sometimes it's even stressful to go to the toilet, because every time I stand up I hate that heart pounding feeling in my chest. I forced myself to do some walking every day so for the past 2 weeks I do 20-30 minutes of walking in the fresh air in my garden (I can't go far away) and I did help a bit. I have tachycardia and anxiety symptoms for 2.5 years (I was able to exercise a lot in the first 1,5 years) but it's only 2 months since when I can't do much at all and I feel like 80 years old grandma, sitting at home all day. When I wake up I feel no anxiety at all I just stand up I breath deeply with my belly, I think about good stuff and my heartrate is still at least 120. Also 90% of the time when I sit after standing or any exercise I feel lots of ectopic beats for the next few minutes. I have sweety hands most of the time and I started to be very very pesimistic about my life. Now I met 3 cardiologists and 1 pscyhologist and they all said I am fine. These are tests I had done: Echocardiography (mitral valve prolapse which is very small and they said I cant have any symptoms from it), thyroid tests (all good), blood tests (all good), 8 EKG (all sinus tachycardia, heartrate varies from 105 to 130), 2 stress tests - all fine except synus tachycardia and 1PVC+1PAC (I was anxious so resting heart rates were 110 and 130, BP 130-80 140-90, HR reached 170 and 180). My relaxed BP is 120/70. So cardiologsists said dont search for anything just live your life or try pscyhologist. Psychologists said I just need to live my life or try cardiologist again. Is it possible it's all anxiety? I can't live normal life, I feel like 80 year old grandma inside young male body.

For about a week I keep getting random dizzy spells seemingly out of nowhere and during these I break into a hot sweat. This happened a few days ago when I was in line waiting to order food.

I had to sit on the floor to prevent passing out and then took the day off. I also get very sweaty at night lately even though the air conditioner is running as always. Because I have this history of palpitations and severely quick heart rate, to me this is just another red flag that something is wrong. (I have had heart rates close to 200bpm with little provocation) that send me to the emergency room. They always say your heart is racing but the beats themselves are normal so they label it as "" ."" I don't believe this to be true because I'll be having a normal, happy day until this hits OUT OF NOWHERE. I had a full blood work up 3 months ago and apparently everything looked fine (normal cholesterol, etc) except I'm very deficient in vitamin D which I now take supplements for. My doctor seems to be not worried at all about my palpitations, but since these frequent dizzy/sweat spells I'm not so sure. Do you think this is cardiac related? Or it sounds like it could be something else? My hands are literally drenched right now as I type this. So weird. Any advice or similar experiences would be so so appreciated. 0 likes, 4 replies "

Cardiac Arrhythmias,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/fluttering-in-chest-with-sudden-slowing-of-heartrate-687871,Fluttering in Chest with Sudden Slowing of Heartrate,"Recently, I was diagnosed with moderate-severe   (AR) and bought a single lead ECG to monitor for ectopic beats. While I have managed to capture and interpret the odd PAC and PVC, this one has me stumped. It always begins as a faint flutter in my chest. This is then followed up by a sudden and significant drop in heart rate as can be seen from the attached files. As the waves (PQRST) themselves show no deformation at all, I was wondering if this is something other than a regular ectopic as PVCs and PACs or even Afib would be clearly visible. I've had an echo and 24-hour Holter monitor done recently, but that turned up nothing (other than the AR). I've approached my own cardiologist on this issue, but he doesn't seem to think anything of it citing PVCs and PACs. Another cardiologist has said that it was respiratory sinus arrhythmia. However, these have been rather episodic and is something I have been experiencing only since the beginning of the year, lasting anywhere from two to twelve hours at a time. I have been trying to identify and eliminate triggers from caffeine and large meals to poor sleep but to no avail. Before I started taking beta-blockers in August to reduce episodes of   and tachycardia, these sudden slow beats would be associated with tachycardia and cause my heart rate to maintain in the 100s for hours. I didn't have the portable ECG at that time yet, so I only have the waveform from a pulse-oximeter to illustrate the events. While I don't have any symptoms like fainting or   during these episodes, they tend to cause anxiety and mild chest discomfort as I am very aware of the sensations. If it is simply respiratory sinus arrhythmia, why does it become so pronounced from time to time? Could it be just a regular fluctuation of my heart rate that I've just become far more sensitive to? Or is it related to body position/muscle spasm that leads to heart irritation? Or does it have something to do with the AR? Or is it something more serious like sick sinus syndrome/sinus block? The thing is, I've rather at my wit's end as I've tried  so many things over these past months to no avail and none of my cardiologists seem to be able to tell me what's going on.

Cardiac Arrhythmias,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/reposting-new-idea-for-ectopic-beats-695798,Reposting New Idea For Ectopic Beats,"This is an update to a post I wrote about 6 months ago. For some reason a moderator removed it because of inappropriate content.  This is really working for me and has virtually eliminated  ectopic beats which I have struggled with for years.  I would urge the moderators to allow this post to stand or contact me with any concerns.  Thank-you. Hi, I've struggled with ectopic beats for years.  Here's something that I've discovered that has helped significantly.  Standing on aluminum foil.  I know that may sound crazy, but please read on and try this for a couple of weeks.  With limited success,  I have followed all the usual advice for reducing ectopic beats - eliminating caffeine, exercising regularly, reducing stress, breathing exercises, vagus nerve procedures, taking a magnesium supplement, eliminating alcohol, changing my diet,  drinking plenty of water, trying to change focus, adjusting my posture, not over exercising etc. etc.  In the past, I was also been prescribed beta blockers - which creates a whole new set of problems. We know that ectopic beats are often related to stress and anxiety.  One of the reasons that beta blockers can be somewhat effective is that they reduce the influence of adrenaline on the body.  However, this is, perhaps, only addressing the symptoms of the problem and not the cause. I have come to believe that the cause of ectopic beats is stress.  Some of this stress is created by the body's exposure to EMFs  and dirty electricity.  These powerful, technology driven EMFs and dirty electricity  interfere with our body's own electromagnetic field.  This interference creates more stress in our bodies, messes with our adrenaline and impacts the electrical system in our heart resulting in ectopic beats that may be harmless, but drive some of us crazy. I stumbled upon the idea of standing on aluminum foil through the work of Dave Stetzer .  I was investigating grounding as a way to stop my ectopic beats and he warned that grounding can be harmful Instead he recommended ""balancing our electrical activity by simply standing on a piece of aluminum foil in our bare feet for 30 to 60 seconds. Our feet will act like two electrical terminals, and the aluminum foil will conduct the electrical activity in our body back and forth between our feet until it reaches a point of balance. If you don’t like aluminum, then you could stand on stainless steel. It doesn’t matter whether the foil is on wood or carpet. Nothing is being drained off.""  See also I have not read anyone suggesting this strategy to help prevent ectopic beats.  But after trying this...I believe that it has helped me tremendously.  Here's what I did.  I taped a long piece of aluminum foil to a board and I keep it about 20 feet from my computer.  Every morning, I stand on it with my feet spread apart in bare feet for a few minutes.  I also do it at night.  ( I also am exposed to EMFs when I sleep because I use a CPAP machine with a heated hose with an electric coil).  I also step on the aluminum foil once in a while when I take a break from my computer to discharge the electricity in my body. I use my cordless phone and cell phone on speaker mode only.  I have also turned off wi-fi in my home and when I do connect my cell phone via mobile data, I make sure to step on the aluminum foil to discharge my body after physical contact with my phone.

But for these last 5 or 6 years Ive been having those pvcs,pacs, pretty regularly. And lately tachycardia episodes have been somewhat regular too.

Lately Ive been very sedentary and when I try to exercise I get palpitations. No other symptoms tho. My issues dont stop there. for about 5 years too, Ive been suffering from GERD, my last endoscopy showed improvement, but I dont feel much better. Most days I feel bloated or with esophagus or stomach disconfort and pain, despite sticking to the diet the gastrologist gave me. (No citrics, or spices, fatty, fried food, chocolate, coffee, etc). The GERD combined with the constant palpitations are driving me crazy.  Recently I feel all sorts of weird symptoms like lack of balance, tremors, dizzy spells, and things like that. Ive been to the ER several times because of fear of having something bad, but everytime all test look fine. So Im thinking those additional symptoms might be psychosomatic in nature. I dont know anymore. I feel like crap all the time. Ive also been skinny guy all my life, but all my vitamin and nutrient test appear to be on normal ranges and I love eating, it just doesnt help that my GERD diet is so restrictive.

I am a male, 42 years old, smoking many years, not known health issues– only cystitis on the bladder removed through   last year. This left chest discomfort is mostly below the left nipple and sometimes move to the left (on the armpit) or to the right (close to center of chest). This feeling/pain makes be miserable and prevent me from every day activities including work. When happens sometimes I feel like to faint and seek emergency advise as soon as possible. Not much stress at work. AT times I do not have that feeling heavy headaches are coming. When initially started (February 2018) I went to the emergency and made all related exams (ECG, blood testing, X ray) which came back fine. After for a period of three months I went another 4 times to the emergency doing the same with same results. In addition, I have been to various professions (cardiac, gastro, pulmonologist, neurologist, neurosurgeon, rheumatologist, physical therapy). All related tests including ECGs, echo, Trend mill, CT heart with dye (cardiac), CT thoracic, fluoroscopy, endoscopy,  (gastro), various   including prostate, thyroid etc., CT chest, various X rays at numerous directions, X ray neck, and physical examination by neurologist were found ok. In addition, I did physical therapy including TENS, magnetic fields, laser, and massage. However, although the results of all tests were ok I was having the same chest discomfort on a daily basis which was a bit relieved only by placing hot plaster at chest. At early June 2018, the gastro doctor has prescribed amitriptyline (at 10mg daily before sleep which later on increased to 20mg). After some time (2 weeks) chest heaviness/discomfort was reduced in frequency to the half (instead of daily it was every two to three days). However, at mid-September I realize that amitriptyline was not adding any value and thus I stopped it. A week after the chest heaviness/discomfort came back more intense every day lasting the whole day and did not go away with ibuprofen, paracetamol, etc. The only thing which a bit produce a relief was capsicum plasters placed either on the back or chest side (due to the heat the discomfort was felt taken off). I went the last three weeks again to the emergency and GP and prescribed with baclofen which I took for almost two weeks with no results at all. Then, last week, the gastro doctor advise to start again the amitriptyline (initially to 10mg). As a conclusion, after having all these exams and pills nothing has been improved and the chest heaviness/discomfort is still here all day every day. Doctors told me that is something muscular/neuro, however, when I asked them whether it is  ,  , or rheumatic polymyalgia they told me that they do not believe. As such the matter was left open with diagnosis of atypical chest pain. Can you please help me??????? 0 likes, 2 replies "
Cardiovascular Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/how-to-take-care-after-heart-transplant-surgery--697995,How to take care after heart transplant surgery?,"A 'successful' heart transplant surgery offers a new chapter of life to the patient. You must be wondering why did I write 'successful' before the heart transplant surgery. It is because not every cardiovascular surgery is accomplished with positive results. Instead, there can be complications which can cause risk and various side effects on the patient, in some cases, the results can be life-threatening as well. But if the patient shows strict compliance with the rehabilitation program after operation with whatever happened prescribed, heart transplant surgery provides a new lease of healthy life to the patient. It is important that even after the heart transplant surgery has completed and the likewise rehabilitation programs have been properly followed, the recommended lifestyle modifications such as change in diet, exercise patterns, driving routine, medicines intake have to be still incorporated for the entire life to the heart's health is maintained and the patient leads a happy and healthy life. A heart transplant surgery and the followed up post-operative care are as important as the operation in itself because the former ensures that the health of the heart is kept in check and the wanted growth in the working and health of the patient is met. Thereby, if a patient who underwent a heart transplant surgery wants to be healthy and accomplish the expected ideals of the surgery, it is important that he or she knows the importance of rehabilitation programme and post-operative care. We have further dealt with these components specifically. Rehabilitation Program An effective rehabilitation program is manufactured after evaluating the condition of the patient after heart transplant surgery. The overall well being of the patient and the outcome of the surgery is also considered while composing the practices and activities of a rehabilitation program. Doctors make sure that no component of the rehabilitation programs put excessive pressure on the health of the patient. Driving Patients who have heart problems even if they undergo heart treatments through surgeries such as in this case, it is advised to not drive after the surgery. Especially, a strict recommendation is to not drive while moving from hospital to home post hospital discharge and likewise in the follow up for at least 3 to 4 months. Any sort of driving should be avoided, doctors advise to call a friend or relative for aiding the patient to shift from the hospital and even public transport should be avoided, if possible. Medications Just after the heart transplant surgery, the patient is provided with anti-inflammatory medications and pain killers for instant relief from operational pain. After the procedures has ended and the routine of medicines for the rehabilitation programs has been completed, the patient is still kept on their dosage for their entire lifetime. These medicines should be taken as advised by the doctor, the same procedure for intake, the time for eating them, and the related precautions should be followed always without any slack. Diet The type of food we eat, it is a major factor for impacting health. Cardiologists recommend taking a well-balanced diet with proper portions of nutrients and vitamins. Any sort of unnecessary salts, sugar, and fats should be avoided. Include green leafy vegetables and fresh fruits in the daily intake, cut down on harmful elements like caffeine and junk food. Any food which can lead to cholesterol increase or plaque formation, it should be strictly avoided. 2 likes, 0 replies "

It gets better when I lay flat or kind of keep my mind off of it, but sometimes I get so out of breath I can hardly walk or talk or swallow. And I’ll start trembling and I’ll get really weak. I also have these huge heart “thumps” whenever I breath in deep or bend over. (I’m not sure how else to describe the feeling). I’ve been having pain in my jaw for several days now, on both sides. And a little in my neck. The pain starts with my chest. It’s not really bad pain and I usually ignore it. I’ve been to several doctors and even a heart specialist who refuses to do any further testing because I’m 18 and it’s “most likely”  . But I don’t feel like it’s anxiety. The shortness of breath gets worse with certain body positions, and also after eating meals. I also get extreme fatigue and very rarely but it happens, blood in stool, which I’ve been noticing for sometime.

She would not be put on a transplant list because she did drugs and they wouldn't wast a new heart on her. Part of me understood but the mom part was furious; she deserved a chance to start over fresh. But they told her to quit drugs and take her medication. Meanwhile I searched the internet for ways to manage her CHF. 8 years later, my daughter continuing her lifestyle, had problems with her heart and the Dr put in an implantable cardioventer defibulator (ICD), which would help her heart beat normally and provide shock if needed. They offer that when your in your 3rd stage.I thought that right there would scare her into quitting dope, smoking and to eat healthy. No, she left the hospital and didn't change a thing. That was 5 years ago, she had an episode 2 months ago, I thought it was the end, it so scary. She had all the symptoms of the final stages: coughing weeding, spitting up bloody phlem, she was huge with bloat, her heart wasnt pumping the blood fast enough so it was building up fluid around her heart, feet, belly and ankles.She was in pain, could breath,  ; all signs were there, I just knew this was It, I couldn't begin to tell you what I was going through. She wouldn't go to the hospital because she said she wanted to die at home. I did get her to her Dr and her heart was 7% working. For those of you that don't know what that means, it's not her heartbeat but the percentage of blood thats pumped from her heart to her body every heartbeat.  55-70% is normal, anything less means not enough oxygen rich blood going through the body. Her Dr says she wants to put my daughter on Enestro, it has been doing great things for a year now and even though each person is different and there's no guarentees,this pill should keep her ""heart beating and out of the hospital""!!  Wow, sounds too good to be true. With that pill and her other ones, taken faithly, stop smoking, no drugs, exercise, watch her sodium and liquid intake, she will add a couple years to her life. Her heart is already pumping 15-20% now. if only she saw the need to change her lifestyle...but no. Don't think I haven't begged and pleaded and tried to reason with her, cuz I have, Ive shed many tears. I cant for the life of me understand why her life doesnt mean more to her, I know she doesnt want to die. If not for herself, for her 12 year old. 0 likes, 5 replies "

Carpal Tunnel,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/7-years-post-surgery-676742,7 years post surgery,"Hi, I thought I'd comment on my experiences with Carpal Tunnel Surgery. I had both hands done privately about 7 years ago at the age of 37. It's apparently unusual for both hands to be done together but, it minimised my downtime, and got me back to work much quicker. The initial recovery was relatively quick and the 6-8 weeks time guide is about right. You have to realise that just because the hand appears healed it doesn't mean you can carry on as normal though. 3-4 months later I still struggled to hold a garden spade and drive it into the ground or to lift something heavy as it would send an excruciating pain through my hand, it took about 12 months for this pain to have completely passed. Living with the after effects though, I sometimes wonder whether it was the right thing to do. My hands disturbed my sleep and the systems would have eventually withered away my thumb muscle but, at the time I had strong hands. Now I can easily open a narrow bottle like lemonade but, a wide rimmed jam jar is a lot harder to get a good grip of, and occasionally this is beyond me. It doesn't continue to affect me lifting anything but my hands do tire quickly. I get muscle fatigue very quickly in hands and wrists now even if I'm doing a simple activity like rubbing butter and flour together for a cake, I couldn't do an 8oz mix without a lot of pain in my thumb pad for instance. My hands now ache in places they never did before, the thumb pad is a given this muscle is worked really hard but, I also have ache's in the tendons across the back of my hands between my fingers, and the bones between the joints in my fingers often ache. It isn't constant and I have to be conscious of my objectives and my time limits when carrying out tasks. If they are too grip heavy I will really pay for it later in the day. Carpal tunnel surgery releases a very specific pressure but, the hand is a very complex machine and with each action, there is a counteraction, when you cut the tendon strength that joins the two muscle pads of the hand you remove the shared load, each has to now work in a different way to achieve the same result and it creates other issues and pressures. I would love to see the muscles of my hands now compared with someone that has not had surgery as I'm sure they would differ in their make up. My advice would be to do some additional research prior to having surgery and only use surgery as a last resort. It's a simple surgeons procedure done under local anaesthetic with minimal surgery complications but, for you, it's a different story. You have to live with the ongoing niggles created by the release, and accept that it's a trade off between the loss of sensation, numbness and muscle wastage against the aches and pains of the lack of hand strength created by the loss of the ligament support. There are days when I think I made the wrong decision and others when I'm not even conscious of hand problems. You'll often find me massaging my thumb pads in turn with the other thumb to relieve the ache and tightness of everyday simple activities. I hope this helps others.   2 likes, 1 reply "

I went to  see  my surgeon 2 days ago and he prescribed antibiotic 500 mg  and non steroidal, anti inflammatory  10 mg. for me to take 4 times a day for 10 days. i've been taking this for 2 days already but the numbness and swollen still stay constantly as well as the little lump near the incision site. can someone help me or advise me what to do or someone having the same issue. PLEASE HELP ME. THANK YOU 0 likes, 12 replies "

Carpal Tunnel,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/when-to-see-a-doctor-687544,when to see a doctor,"I haven't been diagnosed with carpal tunnel recently, but around 13 years ago, i developed it while pregnant. For around four months I dealt with the annoying numbness and extreme pain - especially during the night. It went away after my child was born. It came back a few years ago, but they were mostly annoying symptoms: numb hands waking me up as I tried to sleep - thankfully no pain - and I noticed I was constantly dropping things. Something else is happening and I'm not sure its from the carpal tunnel. Every couple months pain in my wrist - the joint, around the carpals would slowly get worse and more painful until it peaked for a few days, then slowly go away. All together this would take a month or so. Sometimes  it happened in my shoulder. Recently i'd gone almost a year without it happening. About 2 weeks ago it started again in my wrist. But this time its much, much worse. The pain is not only in my wrist, but travels up into my fingers. There is a kind of achy pain similar to carpal tunnel pain. Its started to go away, but its a very slow process. Is it time for me to see a doctor? Should i wait for the pain to be at its worst before i see a doctor? 0 likes, 3 replies "

Carpal Tunnel,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/carpal-tunnel-surgery-7-11-18-669204,Carpal tunnel surgery 7/11/18,"I have suffered from CT for 10 plus years in both my R and L hands.  I also have RA. After years of pain,sleepless nights, prednisone, medrol paks and cortisone injections, I decided to have surgery on my left,  non-dominate hand.  Nerve conduction tests confirmed Severe in L and  Moderate in R. My surgery was 7/11/18. My orthopedic hand surgeon was performing a mini-open procedure. I arrived at the surgery center at 7 am. Had an IV put in. Talked with Dr and anesthesiologist. I was brought in for surgery at 8:15(surgery was 10-15 min) and was in recovery for a short time and was home by 10AM.  I was in NO PAIN after surgery and still have no pain.  My hand was in a brace(fingers free and able to move them)that I left on for 5 days. I was able to remove brace and get stitches wet on Monday 7/16 and had stitches out today,7/19.( incision was about an inch long and I had four stitches) I returned to work the day after surgery and drove myself. I own a business and it was mostly office work.  I am R-handed so that helped. The day after surgery and since then I have been able to move my fingers, open a doorknob,shop, cook, dry my hair with a hairdryer, etc.  It really is remarkable.  With such a successful surgery, I plan on getting my right hand done in a month or two.  I put this surgery off for too many years(because I was unsure of recovery time) and feel bad for anyone whose recovery is taking a long time.  I only posted this to help people know that some surgeries come off without any issues. I live in CT and if anyone wants to know who did my surgery, I will be happy to tell you.  Good Luck to everyone who is dealing with CT.    2 likes, 8 replies "

Maybe others will add their own tips.:) I found two solutions for night-time driving glare: Here's the Amazon title ""Car Windshield Tac Sun Visor Night Anti-Glare - Zone Tech Premium Quality Universal Sunshade and Night Vision Anti-Dazzle Windshield Driving Visor"". It cost $15 and was delivered free within 2 days. Don't try the similar product advertised on TV as the ""Battle Visor"". They're a scam company, unfortunately. Never delivered product & I had to call my cr cd company to get the charge removed. 2)I add some pale turquoise sunglasses for the 2-lane road to my house, populated with lots of new cars with bright bluish-white LED headlights. Between the two, I have little problem with glare anymore.:) 2 likes, 17 replies "
Cataract,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/does-it-matter-which-lens-goes-in-the-dominant-eye--694193,Does it matter which lens goes in the dominant eye?,"My left eye is going to need cataract surgery  and then the right eye maybe another year from now. The left eye is non-dominant and near sighted and right is dominant and far sighted. The doctor said we can put a multi-focal or mono-focal lens in the non-dominant left. I am leaning toward the multi-focal lens and then later replace the right eye with a multi-focal or mono-focal lens depending on what I want. But from what I've been reading is that it is better to put the distance lens on the dominant eye. If i put a multi-focal lens in the non-dominant eye and then later put a mono-focal lens set for near or medium vision for reading will my brain have a hard time especially  since that's the opposite of how  I see right now. I know if I go with two multi-focal lenses it won't be an issue. But if I do go with a modified mono-vision set up would it be better to replace the left non-dominant near sight eye with the mono-vision lens  for reading and then later on get the multi-focal lens in the dominant right eye for distance and driving? 0 likes, 4 replies "
