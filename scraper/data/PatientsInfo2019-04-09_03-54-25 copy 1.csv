Cystoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/cystoscopy-650434,Cystoscopy,"I had a cystoscopy yesterday. I was very nervous when I was told by my doctor to undergo the procedure. I quite remember in 2004  I had a similar one but was put to sleep so when the Doctor told me it will be performed with my eyes on, I was a little bit skeptical. Got in the clinic with this fear built in mind but the fear disappeared when the nurse injected me with a medicine to numb my penis. The doctor then used a tiny camera and inserted it in my penis and pushed it slowly to my bladder and other parts. The only discomfort I felt was when it hit my prostate. The experience was not difficult as I envisaged. Technology has developed to extend that things that were difficult to do of late as become easy to cope by. 1 like, 3 replies "

There was a lot of improvement but I still suffer from anxiety/panic attacks. My psych doc tried increasing the Quetiapine dose up to 400 mg but I didn't notice any improvement. Looks like 200 mg is the optimum dose. If my sleep quality is good, the day will be very calm and relaxed. I observed that if I take Quetiapine 200 mg + Diazepam 10 mg before sleep then my anxiety/panic attacks are totally under control. Sleep quality was very good. There was no daytime drowsiness either. It was just perfect. But the problem is that benzodiazepines are not for long-term use. So, we have been trying to find other medications that can augment Quetiapine just like Diazepam did. 1. Quetiapine 200 mg + Trazodone 50 mg caused a lot of drowsiness and daytime dizziness. I could not take the combination for more 5 days. 2. Quetiapine 200 mg + Tegretol 300 mg actually reduced the sleep quality and increased anxiety (Tegretol and Trileptal reduce the effectiveness of Quetiapine).  3. Quetiapine 200 mg + Lithium caused a lot of daytime drowsiness but there was no improvement in my anxiety/panic attacks. What other medications can I take along with Quetiapine before sleep to further improve the sleep quality? Is anyone taking any medications in addition to Quetiapine before sleep?

Interesting side note: when I sneeze, I’m almost garunteed to twitch somewhere on my body after I tense up. I haven’t noticed any weakness since this whole ordeal started, as, I recently participated in a soccer event in which I just felt tired afterwords (during the game my legs didn’t feel “weak”). Today, my right and left foot won’t stop fibrillating or fasciculating (I can’t see  the twitching I can only feel it) and other parts of my body twitch occasionally too. I read sone article about “singular” causing fasciculations but I’m not sure because my pediatrician didn’t say that he knew if that was a cause. I just want to know the cause of my twitching because it’s irritating on top of the fact that I have (mild) eczema.

When it started I was pretty sure that I had IBS. My intestines would make rumbling noises 24/7 and I was paler than a white wall. Never felt any pain though which led me to believe that I must have a different disorder.  For almost 2 years I couldn't workout or do any physical activities, I felt so weak. Then I slowly tried to workout in the gym again. Until today I still have the same problem when I workout my legs and my back. Doing this causes my intestines to stop working properly. It's the worst when I have DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) on my upper legs and my back. Also for a very long time my lower back felt like jelly when working out. I'm not a doctor, so I don't know how to describe this in any other way. Also generally walking or talking/yelling which involves the use of belly/back muscles would make the condition worse. I'm recovering very slowly, it definitely feels better than 2 years ago, but if it continues at this pace, it will take another 3 or 5 years till I have recovered at least 80%. I've tried taking epsom salts, magnesium and red light therapy but nothing seemed to improve my condition.  Anyone else having similar issues??  0 likes, 0 replies "

I do not believe I have CFS now after the past month of therapy. I started having severe neck pains on my right half near where my jugular is early this summer in May. My DR put me in anti inflame pills in late May and a few others but they never helped? June-August I got better and worse at the same time, I saw a physical therapist in August. After spending 1 month with him and $1,200 to my insurance I have been the healthiest I have been in 3 years. I have been at the gym once or twice a week since September which I haven't done in about two years. Yet my problem lingers and its not 100% health and sometimes it flares back up. Granted I am not doing everything I did when I saw my PT, I have since stopped. I probably should go back to it but I wanted to see if it would clear up on its own. He said the right half of my necks muscle is enlarged/bigger than the left half. He did notice it improved after I saw him and I could turn my neck better. It was bad during the months before I saw him, sometimes turning my neck would cause me to have anxiety/panic during a flare up but other times I would be perfectly okay. Recently I have started running as part of a new job I am taking, this is the hardest physical endurance I have been under in years. I ran a 11 minute mile, but I am still getting flare ups every now and then. The problem is I still would like to know if anyone else has something similar?

My rehab doc told me you can’t really measure throat muscle with EMG because it is dangeraous and they tested my tongue said it is same nerve system.

I asked my father to get a new MRI again but he says it's too expensive. but I just want to note that it's best not to base the recommendation solely based on these outdated MRI finding. as I mentioned before, my father as of recently is able to perform the task of 360 degree rotation of his upper arms around his shoulders, something he couldn't do when he first got his muscles torn back in March. ) FINDINGS: There is enlargement of the AC joint. there is irregularity of the inferior aspect of the acromion. there are high-grade partial tears with severe tendinosis of the tendons of supraspinatus and infraspinatus.leakage of fluid into the subacromial and subdeltoid space is clearly demonstrated without retraction of the partially torn tendons of supraspinatus and infraspinatus. the subscapularis and teres minor are intact.the glenoid is intact. the labrum of the glenoid is well preserved. significant irregularity with subchondral cystic formation of the greater tuberosity of the humeral head is identified. the coracoacromial ligament is mildly thickened. Impression: High-grade partial tears of the tendons of the supraspinatus and supraspinatus with leakage of fluid in the subacromial and subdeltoid space of the left shoulder. excessive osteophyte formation of the greater tuberosity of the humeral head and irregularity of the inferior aspect of the acromion are most likely the causes of rotator injury. chronic recurrent injuries by chronic impingement should be considered. no retraction of the injured tendons of supraspinatus and infraspinatus demonstrated, however.  should we get surgery or only physical therapy.

No cramping or pain," Hello everyone. I have an issue I am hoping to get some info or advice on. About 2 1/2 weeks ago I started getting strong twitches when I would lay down to go to sleep. They were the real strong all body ones that jerk you back awake. At first I thought they were just normal hypnagogic jerks. I was taking Lexapro for a couple weeks and thought it was that causing it. The Lexapro did have other symptoms that I didnt like so I stopped it after talking to my doctor. I was only on it about 2 weeks. Anyway I thought that the twitching would stop after the Lexapro was out of my system. Well I no longer think that had anything to do with it because they are still happening after being off of the Lexapro for 17 days now.  The twitching is not just when I lay down anymore. Its basically every few minutes on all different parts of the body one at a time. They are very quick, painless, and happen on all different muscles. Best described as a ""tic"" I guess. Anyway I do also have some back of the neck stiffness and after talking to Dr. Google I found that this might just be a magnesium deficiency. Both of these symptoms are linked to that. Today I went out and bought some supplements and bananas. But even before this I was eating at least one banana a day.   Anyway I am just trying to get some ideas as to what this might be?

I've noticed that it comes and goes when I'm doing normal everyday activities like washing the dishes or washing my hair in the shower. Normally, it doesn't happen at all while I'm sitting, only standing. It basically feels like it goes numb for a bit, and doesn't go away until I sit down and rest my back up against something. There isn't any pain associated with the tingling, so it's more of a nuisance than anything. I don't have the best posture because I sit all day long, however I do strength train 4-5 days a week consistently. I'm wondering which type of doctor I should go to to get this checked out (I was thinking orthopedist), and what this could possibly be? I would guess it would have to be something with my hips and/or neck. 0 likes, 1 reply "
Muscle Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/muscle-low-pain-arms-legs-680277,"Muscle low pain, arms, legs","Hi! Not sure this is the right forum. Since several years I am experiencing bizarre symptoms: now and then I feel low-level pain in the arm and leg muscles. The pain kind of moves through the muscles, up and down and again and again. It is more or less like the sore muscles after a strong workout, but it moves, it does not stay in the same place in the muscles. After this muscle ""moving pain"", I feel like the body temperature raises, and it comes a body lethargy. This forces me to stop doing what I am doing, and doze. After around 10-20 minutes on this lethargy (I do not sleep, I  feel like I am paralyzed), I feel my muscles and body strength coming back again. In one or two minutes I am good to go again. And I can go back to what I was doing. I feel good, vigorous and it seems nothing had happened. This seems not to have any cycle, it happens every  couple of days and sometimes I am free of this during one or two weeks. I discussed this issue with a couple of physicians, they either do not care or do not know/are not willing to investigate the causes. The problem is when I am working, it takes me a superhuman effort not to doze on the desk! Sometimes I need to go quickly to the toilet in order to have some privacy and I sit on the vase, lock the door doze in my knees and can wait until the cycle muscle pain-body temperature-lethargy passes away and my body strength comes back and I can go back to work. Thinking about it, I started to have those symptoms around 20 years ago, but now they are more frequent and are bothering me/complicating my work. I wonder if anybody have heard of this symptoms. Any advice/hint/guess is welcome. Rgs EM 0 likes, 3 replies "
Muscle Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/weird-neck-stuff-689215,Weird neck stuff,"About 6 months ago, the right side of my neck started to feel unsupported.  Around the same time, my right sternocleidomastoid muscle started to show while at rest; asked family doc about it, she said no big deal. Three months ago, I turned my head to the right side and it cracked.  Sharp pain for a split second.  This happened a couple of times if I remember correctly.  Since then, the deep neck flexor in the back of my neck has been exceptionally weak and the superficial muscles (including the  sternocleidomastoid) exceptionally tight.  I have lots of knots in the side of my neck and the muscles feel stringy.  Also, the omohyoid (the one that connects the side of the neck to the top of the shoulder) feels like it is straight up not there.  I can't properly relax my right shoulder.  It's constantly being pulled forward and up by the tight muscles at the front of the neck.  I've had tingling down my right arm and feel general weakness and muscle wasting.  It's not painful or debilitating; just concerning. My family doc sent me to a neurologist, but so far neuro exams (nerve conduction and EMG) have been normal.  MRI of brain from Aug ruled out   and MS.  Blood tests(CK and ANA) are normal as well.  I have a cervical spine MRI booked in the new year. I've had several massages and two osteopath treatments and nothing has helped to release the tension.   I've been seeing a physiotherapist who is working to rebuild my deep neck flexors, but still wondering WTF is going on?  Can you tear a muscle and not have pain?  Could there be a tumor or lump pushing on the muscles?  Should I have more imaging done?  Has anyone experienced something similar?  And if so, how did you find relief? 0 likes, 0 replies "

Muscle Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/a-poking-like-sensation-on-various-parts-of-my-body-39590,A poking-like sensation on various parts of my body,"I’m not sure if my case could be classified as muscle disorder, but definitely there is something wrong with it. I’ve been suffering from sleep disorder for the past ten years. One of the symptoms that keep on interrupting my sleep at night is a sensation of a very focused pulsation, a poking-like sensation, on various parts of my body: head, neck, limbs, torso, everywhere. Most of the time it feels like someone is poking my body physically with a thin but strong object such as a blunt pencil tip. The intensity varies from time to time. When it gets strong it makes me feel like I’m being hit by a hammer; when it gets sharp it feels like a needle head pricking my body. Sometimes it’d hit me continuously when I try to fall asleep so that I wouldn’t be able to sleep; sometimes it’d hit certain spots on my body during my sleep and repeat itself in succession until I’m woken up, and sometimes just a single hit would get me up at night. It has been a major part of the symptoms of my sleep disorder, among other things. This particular one has gradually moved from happening during my sleep at night to happening when I am fully awake during daytime. So technically I can’t really think of it as simply sleep disorder anymore. It puzzles me a great deal. There is nothing I can do to prevent it from happening, and there is no cure I know of that might help. It doesn’t matter where I’m in the world, it just follows me around. I know it sounds strange and it feels strange to be plagued by this torturous thing. For a long period of time I’ve been suffering it in silence. I don’t know how to deal with it, but I know I have to live with it everyday for the past decade. Has anyone experienced a similar disorder and found a cure? If so, please share with me. Could anyone offer some suggestions as to how I should treat this horrible disorder? I need your help desperately. Thanks 1 like, 24 replies "

I did a EMG test on October 23, 2018 for all the four members (lower and upper) and it was normal.  Then I started taking a muscle relaxant containing benzodiazepine, and the spasms went away.

Last night, I woke up and couldn't go back to sleep, and the spasm in my upper left arm has lasted for about an unusual TEN or ELEVEN hours at stretch.

It all started with twitching on my right thumb however I'm not sure if it started a day or two before I took the medication or after because everything happened around the same time. This is the part that really has me in agony. After being on Wellbutrin for 6 days with just a twitch in the thumb which was aggravated when I use my smartphone,  I started getting light twitches in various parts of my body, my legs arms back chest. It was enough to scare me and I immediately got off the medication however the symptoms did not go away, in fact they got worse! I immediately told my psychiatrist and then had to wait another week to see my PCP. My PCP didn't do anything except tell me that I might have   now from the medication and I need to see a neurologist ASAP! Of course this freaked me out and I went through the list of neurologist on my insurance and of course couldn't see any of them for another month. I have an appointment finally on March 27th. Many times I wanted to just go to the emergency room but was told they won't do anything either but send me home with they request to see a neurologist. Now I sit here in complete panic everyday not even being able to sleep. Looking up of course shows all the other horrible issues that could be causing this because the doctors don't understand why it was still be happening after 3 weeks of taking the medication so it could have triggered something else going on with me! So far the symptoms were thumb twitching that ended up going into my arm then twitching in my other arm and then the top of my thighs, my hamstrings, my calves, sometimes my feet, in my face in my back, stomach, pecks all day long. I don't feel   except the kind when you have   attacks and then it feels like you can't walk for like 30 minutes and then everything will go back to normal but I do have muscle soreness from the spots where I get the twitching the most. Most of all the twitching in my body repeat in the same place with occasional few new ones that travel around. I also get tingling and burning sensations in my feet legs and arms but that happens like every few days. The only thing that relieves it is if I take massive amounts of magnesium like 500 mg a day and keep on it if I skip a day I have bad Twitches that day. I was a vegetarian and now I started eating meat again oh, that's how scared I am and I'm doing so to help with my muscles. The only abnormal thing on a blood test I had in November before this happened was a high MCH count showing that I could be low in vitamin B12. For years I've also been low and vitamin D and I have been taking 3,000 units a day and I have moved it up to a level of 26. It also showed on my thyroid test that I was two points away from being hypothyroidism but the doctor didn't seem concerned about any of this. All other electrolytes and hormones were normal however again this was 5 months ago and these symptoms started three weeks ago during medication of a generic Wellbutrin. It's so hard waiting another three weeks to be seen buy a neurologist and then I know I'm going to have to wait more weeks until I can get scheduled in for MRI, that electric muscle testing and so on.

It slowly but surely is starting to affect my everyday life. I don't think that I have lost a noticeable amount of muscle power but I feel like there is no energy stored in my muscles.  I feel like an old battery, drained within a short time. After exercise my muscles are very sore and recovery is very slow. (So far I have tried warm baths with Magnesium salts and Ibuprofen.) I had some  , full blood count, Vit D, Vit B12, creatine kinase level, but did not have a chance to talk to my doctor yet.

Muscle Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/muscle-twitches-and-spasms-all-over-body-548447,Muscle twitches and spasms all over body,"This particular problem started about 5 years ago, however it was much more mild and not as worrying. The muscle twitches originally started in my feet and legs, and was more of an annoyance than anything. At the time I also had trouble sleeping, so my doctor suggested a sleep study, perhaps the twitching was causing my body to not fully fall asleep. However, the sleep study did not show any abnormalities in my sleep pattern. The twitching eventually subsided/became less noticeable, and I forgot about it.  In the last 30-45 days or so, however, I have noticed the twitching both returning and being much more frequent, and also accompanied by muscle spasms as well. The twitching occurs all over my body, including; feet, ankles, calves, thighs, knees, glutes, wrists, fingers, elbow muscles, and biceps. The muscle spasms have only occured in my thighs, calves, and glutes and are not as common. The spasms are very rapid and only last for a few seconds. I decided to keep track of the frequency of the twitching for a 5 minute span (both laying down and in a sitting position) and it occured around 8-10 times within 5 minutes (varying from fingers, glutes, thighs, calves, etc). I am worried that these symptoms may lead to something greater, as I am only 20 years old and am not sure if it will become worse as time progresses. I should also mention that I am prescribed 150 mg Wellbutrin and birth control daily, and have also been taking painkillers as needed for the past few weeks due to surgery. I also suffer from mild-moderate  . I do not believe that this is a side-effect from my medication, as I have been on these medications the past few years. I am not opposed to visiting the doctor, I just don't know if a specific doctor would be necessary or any other advice would be helpful.  0 likes, 243 replies "

I'm a 37yr old male, not in the best shape but far from out of shape.  I'm active, I go to the gym, I race dirt bikes, hike, and you normal every day guy.  Since my 20's I've had a left knee that has steadily been getting worse.  Last year diagnosed as Patella Pain Syndrome.  In 2014 I had a bad skydiving landing (tandem) and the instructor made us land on our butts, needless to say my tailbone took the weight of both of us and I spent a year going to a chiropractor for lower pack pain and neck pain.  I stopped going in fall '15.  In Oct 2015 I did a very rough dirt bike race which left me beat up, my hands were buzzing, sore back and wrists.  This wasn't abnormal and I know I'm getting older so I didn't think anything of it however over a month later my right wrist was still sore and then at night I started waking up with my hands and feet feeling numbish (that feeling as your limb is falling asleep but not fully pins and needs asleep).  I never had the pins and needles feeling, just the numbing type feeling.  It extended to my mid forearms and upper calves.  I saw my PCP who told me it was probably stress related (panic or anxiety disorder) and gave me some xanax.  I hate taking pills so I never took them and instead followed up with a neurologist.   My neuro did the in office quick evaluation and said it probably wasn't ALS or MS because the symtoms would disappearing and reoccuring and sure enough around Dec, the symptoms disappeared while I was gone on vacation.  In January I resumed work and the numbing feeling returned in my right food and right hand.  Again, no pins and needles but a numbing feeling. When it would get really bad the tips of my pinky and second last finger would go cold and really hurt.  I was also experiencing concentration issues. This lasted about 6 weeks til mid-Feb when it went away.  About a month later it occurred again in early March.  I got tired of my PCP saying it was anxiety so I took the xanax and while I felt relaxed and it help with the concentration issues it did nothing for the tingling/numbing feeling.  Mid march the numbing stopped altogether however what's persisted is a feeling of my calves and forearms being tight and lightly cramped.  When I wake up in the morning I feel like my calves ran a marathon the night before and they do ease up as I stretch and move thru the day.  My calves fatigue very quickly especially on stairs.  and... I continue to have twitching in my calves (this has been going on since Oct.).  My forearms.... similar. Tight fatigued feeling which makes for stiff hands and sometimes weak hands gripping things, like weights at the gym. As of May (today), I still don't get the numbing feelings however I still get the tight fatigued feeling in my calves and forearms.  The twitching continues 24/7 and now includes the arches of my feet. This twitching is very light and hard to see but it is observable.  I can feel it in the muscle.  Lately in the evenings when I finally sit down after a long day I've started feeling my quad muscles near the connection to the knee spasm very hard 3-4 times. This has been occuring daily and lately in the last 2-3 days I get this feeling in my right thigh of a very fast pulsation (feels very deep in the muscle) in my right thigh side (it can't be seen and only felt).  I still have concententraion issues.  My right eye has apparently started to get lazy since Oct ('15) so I'm having issues focusing and glasses won't fix it.  I'm tired all the time even though I still force myself to the gym to lift weights and cardio daily.  But I have to say its really starting to weigh down on my. I try to ignore it and just go on with my every day life becuase I'm tired of my Dr (GP) telling me he can't find anything wrong with me and constantly repeats anxiety/stress.  I've dealt with stress all my life I know this isnt' stress related.  I just don't know what to do or where to go to come up with answers.

Pulmonary Embolism,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/post-pe-chest-pains-and-shortness-of-breath-693710,Post PE chest pains and shortness of breath,"Forty year old male here. Seventeen months ago I had a big bilateral PE. Been experiencing some chest pains since then, which from reading posts here is not an uncommon experience. The latest bout of chest pains started after Christmas and have been constantly present since then, sometimes worse than others. My cardiologist assures me that because they are not related to exertion they are not heart related. I am on permanent   (dabigatran/pradaxa). Overall I know my health has been downhill, certainly in recent months. The thought of going for a decent walk (even just 4km) has me doubting my ability to manage it without needing a seat half way. A week ago I noticed shortness of breath beginning. At first it wasn't much, and I tried some old   to see if they helped (no). No surprises as the shortness of breath did not feel like  . On Thursday I visited my GP and she did   and renewed my asthma inhalers. Over the course of the week the shortness of breath when doing physically mild activities (like walking around the supermarket) grew to the extent that I feared I might faint a couple of times. On Saturday night I decided that I wasn't happy being at home in this state and drove myself to the emergency department of the local hospital. The staff at the hospital were very attentive and I quickly had ECG, x-ray and MRI. While under rest in the ED my heart rate and blood pressure dropped considerably.  (I note that, unlike my PE, my blood oxygen levels were never a concern.) I was moved to a medical ward overnight, and, because the tests did not show any clot or items of major concern (some evidence of small clots in my lung, but they may be a remnant of my PE and unlikely to be of interest apparently), I was quickly discharged and sent home. The doctor thinks that the   is possibly muscular pain in the chest wall following the PE and not of concern. No explanation is given for the shortness of breath. So, here I am. Very glad to not have a clot, but with no answers for the relatively recent onset of shortness of breath. A walk to the letterbox makes me breathless. Walking to my kitchen to make a cup of coffee is enough. This experience of breathlessness feels very similar to my PE. It seems that the medical hope is that it will improve automatically.

These are ordinary experiences that are part of life and that have nothing to do with disease, except to make it disappear. Even though it did not know what it was meant for, it yielded against better judgment a lesson by having taken psychiatric drugs. This contributed to the level of suffering to make life collapse, which later turned out to be the intention to repay evil with good by asking: who? The idea that 'I' am suffering is exactly that, an idea. Not true. It found out that there was no 'I'. No 'I', so no suffering and therefore no problem. Although there is no 'I' who can complain about anything and the body can take a drug until death, it can try to let this instructive, blessed but useless 'medicine' be.

Cystoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/rigid-cystoscopy-660546,Rigid cystoscopy,"Hey ya’ll, I had an unexpected visit to emergency yesterday following a fall from my bike while out on the track. Long story short I went over the handle bars and landed half on my bike. I took a blow in the tummy just above my boy parts and had immediate sharp pain and shortly after was peeing blood in the toilet. I tried to ignore it for a bit but it was getting sorer so I told dad and we went to the hospital together. They were really good, I had a CT and some pretty good stuff for the pain but not before some doctor made me drop my pants and he had a look and a feel.  They made me p**s into a jar and the urology doc was worried when he saw the blood. After some more waiting he came back and told me he wanted to use a small camera to have a look inside my bladder. I was a bit confused at first what he meant thinking it would be another scan/x-ray type thingy but when he described it I realized he litterally was going to put a camera inside me haha! We were taken to a different room and I was told to have a seat on the bed. 2 nurses came in and asked a bunch more wuestions about stuff before they wrapped a hot blanket around my chest, tucking my arms down by my sides while this guy suddenly grabbed my waist and yanked my jeans and underpants down with no warning! It was quite sudden and embarrasing to be honest. He grabbed my ankles and bent my legs open on the table so my parts were on display. The doc came back in and squirted some cold numbing jelly into my pee hole which felt really weird. He then showed me the camera which to my amazement was huge! Litteraly the size of my finger, i was still in disbelief. By this point dad was holding my hands near my head while the nurse had his hand pressing lightly on my chest. It was all a bit sureall. As a 15 year old  I couldnt think of anything worse then being seen naked in front of a group of people let alone having something forcefully shoved down my penis! The doc said to count to 3 slowely while he grabbed ahold of me with one hand and slipped the camera rod inside my tip and pushed it all the way in.  The pain was sudden and excrutiating, I remember thr nurse putting his hand on my chest and knees to stop me moving. Every time he pushed the camera in a little further he would pull my penis up the scope towards him which made it hurt even more. There was a whole heap of moving the camera up, down, around before he pulled it out and said “all done mate.” He couldnt see any damage. I was wuite teary towards the end. They cleaned me up and let me get up off the table. Next they told me I had to stay overnight so they could keep an eye on the bleeding and they wanted to flush my bladder out as well. After some more waiting dad took me up to my ward bed where i would be staying snd a nurse changed me into a gown and took my clothes away. Another doc came in and told me he was going to have to put a catheter in to flush my bladder out. I couldnt think of snythig worse by now. So eventually with some pursuasion from dad I ended up laying on the bed and letting them shove this little rubber tube down inside, it hurt a little but no where near as bad as the hard camera. They hung a big fluid bag above the bed which drained into the catheter and they put another bag on the end of my tube and hung it off the side of the bed. It constantly felt like I had to pee as all the wash ran into my bladder but the nurse said to try ignoring it.  So I slept over and got a good feed and some more tablets and got woken up every few hours while the nurse came in and emptied my catheter bag. In the morning the doc came around and pulled the catheter out and said I could go home now.  I did some digging around online and found out i had had a rigid cystoscopy yesterday and had a foley catheter left in last night. Its really wuite painful when I pee now and theres still a little blood but its gradually getting better. Doc said it’s likely i bruised my bladder during the fall.  Has anyone else had a rigid and how do you stop the stinging everytime i go to the loo??? -Jordan 0 likes, 11 replies "

Cystoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/cystoscopy-657895,Cystoscopy,"I am a 60 YO male who had a cystoscopy yesterday at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville Fl.  I had a few sleepless nights leading up to the procedure and I can tell you that the fear of the procedure for me was far worse than the actual procedure.  After the urologist’s assistant prepped me by applying  a sanitizer she then inserted a numbing agent through the tip of my penis.  This sounds much worse than it was, albeit a bit embarrassing.  The then asked to relax (easy for her to say) and left and the Dr. came in with her (with another female assistant) after about 15 minutes.  The Dr. had great bedside manners and really put me at ease, explaining exactly what to expect and explaining that he would be inserting water through the scope and I would feel like I was urinating but that was normal.  “Let’s do this” he said, and told me the beginning would be the most painful part.  Before I knew it, he said he was in and this would be super fast.  He turned the monitor so I could watch, and let me see everything he was looking at.  Seeing my prostate was bizarre, he showed me where it was swollen and had a look at my bladder and said everything looked really good except the swelling which is not unusual for a 60 YO.  He removed the scope, and I really had no idea when he did.  The scope was in me for about 2 minutes total.  He thanked me, I returned the thank you, and we spoke after I cleaned up and was dressed.  His assistant told me to expect burning when I urinated for up to 2 days, told me I may pass some blood, and advised me to drink a lot of fluid to wash everything out.  I was a bit uneasy to pee the first time when I got home, but I had absolutely no pain when I did.  I mean zero.  So, for me, by far the worst pain was my own fear of the procedure.  I don’t want to rush out and have it done again anytime soon mine you, but if I have to ever have it done again, I promise you I will sleep fine the night before.  Hope this post helps anyone worried about the procedure. 0 likes, 10 replies "

The infection eventually went away but the pain and uti symptoms have remained EVERY DAY for the past 365+ days. The symptoms are also getting worse- I am getting painful muscle spasms I cant control, abdominal cramps after urinating, and being in the water is basically asking for the worst pain imaginable. STI, yeast infection and all the other stuff has all been ruled out. And I always test negative for a uti. Its now to the point that I cant sit properlyor for long periods of time, or wear normal pants (which is difficult as a premed student). Crossing my legs like a lady is not even an option. My urologist tried to give me a cystoscopy but the emla cream he injected made my urethra feel like a fire pit of death. Instead of addressing my pain he asked if I took medication for anxiety (with which I am not diagnosed). I was dissapointed in him to say the least. No doctor that I have seen seems to know what to do and now my urologist seems to be convinced the pain is all in my head. Even on my calmest day I can have symptoms so bad that even tramadol wont take the edge off. My boyfriend sleeps on the couch at night when we are in school because I cry through the night because of the pain and he cant sleep as a result. My urologist seems to think my symptoms are a result of anxiety but I never had any emotional issues that I am having now until I had endured several months of intolerable pain and sleep deprivation. And despite being on summer vacation with less stress and anxiety inducing events, my symptoms are still worsening. My urologist pretty much refuses to see me until my rescheduled cystoscopy which wont be for atleast 5 months. What else can I do to get the help that I need?  0 likes, 3 replies "

I’m not sure if this horrific pain is normal, I’m on oramorph and even a hot water bottle isn’t getting rid! The only thing the cystoscopy showed was a lot of scar tissue.  I honestly feel like they look at me stupid when i say anything about my pain  .

Cystoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/legitimate-cystoscopy-fears-and-pain-674564,Legitimate Cystoscopy Fears and Pain,"Many patients both female and male have legimate reasons adressing fears when it comes to a variety of invasive medical proceedures. Such fears are not easily addressed in a mdical setting in the fast pace of the hospital arena. You never truly know how Doctors or Nurses are going to respect or consider the reasons for your fears. I believe one of the primary faults of medical professions is respecting ones right to privacy. Not all medical professionals are guilty of this but a lot of them are. And I'm not the only patient who sees this.  In my experience being a heterosexual man who was brutally tortured and gang-raped at gunpoint in the past, its very difficult addressing concerns about fear when invasive medical proceedures arise. Embarrasment, rejection, bias judgment amongst an assortment of other weary issues. I briefly addresed this to a Urologist and female nurse in my hospital room. Assuring me there was nothing to worry about nonchalantly. I went for a scheduled cystoscopy having stayed in hospital for a month from illness of having high fever with a kidney and bladder infection. Upon being placed on a typical hospital stainless steel examination table; the cystoscopy began with the Urologist injesting lidocaine jelly down into my urethra. He didn't wait for the lidocaine to take effect and immediately introduced a long cystoscopy tube. The burning pain was incredible and later subsided as I groaned in pain while he moved the cystoscope around inside my bladder. I don't know what type of cystoscope he used. I was p****d off at him afer and let him know under no uncertain terms. I told him he was a f...ing idiot. He did find four polyps inside my bladder and a blocked kidney ureter. I'm awaiting surgery. I hear so many patients particularly male who claim they never experienced pain during cystoscopy exams. Your the dang lucky ones. 0 likes, 8 replies "

Found some awful posts on the net about it, and then fortunately found many reassuring posts on this forum! Trust me that when the ladies on here say ""Don't worry""....DON'T! I've been so anxious, that I've lost sleep and my appetite over it. I was in and out of Theatre in 7 minutes!  I asked my husband to time it as I knew I wanted to do a review on here to help others, as it has been this forum that got me through it yesterday!  You are in the position for a smear test for the procedure. Knees bent and apart and feet flat and together on the couch. So no stirrups (which I was glad about, as I hate that restriction, and I had expected that!) First they swab the area down, then insert the local anaesthetic. That just feels slightly cold, but not uncomfortable or painful. Then the camera is inserted, and again, that didnt hurt either. The nurse holding my hand told me it was in and then let me watch on the monitor. Whilst the camera is in, the surgeon fills your bladder with water so that he can see it all clearly. Within a couple of minutes, it's all done! I honestly wouldn't even say it was uncomfortable. You are aware something is going on, but certainly no pain. And if the surgeon told me he was going to do another Cystoscopy on me, I wouldnt lose a moments sleep over it!  I was given a cup of tea after the procedure, and sat and rested for a while, and once I had passed urine the nurses discharged me from the ward. I've been passing urine normally and it hasn't even stung, so I guess Ive been lucky. I had no pain until a couple of hours after the procedure, when I guess my anaesthetic had worn off. It was just like Period Pain. I took a couple of Paracetamol and it eased off, and today I am fine.  So trust my post here! I am the biggest softy ever! And if I can do this you can too. Don't lose sleep over it, it's just not worth it! Ignore the horror stories you might come across on the net. It's easier and much less uncomfortable than a smear test! I am happy to help anyone I can over this procedure. If I've missed anything out and you have a question, just post on here and I will get back to you ASAP. Jackie  19 likes, 312 replies "

I had a few side effects to start with like tingling fingers, face and heels but that was bearable, and of course the weight loss which is an added bonus, but the main thing the migraines had all but disappeared. After 2 months he increased my dose, can't remember the strength, but I went from 4 a day to 5.  I then noticed a different problem occurring but didn't associate it with the topiramate.  I started to get a   and bad taste in my mouth and infact my mouth generally felt horrible, normally these symptoms would mean I'm coming down with a cold so I ignored them.  Well after 3 weeks it didn't go away and over the course of 2 weeks I saw 3 GPs who all said there was nothing wrong, to keep me quiet one did some   and the other prescribed me some gastric tablets.  I knew something wasn't right because we all know our bodies and we know when there is something wrong. In the end I checked the side effects for topiramate on the internet and it said you can get sore throats, so as an experinment I dropped 1 tablet a day and the symptoms started to improve slightly but not completely.  After 8 weeks I'd had enough and went back to see my neurologist and told him the story, within 5 seconds he was shouting over me and demanding I stopped taking them immediately, which you wouldn't normally do, he was very concerned and told me I've probably got the start of a condition called Steven Johnson Syndrome which is very, very serious.  I was totally shocked that 3 GPs hadn't put 2 + 2 together when it states on my records what medication I am on.  He has even told me NOT to look it up on the internet as I might be too upset and worried and I have to wait 4 weeks before I can have a blood test to see if I am OK or not.

Has anyone else had these experiences?  I don't know if I should stop topirmate or talk to my doctor first. I'm just afraid of the migraines coming back. 1 like, 1 reply "

So here goe's , I was offshore in June 2016 , & started to experience a sharp but short pain in my gum/tooth , which I put down to dental care , so phoned wife & asked her to make appointment for when I was home , the pain was not regular at the time & I was more than able to live with it with a cple of pain killers . Upon visiting my dentist he could not find any issues with my teeth , so took an exray , which showed nothing , he then asked for a colleague for 2nd opinion , which is were I first heard the term ""trigeminal neuralgia"" , he told my dentist to refer me to specialist , which he did , unfortunatly I was unable to attend my appointment due to working abroad , I did let them know in good time so as to make another , but I was told it may take upto 6/8months for first outpatient appointment .... During this time the pains ie... electric spasms in side of jaw lower/upper right side started to get more intense to a point where if it happend at work I would get a couple of seconds warning via a quivering in my lower lip , so i would try & go somewhere quiet ie toilet or changing room . The trouble was that when working in extreem weather conditions the spasms last for upto 2 hours & in all honesty the intensity of the pain prevents you from talking moving , or anything that would help ..... I was getting desparate by this time & went for help via my GP where he told me he would treat me for TN , & prescribed Carbomazapene , which to be fair took the edge off the pain for about 2/3weeks . I was doing 3:3 rotation at the time , & was due to see neurologist on arrival back home , but 2 weeks into rotation the attacks started back with a vengence lasting 2/3 hours & 3/4 times a day ! I have got quite a high pain threshold but this was the worst thing i've ever experienced .... not being able to move or talk & kicking out with the pain with tears streaming down my face ! I was found by one of the guys i work with & rushed to medical centre on vessel , because the medic couldn't control the pain , it was decided that I should be helivacked off the vessel to nearest hospital ""Emdan"" Germany , where I spent 3weeks of being pumped with morphene & other unmentionable drugs that did absolutaly nothing but make me feel sycotic , having not eaten for over a month i'ed also lost nearly 3 stone ""bad times"" I was eventually transferred to UK hospital & put into acute ward , & placed on emergency list ! 2 weeks later i was treated ""fingers crossed"" successfully with laser treatment to the nerve .... That was 6months ago guys ! I've put the weight back on & started brushing my teeth again ""Yehhhh"" .... back to work next month !

Typical story, started at dentist, before eventually finding my way to neurosurgeon. Diagnosed and started taking Carbamazepine. Carbamazepine effective eliminating pain for the next 10 years. Also had periods of remission. Eventually, Carbamazepine no longer effective.  Eventually tripling dosage and added Baclofen. Due to side effects, stopped Baclofen and added Gabapentin. Tripled dosage of Gabapentin. Still have side effects and unable to completely control pain with medication, so began exploring other options. I am postponing gamma knife, microvascular decompression, and other injections and compression procedures that each come with their own risks.  Discovering that upper cervical technique and acupuncture have helped others, I started search for doctors and licensed professionals with TN experience in my area. While going through upper cervical treatments,    If I turn my head to the left and position it a certain way the pain goes away. I'm not sure if this is a result of the treatment or just me turning and stretching my neck more as a result of the treatment, but I am now able to stop the pain when the triggers occur.  This is not a permanent fix, but relieves the fear I had of having the pain triggered and not having any control over it. In my case, the neck must be turned nearly 75 degrees to the left, so it is not practical to go around life with my neck turned this way.  I do eat this way, since eating is a trigger nearly every time. Not sure exactly why this stops the pain. I continue my upper cervical treatments and will soon begin acupuncture.  I also continue to take medications and remain in contact with my neurosurgeon. I am interested to know if anyone else with TN tried this technique of simply turning the head to stop or prevent TN pain.  I wish I would have tried it 12 years ago for some relief. 1 like, 16 replies "

Trigeminal Neuralgia,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/trigeminal-neuralgia-from-shingles-690214,Trigeminal Neuralgia from Shingles,"Hello everyone.  After 8 long years of shingles, i was left with Trigeminal Neuralgia, TN. I was already on medication for the Post Herpetic Neuralgia, PHN in my right leg, from shingles outbreaks on my right hip but i also had ophthalmic shingles (eye) and was left with pain that no medication gave relief for.  The same meds i used for my leg pain, did nothing for the pain i had on my face, nose, ear, eye, head and teeth. I get electric shocks that bounce around like lightening in a bottle.  At its worst, i often can't eat or talk because when my teeth touched, it is like biting into an electric fence or getting a cattle prod to my head or face bones.  Naturally, i have been hospitalized many times for this pain.  All the docs can do is sedate me for several days at admission, to stop my screaming and allow my body to rest. In the beginning, i was being treated for PHN and docs were baffled why the meds gave relief from my leg but the pain in my head was like a bee hive turned loose inside.  Needless to say, by my third hospital admission, the staff could hear me from the parking lot and my wait time was zero.  I can't recall how many times i was injected while still sitting in the wheelchair. Yes, i was THAT loud. Hospital doctors stayed baffled but between hospital stays, i began to research myself and noticed that most  PHN sufferers were talking about ice packs and cold compresses, to ease their pain, while i was using heating pads, heated rice socks and scalding hot wash cloths to get any relief from the pain in my head. Anything cold lit me up like a really bad Christmas.  Digging deeper, my doctor diagnosed me with TN. At home, we pretty much have the routine down, with heating pads already in place, rice socks being rushed to the microwave and all faucets wide open in the bathroom, to get the hot water flowing faster. Along with this, there's the numbing ear drops, Anbesol on Q-tips and Amitriptyline and Clonazepam.  I do have Vicodin,  Dilaudid and Fentanyl but stopped taking any of them because it does nothing for the TN.  in addition to my wonderful husband and loving son, who are my beautiful medical pit crew at home, i have been blessed to have a wonderful doctor, who truly cares about his patients and takes pain seriously and with compassion.  After 8 years and so many hospital admissions, i can now be sedated at home, with my doctor available by cell phone, if needed.  So, even though i have Trigeminal Neuralgia, i am still truly blessed. I have recently begun a new regimen, under doctors supervision and fingers crossed that it keeps working and i will share it on here, if it succeeds.  I do not want to have surgery, as i fear the worst would result and i take as little meds as i can.  So, any tips would be so much appreciated. I already read someone say on here that ""puffing their cheeks"" helps and i've been doing this, while typing this post, the whole time.  Yes, it DOES work. I wish i knew where i read this great tip, so i could thank them. Thank you...whoever you are.  Any other at home tips would be greatly appreciated. 0 likes, 16 replies "

In 2011, at age 29, I noticed a sharp pain when I brushed my teeth. At the time, like many others, I assumed it was dental related. I went to the dentist and they found nothing wrong. As the weeks went on, the pain started happening when I talked, brushed, washed my face, clenched my teeth, slept, smiled, if the wind blew hard, etc. It was the WORST pain of my life. It felt like an electric shock going off in my the left side of my face by my jaw. Sometimes the pain would be just a quick stab, and other times the pain would vibrate through my face and all I could do was stop all motion and wait until it passed. I would even wake up out of my sleep sometimes from the pain if I accidentally turned on my left side. The pain would last for weeks then go away for a week and I thought it was over. BIG MISTAKE! It came back with a vengeance. After many painful days and nights, I started looking up my symptoms on the internet (yeah for Google) and the same diagnosis kept coming up..Trigeminal Neuralgia. I was confused because although my symptoms matched, it said that this disease usually showed itself in older individuals and I was only 29. I made an appointment with my physician and after cruelly poking my facing with his finger after I told him my symptoms, he confirmed that although it was rare for my age, I had TN. He prescribed me a steroid prescription and sent me on my way. No further explanation. If I had not already researched this, I would have been lost. So I took the pills, and besides making me gain a couple pounds, the pain remained. By now, I had researched so much about TN, I felt like an expert. I called my physician and asked to be referred to a Neurologist. Long story short on this part, Before the Neurologist saw me , he sent me to get MRI which was clean so no MS and he spent all of three minutes seeing me, told me I had TN, gave me a prescription for TEGRETOL, and sent me on my way. No further explanation about my disease. He failed to tell me that the Tegretol would make me CRAZY!!!!!!!!! I am a teacher and the Tegretol had me so nuts, some days I couldn't even function. I have a 2 1/2 yr old and between the Tegretol and pain, I'm sure I was a pain for my child. The Tegretol did help a little but I could not see myself having to live the rest of my life on Tegretol. It would have been HELL!!! I had already researched Gamma Ray treatment and surgery to cut skull open and put something in between nerve and blood vessel. Both did not appeal to me. THIS IS WHEN IT GETS GOOD!!! I live in Alabama (US) and one day when I was researching, I saw that a Neurosurgeon in Birmingham, AL, Dr. Swaid N. Swaid does something called CYBERKNIFE TREATMENT. CYBERKNIFE is a non invasive radio surgery that is used to treat everything from cancerous and non cancerous tumors and TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA!!! It beams a high dose of radiation to the area that precisely goes to the spot needed. I felt like this was my only hope. I called to make an appointment and luckily, a referral was not needed since my Dr. and Neurologist were of no help. I went to see Dr. Swaid the next month and he was the first Dr. to sit down and explain exactly what I had and the treatment options. Because of my age, he thought the brain surgery was better but I told him that I would rather do the Cyberknife. The brain surgery, besides be invasive, would make me have to take 2-3 weeks to recuperate while Cyberknife, I would go into treatment  1-5 times, depending on my xray of my nerves and lay on the table for 45 minutes and left the robot do it's thing and get up and be just fine. No pain, no cutting!  Made my appointment for Cyberknife, went in to talk to Radiologist who told me Cyberknife was just as good as the invasive method. He actually drew me a picture to describe what was going on in my face and told me that I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia in my 3rd trigeminal nerve (the one by the lower jawline). After they looked at my       Xray, they decided I only needed one treatment. They made a mold of my face that is like a net they had to put on my face to keep me prefectly still. I laid on the table, listened to the music of my choice, and listened to the robotic arm buzz over my face for @ 40 minutes. Got up and was on my way. I was warned that the results would not be   immediate. The radiation slowly kills the nerve that is being affected. But month after month, sure enough, the pain became less and less. I went to see Dr. Swaid every 3 month for the next 9 months. He said by the 6th month, if the pain was gone, most likely it would be gone forever. The only side effect I have is that sometimes when I chew on that side of my face, because the nerve was killed, I get a little painless tightening in my jaw (like lock jaw) for a few seconds. I laugh because I'll take that anyday over TN and it only happens usually when I chew something really tough on that side   I have been pain free for about a year now but I'll never forget the worst part of my life. I encourage anyone dealing with TN TO DO YOUR RESEARCH and do what is best for you. If you have a Hospital that offers Cyberknife in your area, I encourage you to look into it. Never give up hope that you can't overcome this and know that there are others that have had to deal with this too....You DO NOT have to settle for taking medication for this disease for the rest of your life! RESEARCH, RESEARCH RESEARCH. God Bless!!! 23 likes, 225 replies "

Trigeminal Neuralgia,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/trigeminal-neuralgia-misdiagnosed--694550,Trigeminal neuralgia misdiagnosed!!!,"About seven years ago, I went to the ER with horrible facial pain. The ER doctor came in and diagnosed me immediately with trigeminal neuralgia, he didn’t do any tests, he just spoke with me in reference to my pain and diagnosed me. Once I was diagnosed, even after visiting multiple neurologist, it was never even talked about whether I might have something else. The pain got so bad over the next couple  of years, that eventually I saw a neurologist in Sarasota and signed up for the decompression surgery. When I was first told about it, it was made to sound very simple. It was so much more than I thought, the numbness that occurred after the surgery was very annoying, and the pain not only did  not go away, but it actually got worse. I saw acupuncturist, ENT doctors, other neurologist, I even went to the Moffitt clinic and spoke with a neurologist because my son is a patient there and they knew what pain I was going through. The Neuro surgeon at Moffitt refused to discuss a second surgery with me because he could see no indication of the nerves hitting on my  MRI. They knew I was in pain he just felt that a second surgery without better indication of the trigeminal was out of the question. He had done both my sons brain surgeries for his cancer and so I completely trusted him. However, my pain continued to be horrible, I was in so much pain, I could barely lick my lips. It hurt to drink water. I couldn’t speak,  it obviously affected my work. I then went to a neurologist who was doing the surgeries at  another hospital in Gainesville. The neurologist there read my file, and quickly determined that I should have surgery again. I sat in his office crying, asking if there was any possible way I did not have trigeminal neuralgia? Since the first surgery  didn’t work, was it at all possible it could be something else? His response, was that the first surgeon just did not do it right. I then agreed, even though I was rather anxious, which is totally not me, to  have a  Second surgery. Again, I came out of the surgery in more pain, if that was even possible, then before I went in. I continue to suffer for at least another year, dealing with my sons cancer it was hard to put much time into my issue. However, at one of my sons appointments, the doctor up there suggested I go see a specialist that treats and trigeminal neuralgia at John Hopkins University Hospital in Maryland. I called, the doctor read my file and agreed to see me  my husband and I flew up there, and went and saw the neurologist there, who after speaking with me looking at all my information, enlighten me that he felt I had been misdiagnosed. He wondered why from day one I was never sent to see an oral surgeon? And all the times I asked every doctor, everywhere, not one person suggested I see an oral surgeon. I went to every doctor, every institution, that any physician had suggested  with the hopes that I would find some relief for my pain. Obviously, had I been sent to an oral surgeon I would have went. I flew back to Florida, made an appointment with an oral surgeon in Bonita Springs, he shook his head, said he never heard a story like mine. They fitted me with this outrageously expensive mouthpiece, and the pain went away. I was on the highest dose of gabapentin and carbamazepine you could take a day,  I couldn’t remember peoples names, dates, the basic information because my poor head was so fogged over from the medication. The oral surgeon told me I had the worst case of TMJ possible. I should’ve had my jaw broken, my teeth aligned, I am in my 50s, and he said because my alignment is so bad that’s what started the pain. I wear this brace all the time,  we have still talked about breaking my jaw etc., but right now I am not in any pain. I do not take any medication whatsoever. I also removed most carbs, and gluten from my diet mostly because I wanted to lose weight, but it appears it has also helped. Anything that involves any inflammation, does have some direct connection to all those nerves in there so of course it didn’t hurt.  I encourage everyone to see your oral surgeon, and see a really good one, one with a lot of experience who has seen a lot. After my second brain surgery, the numbness is all along the right whole side of my face, part of my lip, and part of my tongue. It goes up behind my ear. Obviously it was never even necessary.  I wish everyone the best of luck with your situation, please be sure you are diagnosed correctly from the beginning. Once that ER doctor labeled me as trigeminal neuralgia, my symptoms fit that profile, no one would even consider it wasn’t something that I had. To me, I feel like I’ve been through a miracle. Best of luck to every one Donna 0 likes, 2 replies "
Trigeminal Neuralgia,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/need-help-in-asking-the-right-questions-confused--693438,Need help in asking the right questions! Confused!,"Hello everyone, I need help and I am confused. Last Oct. I went to see Endodonist because I was having pain and thought it was either a root canal problem or a cracked tooth.  Dr. kept questioning me about the cold pressure and what hurt more. I was frustrated because after paying for xrays and nothing major showing up he told me to call him when I would have extreme pain and come in.  Well, wanting not to waste his time or mine I chose to wait and take tylenol or ibuprofen when  I would feel some kind of pain. It's Feb. 7th and the fifth day of pain I went back yesterday because the pain was overpowered by sharp and throbbing feeling. I felt like I was going to faint and throw up because of this pain on my left side of face.  I was glad to finally have this pain that surely the guy could see the problem. To my dismay, after x-rays  and him trying to see where the pain was coming from, he told me that he did not believe my teeth were a problem. I started to tear up because I did not understand what or how this pain is happening at different times and sparadicully. I told him I felt like I sounded like a crazy person. He has sent me home with muscle relaxers and wants to see me in a week before he refers me to someone else. It's the next day and I started early this morning with sharp pain spasms and all day at work total discomfort. The spasms did not occur all day but I have been taking Tylenol/Ibuprofen all day. What kind of questions should I ask Dr. if he decides that i'm fine? Does anyone know why he would give me another week to see him before he decides his next decision. He has allready told me it is not my teeth. I feel confused about all this but mostly the past week has been painful and I am extremely tired when I get home from work .  Tonight, after my second muscle relaxer  I am starting to feel better but hate that it has taken this to help me sleep! Can anyone share your first experiences so that I can try to understand and try to see if this is where I'm headed. I know it is not TMJ because the constant pain sometimes consecutively and so sharp that it makes me want to cry, and that is with overcounter meds in my system tells me something is not right.  I'm 56 years old woman and a receptionist at a hospital and this past week has been the worst. Sorry, for so many words but it's so hard to explain. Thank you in advance for any input!

Anyway after my basic tooth filling work 3-4 days after i feel extreme pain on my tooth and x ray shows nothing wrong my teeth(Upper left back teeth) i and my jaw surgeon(dentist) decided to make root canal because i was really panic and the pain was the worst. i said just do that or i went blackout because of pain.  Then after operation my teeth seems good and just a little pressure pain on it.(still in progress but not really much.) 1 weeks after i have burning on my left cheek which is maxillary region and i had burning tongue tip very boring type.  I google it and I used a b-complex for my burning pain and it seemed a good for me my burning sensation gone 75 %. ( Still in progress.) After 2 days my dentist called my and advice to check my sinus i went ENT and everythink seems OK. 3.month : My dull ache pain really gone bad when i was on cold weather. Really sucks. I also have a weird symptom which my left back of my tongue  pains when i touch it or swallowing. Like a tongue wound. I also had a little earache. Gone again Ent everything normal again. 4.month: I went a brain surgeon give me a lyrica(2x25 a day) and another neurologist which is good at this cranial nerve issues. All them said that it is not a typical neuralgia maybe atypical because of tongue pain and continuous pain. 5.month: I decided to take lyrica because of my tongue ache pain and tingling root of my tongue. Tingling also cause sometimes coughing. Lyrica not seem working for my tongue pain. For face burning and ache its really good but not for my tongue still same. 6.month:  Okay my tongue prickling pain gone back more now and much more pain when i pressure on it.

I can't swallow thinks like water or meal. It's okay specially after evening i can eat. But until the evening i can't eat. I give 7 kilos in 2-3 months. My tongue problems gone interestingly. I feel my problems traveling my cranial nerves. I went my neurologist again and made a brain mri with contrast. Nothing seems a abnormal just a artery touch on my trigeminal nerve. My neurologist really can't do anything. Maybe Glossopharyngeal nerve problems she suspected but not sure. She send me a rheumatologist and made some tests. My ANA comes really high positive. But all other tests come negative. He thinks it can be a mix connective tissue disease. Not give me to a medicine just continue to take lyrica. Also he can't explain swallowing problems and MCTD. Just say come after 4 months and see your ANA score again. I am really tired to can't find my problems.I try to sum up but i saw about 10 neurologist, 3 brain surgeon, 2 Ent,1 Endo and 1 Rheumatologist.

And now the neurologist can see why too, and she's getting the surgeon involved, my hope is that by the end of the year, the issue with this loop in my brain will be sorted out and I might be on the road to recovery.

I had some very very dark thoughts that I haven't had in years. I took the tramadol and felt ten times better. I have a doctor's appointment today, but they tend to be as much use as a chocolate teapot. Any recommendations or information you think will be helpful to take with me is greatfully appreciated.  A nurse over the phone expressed she thought that the time frame for coming off them was too short, and the leap from 100mg to none was too much. Please help. I know I have a problem, but I'm scared to come off them and become the horrid, nasty person I was at the weekend. My rational thoughts tell me once I stop for good I'll be back to normal, but I don't have those rational thoughts when I try and come off them. I need them to cope with the most simple of tasks. 16 likes, 379 replies "
Tramadol,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/stay-away-from-tramadol--34978,Stay away from Tramadol!,"Last Friday (16/Sep/11) I had an op to repair an umbilical hernia (overnight stay). On being discharged the nurse gave me a packet of 50mg Tramadol capsules to ease the pain, although the pain wasn't that bad. I had been walking to the toilet (in hospital) within 4 hours of recovering from the op. Anyway, I got home on Saturday and what with the fairly long walk from the hospital to the taxi, plus getting in and out of the car, I was starting to feel some twinges, so I took 2 Tramadol. Much later that evening I started to have really weird side effects. They are so difficult to describe. A combination of panic attack, dizziness, extreme fatigue, and difficulty nodding off to sleep. I'd nod off, like one does, then I'd immediately have these images in my head - people I'd seen on TV that day, cars, animals, all jumbled up.  Then I must have fallen asleep for an hour or two only to come awake with a start after having this veritable nightmare of there being someone in the room and when I opened my eyes (in my sleep just before coming awake) there was this extremely tall guy, 9 feet tall, his head was literally brushing the ceiling. Then \""he\"" walked across the room to another bed (my mind thought it was still in the 4-bed unit in the hospital ward) and disappeared! As if in a puff of smoke. And at that point I awoke feeling hot and sweaty. So those were the last Tramadol *I* was ever going to take, I can tell you. And then, yesterday, Thursday I had severe itching at the surgical wound site. This had nothing to do with the Tramadol I'd taken on Saturday, which must have been out of my system by then. Anyway, apart from the itching there was still a bit of an ache, so I thought I'd take just a single Tramadol capsule. The itching went; the dull ache went. But this morning, very early, about 04:00am, I awoke feeling anything but refreshed. I had some numb feelings in my hand and thigh, they kept coming and going. I got up at around 05:45am, make a cup of tea, then suddenly felt very weak. Jittery, fast pulse, zonked. Since then I have just lain on my bed in between going for a short walk and am drinking glasses of water in an attempt to flush this [b:095f76e716]POISON[/b:095f76e716] out of my system and am starting to feel a little better. Earlier in the week on doctor's recommendation I booked an appointment with the nurse for this afternoon to have the dressing changed and the incision checked (it's a long, vertical cut about 4 inches long; they found  two hernias), and in order to save on taxi fares I booked one of the free pick-up buses to take me and bring me back. However, I've just cancelled them and have ordered a taxi instead as I cannot face the lengthy zig-zag route these buses often take as they have to pick up numerous other people. I'll talk to the nurse about Tramadol and see what she says. I don't need any pain killers now and if I still get one or two twinges in the next few days, I shall take only paracetamol if necessary. (Not allowed to take ibuprofen or similar NSAIDs as I have a tendency to gastritis and duodenal ulcer.) So, I am never going to touch Tramadol ever again and this time I mean it. I would not recommend it to my worst enemy. If some people take it just to get \""high\"" they must be stark, raving mad. 5 likes, 53 replies "

I used sound imitators for the ringing,whooshing sound(crickets) and the pulsing (heart beat) to help me sleep. You can find sounds that help on youtube. I then started trying different relaxant and sleeping medication.  I finally found that a combination of amitryptiline and Immovane are working for me to sleep a good nights sleep.  It is only starting to ease now (i.e. end of July) after 2 weeks of this combination plus the sounds.  I also meditate and sought counselling, read the bible, prayed and had many pray for me. In counselling I was told either to try to distract myself from the worrying or to think it through whichever works. Hopefully this helps you. 3 likes, 2 replies "

I was tested showing significant loss 8 years ago but vanity prevented me from using the (expensive) aids I purchased. I recently got checked and fitted with aids through the NHS as live in Wales although audiograph showed no changed when compared to the previous. I was never tested as a child but struggled in class and all life have had a loud buzzing in both ears. Complaints of ear ache and fuzzy ears was put down to just that and as young adult was told by gp that my ears looked fine and was prob due to wax and given drops. I thought that it must be the same for everyone tho wondered why I really struggled to watch tv or make out dialogue when went to the cinema as I could hear. I thought maybe was a bit slow catching on to things tho managed get a good degree in further education (with much time spent copying up). I've since learned the noise is and was tinnitus which has always been a constant so am used to it and first test showed I had moderate to severe loss in both ears but so far I'd somehow managed. I'd kinda learned my own language along with self learned lip reading so these aids are taking some getting used to as nothing sounds like I thought. The recent test was conduvpcted by my now chosen audiologist and he explained the audiograph and said that it indicated that I'd more than likely been born with it considering the lifelong tinnitus and history. However, although I did struggle, I had 2 severe bouts of glandular fever in my teens and the secon time totally lost my voice for a few weeks and also went almost totally deaf and the tinnitus went so loud it felt that that's why I couldn't hear anything. That infection seemed to last for about 3 months and gradually the noise reduced and I started to get some hearing back. I've always felt that it did cause possible further hearing loss especially in my left ear tho both go down to around 70-75db  in the mid frequencies then the left ear does right down and the other back up in high frequency range. Tinnitus has always been constant but now even tho I'm using aids it seems to drown out everything and have to really concentrate at times to work out conversation and tv etc. It's a whole lot better as I can enjoys cinema and socialise a lot more but just wondered if having those infections could have worsened things cos when I was younger I seemed to just accept it. I just wondered if those infections had an impact and if anyone had anything simelar happen after that particular infection. Suppose and just trying suss out cause/reason as I certainly questioned my hearing and the loud buzzing as started to realise not everyone had it and that no one in my family needed to use aids. Am a bit new to all this really through ignorance so am grateful for any info and also what I've already had from others thanks and apols for lengthy message (I drive my mates crazy with lengthy texts).  Julia 😻🐈🐾🐾🐾   1 like, 0 replies "

My wife was recently prescribed HRT medication and after taking the drug for a short period now has tinnitus. 21 years ago she suffered similarly and was successfully medicated. We think it was the drug Nortriptyline but unfortunately her medical records from that era have not survived. She has today consulted her GP who frankly seemed to have no idea of how to help her. She mentioned that she thought she had been successfully treated with Nortryptoline and she has now been prescribed this. However, we are still concerned as to whether this treatment is appropriate at this stage and do not wish to inadvertently make things worse. She is not severely depressed but is suffering   as a result of prolonged menopausal issues and now tinnitus.  Would really appreciate the thoughts of anyone else, particularly those who have been prescribed Nortryptyline. We feel that after her taking HRT and only attaining a new ailment that we are lurching from one crisis to another and as the GP provided no real reassurance we would love to hear thoughts from others who suffer similarly. I am absolutely desperate to help my wife so would very much appreciate any help you can provide. Thanks you so much in anticipation of your replies. Paul 1 like, 2 replies "

Has anyone else been told this before? They say minimum 6-8 weeks, no longer than a year. I'm really struggling to live with this, and I will never accept it if it is permanent. If it is still here in 5 years time I won't be here anymore. It is noise induced by the way: I was listening to music pretty loud with new headphones, FLAC format which means lossless audio, for just under an hour, when the fire alarm went off. I am in uni halls so I have a fire alarm in my room. I could hear the fire alarm whilst the music was still playing directly in my ears. I took off the headphones and went outside. When I came back in I didn't notice the ringing in my ears if it was there. So, I continued to listen to music through my headphones for 20 minutes or so. When I finally decided to go to bed I took the headphones off and straight away noticed the ringing. Having heard it before for a few seconds/minutes after music, I thought nothing of it and assumed it would go in the morning. I woke up, and it was there. I was incredibly anxious and all the rest of it, here I am today, having been told it will go one hundred percent and will last no longer than a year. I should be positive right? but I am not - I can't stop worrying that this is permeant and will be one of those people that has to learn to accept it will be there for life and get on with it. Well, I am not prepared to live with this for the rest of my life, and yes, people do live with MUCH worse i.e. no legs, arms, sight, hearing, etc, but I simply will not live with this if it is permanent. Therefore, I have decided to give it 5 years. The doctors say no longer than 1 year so I shouldn't even consider that but I am just that anxious and it is bothering me that much that this is what is has come to.

It all started in late pregnant with my first child, it wasn't constant and mainly when exercising or bending, doctors said very normal due to increased blood flow and that it would go.  It never went and became constant after I had my baby two weeks late via c section. It is there 24 hours a day and can sometimes become so loud I can hardly hear anything else, it's a clear thumping sound of my blood flow(completely in time with my pulse) and increases during exercise. It sounds like a bass drum! I can also feel it pumping away when it gets bad.  From my research it seems everything says it is almost always vascular in nature, with many scary causes. However my GP and ENT are dismissing this as regular tinnitus. There is a clear difference. I had an MRI of my ears and a hearing test, all fine. I'm worried it is a problem with an artery in my neck or brain etc, I know I am young but I smoked since teenage years quite heavily and only quit when I conceived.  It is far worse in the morning when waking it's unbearable. I feel like a walking blood vessel and I'm scared I'm going to have a stroke)/heart attack.  How do i get my GP to listen, they know I'm very anxious about this but I don't think they're taking me seriously how much it's affecting my life, if it were regular tinnitus I understand that a cause is difficult to find or treat, but this isn't regular tinnitus and I'm worried.

I'm struggling to type and write, as my cognitive abilities are straining, lacking. I feel as though I lost 40 IQ points in the last year. I struggle with memory, I'm very weak and extremely exhausted. I have had previous surgeries to have cysts removed. Hysterectomy at 28. Appendix at 16, Gall bladder removal at 38. which all made me very sick. Now that I'm 45, I can say I have never been so I'll. About 4 years ago, I went to the ER, as I was weak and very ill. Blood Tests confirmed mono, but I was told I had a node on my Thyroid which was very small and I shouldn't be concerned, most people have these and are fine. I was also told I had Deginerative disc disease at the same time. The Thyroid node was very concerning to me, as my mother passed away from her node, her node also metastasized into her lungs. she was scheduled for surgery to remove said node, the morning she passed away.  As you can see, the node bothered me. In the county I live in, there are only 3 Endocrinologists in my area and set up an appointment as soon as possible, which was 4 months away.  I finally went in, he performed an ultrasound and even though I stated my concerns over family history. He said there was no need to worry, no need for further testing, it was too small to remove, and so we are going to monitor ever 6 months. Each follow-up appointment, was the same discussion. No need to worry, it's growing, but growing slowly. no worries. No Testing, see you in 6 months. After my last appointment 13 months ago, he said I will see you next year. It's growing so slowly, we can now see each other once per year. After the first initial visit with the endocrinologist, I seemed to never get over mono it seemed. Constantly sick to my stomach, tachycardia episodes. Migraines, losing my vision, throbbing behind my eyes. Throbbing pain that would come and go. 6 months after meeting the Endocrinologist, started hospital stays. My triglycerides were high at 2600. My blood pressure was sky high.

Later with a hernia right side, upper stomach and hernia where my stomach is going into my lung area. Through the last 4 year's I've been treated like a hypochondriac, because I'm sick.

I want to stick a hanger down my throat to remove the blockage, I'm desperate for relief. I have horse voice, lose my voice and always clearing my throat, and I never ask for pain medication, because then I would be a drug attic. I did ask for prednisone but was denied. I have to have help to the bathroom, I never leave my home now and my consists of taking medicine and just keeping water down. I have another ultrasound on Thursday, but I feel like it's pointless. I'm tired of arguing with everyone. I use a walker to get around, but ready to use wheel chair full time, I'm so weak.

So I went to endocrinologist who told me that should have a couple more things checked. So all in all: My levels are: Tsh: 5.4 (0.35-4.20) FT 3: 3.36 (1.90-4.40 pg/ml) FT 4: 1.26 (0.93-1.71 ngram/dl) Anti TPO: <5.00 ( ❤️4 IU/ml) Anti TG: 18.46 ( <115 IU/ml) Also my cholesterol levels were a little higher than normal: 207 (max is 200) This mainly started due to high level stress and it really affected my gut. Never really had diarrhea and maybe some constipation but my bowel changes were inconsistent.I also used to have a lot of bloating which has disappeared somehow.I have also been having issues with my sleeping schedule and maybe 2-3 times a slight heartburn.Im gonna have another meeting with the endocrinologist in about 2 weeks but until then maybe someone here who has had something similar or knowledge of thyroid issues can help me understand.

I'm a 34 year old female and I just want to share my story with others who might be trying to decide whether or not to have a total thyroiodectomy after getting a thyroid nodule biopsy and they found ""atypical"" cells and did not get a definite answer one way or the other if it was cancer.  I was unsure of what to do when my endocrinologist suggested I have my whole thyroid removed even they they weren't definitely sure it was cancer (which I initially thought was seriously overreacting).  I came to the internet first trying to find others with symptoms and stories of the aftermath and that helped me feel a little more comfortable with my decision.  I hope this will help others with their decision.  I am not an expert on this in any way.   I had goiter, several nodules, hyperthyroidism, and Hashimotos.  My endocrinologist monitored my thyroid with blood tests and ultrasounds evey 6 months to a year for about 6 years which started right before I got pregnant with my first child.  I was never put on any medication for it as my levels were never really crazy and I thought I felt ok. (Looking back I did have lots of hyperthyroid symtoms that I thought were a result of being pregnant for 18 out of 26 months and then having two kids under 3- occasional tiredness, irritability, brain fog, weight gain, etc...and then I didn't really notice when this didn't go away even after my son turned 6)   Then one ultrasound of my thryroid found a nodule with a calcium deposit on the left side (possible cancer indicator) and I had a fine needle biopsy (FNA).  They found ""atypical cells: which was neither a definite yes or no that there was cancer.  My endocrinologist suggested I remove the whole thyroid gland.  I was like whoa, slow down, that means I'll be on medication for the rest of my life and we don't even know if it really is cancer, and why can't we just take out half?  Here was her reasoning: 1. I had already been having issues with my thyroid and getting repeated ultrasounds for 6 years (that I knew of-I didn't have health insurance in college), and the nodules were getting a tiny bit bigger (fractions of a cm) every time and would eventually choke me even though it might be 10 years down the line. 2. If it was cancer, it was good to catch it early before it got entangled in something they couldn't get it off of or might damage if they tried, or before it spread to other tissues depending on what type it was.  3. At this point if they got it before it spread I could avoid possible radiation/chemo. 4. Once they got me on the right dosage of Synthroid or some other thyroid meds I would be fine 5. It might help me be able to lose weight easier-I had recently lost a total 40 lbs over a year and a half and it was very slow going.  6. Why remove all instead of just the half with the suspicious nodule? Eventually the other half will need to come out once the nodules get bigger or I develop cancer in that half and why do I want to do surgery twice and might as well get it done while I'm younger and healthier instead of possibly when I'm older and can't recover as quickly. She could still sense my uncertainty so she suggested I talk to the surgeon who had done hundreds of these surgeries.  He told me what he would do was take out the left half and   he would take it to the pathologist to have it looked at and determine if it was cancerous, and if it was, then he would take out the whole thing. He would also inspect the right half to determine if it was worth saving. I believe there was a warning somewhere about other tissues having to be removed but of course I didn't really pay attention to that at the time. Ultimately, I decided to have the surgery, which ended up being 3-4 hours long (I was told it would be a couple of hours with probably 2 day stay in the hospital after).  Still groggy after the surgery I asked what they took and they ended up removing the whole thyroid and one (out of 4) parathyroid glands - which my surgeon referred to as enlarged and ""really nasty"".  He said my right lobe was too diseased to be worth keeping in there as I would eventually need it out and it could develop cancer.  It was enlarged and full of nodes and obviously Hasmiotos.  Instead of wasting time then with the pathologist they waited for him to do a complete pathology report after freezing and slicing all of the specimens, which I received about a week after the surgery which would tell me if there was cancer. First couple of days post surgery I was groggy and wasn't very hungry, but didn't have much pain at my incision site, mostly my throat was sore from the tube they put in my throat while I was under.  Then the hypocalcemia set in and I started getting some tetany (like when you get tetanus)-my hands were almost frozen into claws, and I couldn't really open them and my face was feeling numb, and my legs would get kind of numb easily.  Needless to say, there went the 2 day stay.  I was in the hospital for 10 days.  My doctor said that the parathyroid that they removed was enlarged and probably pumping out lots of hormone compared to the other 3 which probably shrank a bit and they slowed down their production due to the enlarged one.  So when the large one was removed, the other 3 were very sluggish and not producing enough parathyroid hormone to keep up my calcium levels.  When they checked my calcuim, I was at a 6.1 and normal was above 9 or something and this was really low and if it continued to get lower my heart could stop.  So they started me on an almost continuous calcium drip and Oscal, rocalcitrol, Magnesium Oxide, stool softener (because all of the calcium pills and drip can seriously back you up), and the first of the rest of my lifetime of Synthroid.  The synthroid is a very tiny pill that you must take early in the morning on an empty stomach.  I would get my blood drawn 3 times a day (6am, 2pm, and 10pm) to monitor my calcium and tons of other stuff.  Also, I was told the calcium drip is hard on the veins, so my IV had to be moved to a different spot 6 times because my vein would ""blow"".  3 to 4 days post surgery I started to get stomach pain and was nauseous and didn't want to eat or see any food.  I was told this was due to all the calcium irritating my stomach.  Once my calcium levels started to go up and they spread out the number of calcium pills I was taking at at time (4 times a day instead of 3) it got a little better but I still couldn't eat much.  One day post surgery I was able to walk around, but I would be so exhausted after and I slept a lot.  I finally got my pathology report and they did find paillary carcinoma (thyroid cancer!) in the right side-yeah the side I did not have biopsied.  Luckily, it looked like it remained within the margin of the thyroid although it was really close to edge, but it didn't look like it spread.  My surgeon suggested I take a radioactive Iodine pill that would kill any thyroid tissue that remained, and he said there are always some small pieces of thyroid tissue that stay stuck to my larnyx, and blood vessels that they just can't get because they might damage that important stuff.  He said that would be up to my endocrinologist, though.  So finally, I got out of the hospital after 10 days.  I was still extrememly lethargic and sleeping a lot, but I was able to eat a little more.  About 2.5 weeks post surgery, my energy level started gradually increasing, and I got my appetite back.  I am very gradually getting weaned off the calcium pills and have to have a blood test weekly to test my level.  I saw my endocrinologist and she actually DID NOT recommend the radioactive iodine pill.  She said statistically, I had a lower chance of my thyroid cancer recurring than I did of developing a different kind of cancer from the radioactivity in the iodine pill.  She said she'd take her chances with thryoid cancer (very treatable, low mortality rate, especially if caught early) as opposed to developing something like leukemia or some other cancer elsewhere in my body.  Of course, they would continue to monitor my thyroid area with 3 to 4 ultrasounds a year for possibly the next couple of years and hopefully if nothing continues to show up, they would gradually reduce it to once a year.  If the thyroid cancer pops up again, we can always do the radioactive iodine then.  So I am about 3.5 weeks post surgery and my scar is healing nicely (about 5 inches across) and once it fades, it won't hardly be visible.  My energy levels are gradually increasing and I am gradually feeling more normal.  I'm taking one less calcium pill and I am only taking them 3 times a day now.  Overall, I'm glad I had the surgery, especially since they did find the cancer and the diseased parathyroid gland.  While post surgery was a little rough and I thought I was miserable at the time, I'm sure having chemo and radiation if the cancer had spread would have made me much more miserable.  If you're facing similar decisions and issues I hope this helps!  Good luck and may God Bless you! 2 likes, 21 replies "

Luckily when I went back that next month my levels were good and I was cleared for surgery! That was a happy moment! So on Nov. 3rd I had my surgery, which went fantastic.  It was however 6 hours long, the surgeon said my thyroid was a lot bigger than he expected, 10 cm on each side, and was so tight it was like it was glued to my neck.  I woke up without any pain and have recovered beautifully since.  The only thing is my  , which was originally a lovely side effect of my disease, has been on full blast.  I started a new job last week, but it gave me massive panic attacks so I had to quit.  I don't know if this will eventually calm down the more I take the synthroid or if this is going to be my new norm.  I am currently on anxiety medicine, I have been on it since August and my doctor just uped my dose right after my surgery cause the old dose wasn't working.  I am constantly worrying about stupid stuff, but for the most part I still feel fine.  It just comes and goes.  I've always known I've had some type of anxiety problem, but this is on a whole new level.  I need to be working, but I'm afraid that I won't be able to shake the anxiety and I'm going to have to suffer through it.  Can anyone tell me when this should calm down or if they had a similar story? By the way when I say that for the most part I feel fine and the anxiety comes and goes I should ellaborate.  I am constantly worrying about something, things that probably won't even happen, but I still feel normal.  It's not crippling or anything.  The only time it got really bad was when I started that new job.  It was a serving job and I wasn't comfortable at all with how they ran things there.  So maybe it was just that situation??? Once I decided to quit and I told my manager I felt like my old self again...just the little worry wart I always was.  0 likes, 19 replies "

Still there was this song I listened to a lot cos I liked it. At home I always listen to songs without headphones. But a few days after me listening to it these hallucinations appear. I don't know why. I read it's very often because of hearing loss but I have none. I do have anxiety and some depression sympthoms. Right now I am burnt out as well.

I'm 23 and female and have occasionally felt an itch in the past but it has only ever been for a day or so and then goes away, so I assumed that this was due to something I'd eaten. This time the itch didn't go away in a day or two, and to my horror I saw a threadworm when wiping about 3 days ago. I managed to get some Ovex on Tuesday (2 days ago) and have taken my first dose. I saw a further 3 on tuesday (2 on my bum and 1 I found crawling nearer to my v hole which I find very worrying). I haven't seen any since and haven't really felt itchy either. I have changed bedsheets and have been washing down there morning and night and some times in between because I feel gross. I have been washing my hands so frequently they're in a constant state of dryness and redness after only a few days! I've started having garlic and Apple cider and eating pumpkin seeds because I want these gone immediately! After reading many forum posts here I have a few questions as I'm really worried about them invading other body parts. I'm also worried about having them forever! I remember having an itchy bum sometimes as a child but I've never seen these little worms before! If you've had them in your v - how did you know they were there? Can medication reach there? Can you still have sex (obviously not oral)? If you've had them in your nose/ears - again, how did you know? After reading many posts here I feel itchy and freaked out. What usually happens after taking medication? I haven't seen any coming out in my poop since taking the Ovex but my itching has almost gone. I thought they would come out?

Threadworm,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/so-i-m-confused-658639,So I’m confused,"So I went to see my doctor yesterday morning  because I was at my wits end with this discomfort. I got advice from someone on here to apply baby powder to my anus to kill eggs and stop itching. I did that the day before my appointment and it helped.  The powder definitely helps with the itching/tingling. It gives me pretty much Instant and long lasting relief.  When I showed the doctor some photographs of minuscule white fibres I find occasionally by my back passage she told me they were not worms and seemed certain with this conclusion. I have also showed my mother, with 3 children she would know what threadworms look like and also reassured me that they are not worms. I am inclined to believe them as they do not resemble the google representation of what worms are known to look like and the discomfort is present during the day and barely noticeable at night if present at all, and does not occur in a cycle. I have been taking Ovex like sweets over the last few months, following the strict hygiene recommendations, to no avail as I was still itching up until the BP recommendation. I am still paranoid. I felt a sense of relief following the appointment because the BP has pretty much eliminated that irritating feeling (for now) but I’m so far gone now that I feel my brain is fixed in this state of putting any discomfort back there down to worms that it’s still making me low, I did a Bowel movement earlier in the day and tore myself up in the process, so now it stings and burns and I can feel a slight throbbing, the BP does help, and I know it’s just another   but my mind is getting me in a state. I applied more BP and behold another tiny tiny white fibre. You can barely see them, they’re pretty much invisible if the angle isn’t perfect, so unless this is a new breed of evolved TW I have no clue what they are...As they do not wriggle. If not worms What is it that I am seeing? I am at a loss.   0 likes, 7 replies "
Threadworm,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/signs-you-might-not-have-threadworms-451959,Signs you might not have threadworms,"DON'T BELIEVE ALL THE HORROR STORIES THAT SAY ""ONCE YOU GET   YOU HAVE THEM FOREVER"". THIS IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. I thought I had threadworms 3 times, and I spent several months of my life going crazy trying to get rid of them. It turns out I was actually making the problem worse, and I'm so glad I found out the real cause, because otherwise I could have carried on that way forever. Here are some things I learned that I think are worth sharing, so hopefully other people don't go through the same thing I did. Signs you might not have threadworms: 1) You feel them crawling during the day and not just at night. 2) Other people in your family don't catch them or don't feel them. 3) You have repeatedly taken the medication and been through the hygiene measures and it seems to have little or no effect. 4) You have not actually seen a definitive living threadworm, and you have tried doing tape tests, for example even right after you feel them crawling. In my case, the cause of the crawling feeling was actually overwashing. I expect this is common problem in association with threadworms. See, I did originally have a threadworm infection (a year and a half earlier), and that made me become obsessive about washing my bottom. After reading the horror stories here, I wanted to make sure I completely got rid of them. I would spend at least a couple of minutes just washing around my anus to make sure no threadworm eggs got left behind. It turns out that washing so thoroughly, with soap, makes the skin in this area super-sensitive, and it starts tickling occasionally for no reason. And that tickling feels EXACTLY like threadworms. I swear it is indistinguishable. A conversation I had with my mum, when I still thought I had threadworms and she suggested that it might just an itch. I responded with: ""It's not an itch, I can feel it crawling out and across my skin. I KNOW what threadworms feel like. I first found out I had them BECAUSE I could feel them, it was only afterwards that I saw one. I've never had that feeling before then, ever in my life. So I know this is them again, because there's nothing else that would cause a sensation like that."" Turns out I was wrong! It honestly can feel like they are crawling 'out and across your skin' even when they are not. Other thoughts: * All the scientific studies say that threadworms come out only at night, e.g. after 9 pm. I believe this is correct. * A few people have asked how quickly mebendazole works, and how effective it is. I don't know for definite, but I personally believe it kills worms quickly (within 5 days), and is probably close to 100% effective. This is because my own feelings of having worms changed from nighttime-only to daytime within a few days, and so I think it is quite common for the over-sensitive skin thing to kick in quickly once you start washing to get rid of the threadworms. What I would do if I ever thought I had threadworms again: 1) take the mebendazole once a week for a few weeks (6 at maximum) 2) make sure I don't wash too thoroughly after the first few weeks, and get an emollient-based soap-substitute (available from a pharmacist, usually used for eczema). 3) go and see a doctor if it didn't go away. My problem went away within a couple of days after I stopped over-washing. I hope this helps other people, and if it does, please, PLEASE come back and post to say so. Or if it doesn't work, or you disagree with me, or you don't believe me, you're welcome to post that too. I feel like this forum has become over-run with scare stories and unhelpful advice, and nobody seems aware of other possible causes for threadworm-like symptoms. 1 like, 46 replies "

Threadworm,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/long-term-threadworms-i-think-i-have-found-a-solution-34679,Long term threadworms - I think I have found a solution,"6 months ago I suddenly realised that my children and I were infested with threadworms and had been for at least a year prior to that. It has caused me intermittent, unexplained diarrhoea attacks and obviously itchiness. I had put the latter down to thrush as I obviously had them in my vagina. I also had unbearable itching at the top of my bottom (near the small of my back). This has been so distressing, and the information I have found on the internet has been frustratingly simplistic and unhelpful, occasionally alarmist and contradictory. The most irritating advice is from people quoting the leaflets in the Ovex packets. Here is my experience, which I hope adds information that is genuinely helpful and also new to the war against threadworms. I did all the right things - Ovex, cleaning, children trained not to scratch, scrub nails and wash bottoms in the morning. It would clear up in the children then come back and I treated them a few times over a couple of months. I would say that now they are free of infestation. BUT, despite spending the best part of £100 on Ovex (Ha! That's why the drug companies don't find a permanent solution!!), I personally just could not shift them. I was absolutely scrupulous in NEVER touching my bare bum, keeping up the cleaning regime, etc. The Ovex just DID NOT WORK. I still found worms in the days following treatment and there was no let up. I took Ovex daily for 5 days, with no effect. I also could not understand why I felt itchy and saw small worms on my anus during the day. I was showering 4 to 5 times a day and it was really distressing. My research told me that the female worms come out at night to lay eggs, only after they have reached maturity, at which point they are upwards of 1cm in size. I was seeing 3mm worms on my anus throughout the day. The itching was accompanied by a sticky sensation which I was desperate to wash away. [b:716aeed2f9]Then I realised what had been happening:[/b:716aeed2f9] When I shower in the morning I wash thoroughly. However this is not enough. The females lays her eggs in the folds of the anus. And she lays hundreds of thousands of them. When I wash with soap, I am not cleaning every fold in my anus. My childrens' bottoms are positively smooth and flat compared to mine which is ravaged by childbirth and the odd haemorrhoid. This would explain why I have been itching and seeing worms in the daytime. The eggs that have been laid at night are hatching during the daytime, then crawling back up into my intestine. This is retro-infection, claimed by some to be \""rare\"". This was always accompanied by the appearance of tiny skin flakes in my knickers. I made sure I wore black knickers so I could monitor this. Sure enough, the level of itching was directly related to the amount of small white flakes in my underwear. I can only assume this is debris left behind after the worms have hatched. [b:716aeed2f9]Solution:[/b:716aeed2f9] I changed from washing with soap, to using an emollient cream (diprobase for eczema), which I carefully work into all the nooks and crannies before rinsing, then repeat the process. While not convinced they have left yet (I've only been doing this for about 3 weeks), I no longer have to shower in the daytime and do not get the flaky debris in my pants. [b:716aeed2f9]Aggravating factors:[/b:716aeed2f9] I definitely noticed that a day or two after having a sugar binge (e.g. eating huge packet of sweets) I would have an explosion of worms, day and night. If you can manage it, giving up sweets and sugar is very likely to help you win the war. Whilst trying to break the cycle, it's also worth making a rule to always wear long pyjama bottoms over knickers to bed. This eliminates the need to wash bedlinen daily, as long as you are sure you are not scratching during the night. [b:716aeed2f9]What didn't work:[/b:716aeed2f9] Ovex Eating garlic cloves Pumpkin seeds (nice though and very good for you!) The doctor! Couldn't offer anything stronger than Ovex and just told me not to put my hands near my mouth. I have laid myself bare in this post, which is still uncomfortable even with anonymity, in the hope that my experience may help someone else who is suffering from this hideous parasite.

Threadworm,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/threadworm-questions-and-answers-301614,threadworm questions and answers,"Hi to all.    Here is my stori About 6 months ago my daughter caught up threadworm from school, this is a not the issue however as she was treated and cleared within a fortnight. I on the other hand took the medication mebendazole several times eventually taking it every day for a week, but to no relief. After doing a lot of reading I upped the cleaning tenfold and took a papayaseed smoothie recipe that I found.  This worked and for 2 weeks they were gone. But they came back in great numbers after that.they wouldn't bother so much but my children have been reinfected So I tried taking the smoothie again and it killed some off but not all.  So after a week I started taking de with a bulb of garlic every morning on an empty stomach.  I got a lot of die off symptoms but that was 3 weeks ago and they are still laying eggs.  They are in less numbers but still there.  I put the de all over my bum at night which means I get a better night sleep. I am currently eating a high fibre low sugar diet mostlyalkaline foods. I also take a papaya seed smoothie daily plus garlic and lots of de as well as cayenne pepper apple cider vinegar oregano vvitamins especially vitamin c.  The problem is they have moved.  I can feel them in my legs and arms. I put tea tree oil all over my neck and nose at night to stop them going further than that.

Hello, I am 25, weigh around 200lb and and 6ft in height... I can't remember the exact day this happened but it was around Sunday 27th.. possible Saturday it was on the last weekend anyway. woke up fine no issues, I had to go to my sisters as Her and my mother, was going out to collect something so I had to watch dogs and walk them...... My sister just gave birth few weeks ago and has 4 year old daughter too.. so the car she is using even though it's normal sized car.. with car seats on each side.. with only space being in the middle is very awkward to get in and out. anyway... got out the car.. never noticed any problems was a struggle to get out but I did anyway... walked the DOG like normal, got back, all seemed fine... then I sat on the floor as was looking at my sisters partners PS4 as something was wrong with the controller.. after I was done with that sat down watching TV.. eventually .. got up to get some water.. and noticed some MILD pain in my right testicle... thought nothing of it really, and then I had to go out into my sisters garage to try find some Halloween stuff... that's when I felt more pain.. thinking this isn't normal... .. I assumed i done something to it getting out the car.. maybe bruised it or something..... every time I stood up I felt pain drop right in the testicle .. few days have went by.. and noticed some testicle and scrotum swelling.. it was pretty big at one point.. also the testicle felt more firmer/harder.... my left one is completely normal..... My other symptoms didn't come right way. not badly at least till yesterday Night... I keep getting this radiating pain going down my right leg.. feels the same as my right testicle. though I did think the swelling did go down a little... and honestly worried like crazy.. googling.. testicle cancer.. etc... and now I doubt I can see a doctor till monday at the latest........ also noticed my semen was yellow???? this has never happened either up until possibly the injury... never noticed it that day but only a day or so after... about 3 times had yellow semen.. though last night I had my normal white semen. not checked again... the testicle in question does seem abit higher than it normally is? though I am not sure on that one.. any advice would be great, tried hot baths and ice packs etc."" UPDATE: thought i'd update.. maybe someone has a better idea, went to doctors yesterday he says it's swollen for sure, at first he was like infection he was thinking of, but told me he would of thought it would of been more painful, told him it Was at times.. but he took no notes.. of me saying that.. then told him how I thought I bruised it etc he told me he would of thought if it was bruised it would be something i'd noticed quick and not hours later, but again I wasn't really focusing on the area and had stuff to get done so who knows, he does say it's not always the case.. and you can get a vessel leaking sometimes, that can delay the pain, but that was basically it, never gave me much information what else It could've of been and booked me in from an ultra sound to check whats happening , so no clue what is going on. UPDATE 2: right now pain seems not as bad.. specially if I sit.... the testicle now feels soft.. and not hard as it was before.. though my scrotum is still like a balloon. and testicle  may still be swollen... my  normal testicle is fine.. the right one however the scrotum  still seems puffed up.. it's the best way I can put it. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Week 3 another wedge out full weight bearing but with crutches still no issues. Week 4 last wedge out and fully walking with no crutches,  21/7/17 I have had boot removed had one physio session and walking without boot and crutches,  slight discomfort and strange sensations in the foot but that's to be expected. I'm doing exercises at home and I'm really happy how things have gone, only my second day without any aids but I'm feeling very positive.

Tendon Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/ball-growing-after-surgery-to-fix-cut-tendon-and-nerve-673897,Ball growing after surgery to fix cut tendon and nerve,"Hello, I am a 21 years old French female, about 1m55-57 and around 50-55 kg. Last year while I was on holidays on the canary Island, I fell and cut my right hand on a piece of glass. After going to a very average hospital where they told me my nerve was cut and I would require surgery, I decided to go back to the south of France where I live and where I felt more comfortable getting my surgery. So by the time I got to the France, in a hand specialised hospital, they told me my tendon was also cut. When I got the surgery my tendon had fell in my wrist, which made the surgery a bit more complicated. I was planning on moving to the Netherlands that month so I still did, tough it meant I had to change the person who was doing my physiotherapy to a new one in Belgium. He felt like my thumb had already too many lissions and that I would have to force and suffer a lot if I did not want surgery. After 6 months of physiotherapy EVERYDAY (but on weekends) he really believed I should get surgery to cut the lissions of the tendon tough my surgeon was really against this idea. I stopped going to the physiotherapy around this time as it was really affecting me mentally and that I wanted to find a normal life again. From then my finger is doing much better, I use my hand like I used too even tough I still cannot fold my thumb, I saw two surgeon in France who told me that they were very pleased with the results. My sensibility is 100% accurate and I can do pretty much everything with my hand. The problem came around 6 months ago, there was this tiny ball starting to grow right where my tendon was cut and fixed. I started to massage the ball very hard like my Belgium physiotherapist told me to do, and I was crying of pain and the ball would just get bigger and bigger everyday. Now the ball is big and it is becoming more and more annoying on my daily life, every time i pick up something I have an electrical shock going in my fingers and wrist, and my finger get tired very quickly when I write and it hurts where the ball is. The two surgeon I saw think it comes from the surgical wire that did not disintegrate itself properly. After an exam it turn out to be the case but both my surgeons are not necessarily recommending to get rid of the ball as it could fragilise the tendon and make my finger worse. I was wondering how could the finger could get worse since it is not moving and I have only gained like 0.8% of mobility. But then maybe they mean it more like the tendon will be painful when I move it? or do they mean it might crack??? I am just so confused about this because I also cannot find anything on internet about the risks of doing this surgery. And also the ball is very annoying, and preventing me from working longer, or carrying stuff. So I feel like I am still young and don't really see myself living like that for another 50 years or more. But then if I could lose all of what I have worked for, for the past 12 months I am not sure if the risk is worthy... If anyone could tell me more about the risks, and has anyone got what I did and did the surgery? What would you recommend is the safest option? Thank you, and sorry if it is not well explained but all of my documents are in French and I have translated the best I could. There are picture of my hand after surgery, and the ball now as well as the exam results 0 likes, 0 replies "

I immediately knew what happened so was at the ER being seen by a doc within 45 min.  First ER doc I saw said it was ruptured but wouldn’t need surgery(this was before x-Ray & ultrasounds) Second ER doc I saw who was privileged to my test results told me, “100% surgery kid” we can get you into see one of our OS tomorrow. I asked why the discrepancy between the two and he said the other doctor was mistaken, and I def needed the surgery.  My mom is a nurse at another local hospital system(ranked higher than the one I went for ER if that matters) and friends with one daughters of the Orthos who worked out of there. Saw him the very next morning to get a third opinion. He confirmed the ATR and when reviewing my options he told me  “the only reason i would advise using surgery is if you were a professional athlete or trying to be one” “if you were my son, He’d be going the conservative, non-surgical route” “there’s only a 10% high change of rereputer compared to surgical using this method.” All these things made me feel great, I didn’t want to undergo the knife, no hard cast, no heavy pain meds and could go back to work in a coupe days...and only 10% re-rupture rate!? That was all I needed to hear.  He gave me a boot with minor wedge inserts, told me to take it easy for a week then use my judgement for WB and come back to see him in 3 weeks.  My job is pretty high paced, I averaged 18k steps a day before my injury so I was nerous about how being booted up and riding around a scooter would affect my productivity. My worries we’re valid, I had to take more breaks, work less hours when needed, and couldn’t make many of my out of office meetings. So I started falling behind, which my company has been great with accommodating my workload until this is over with.  I love to play sports. At 29 I regularly play softball, basketball, football, sand volleyball, mountain bike, snowboard and water sports. The strengths  of my game have always been my speed, acceleration and agility.  I’m worried that I’m never going to be close to those levels again even if I take PT very seriously.  So, after 4 weeks of das boot and being the scooter guy at work. I’ve reading countless articles on this injury,  and I feel like I might have made the wrong choice by using  non surgical repair method. I feel like my doc should have made surgery seem like a better option for someone with my lifestyle.  Does anyone agree? Or am I just being pessimistic?  0 likes, 9 replies "

I’m 32 years old, previously fairly active. I completely ruptured my Achilles Tendon in September 18 and placed into boot (non-surgical route) and during rehab process I removed a step out from my boot and during this felt my Achilles re-rupture. In December 18 I had an ultrasound to assess and my Achilles had 10-20% intact (not sure the technical word). Surgeon advised in January 19 for me to proceed with rehab and get out boot which I eventually did in February. Rehab is very tough and really struggling with my Achilles strengthening works and getting a lot of throbbing in the affected area and still not walking fluidly 6 weeks since coming out boot. My surgeon has advised he will only operate once it ruptures again. Just wondering if anyone had any similar experience? Am I likely to recover naturally?

I completely ruptured my Achilles nine months ago and received a surgical repair a month later. I had a cast, walker boot, crutches, etc. I underwent a course of physiotherapy and was discharged from it in January. However, I’m concerned that my progress is slow. My Achilles is still painful with every step and the area is swollen (photos  , apologies for ugly hairy leg). I limp when I walk and my range of motion is poor. I can just about get my knee over my toes, whereas the unaffected leg has a much greater range. The range of motion has not improved over the last few months. I can’t jog or jump but I can just about do one-leg heel raises, though it’s painful for 48 hours afterwards. Lately I’ve been doing fewer exercises as the pain and swelling have increased. I still wear a dressing on the scar as otherwise my shoes rub on it and it blisters. Is my progress normal for eight months post-op or do I have reason to be concerned? I worry that I’m going to be stuck with a limp, limited range of motion, pain and an inability to do sports for the rest of my life. I used to be very active and that would be very hard to live with.

Tendon Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/still-in-pain-after-achilles-surgery-590908,Still in pain after Achilles surgery,"I had Achilles reconstruction surgery back on December 20, 2016. I'm still in pain almost 5 months later.  I'll give a little history. I started having heel pain in January 2016. Doctor told me I had tendonitis. I started with physical therapy and it unfortunately did not help. I wore a boot for 6 weeks (actually ended up being 3 months cause the Dr. told me to keep wearing it) and that didn't help either. Dr. referred me to another Dr. who does tenex procedure. I had that on August 8. While I was in therapy I ended up tearing my tendon. The Dr. referred me to a surgeon and that's when I decided on the surgery.  I was feeling great after the surgery (other than the pain that came along with it) I had my foot in a bandaged cast for 2 weeks. On New Year's Day I ended up losing my footing on crutches after a shower ( I only used crutches for showers, I had a scooter) and ended up landing on my foot and falling. I called the nurse the following day and she asked questions and said it didn't sound like I did damage. I was sore for a few days and then it seemed ok. I got my stitches out and was put in a plaster cast for 4 weeks. Most of the issue was swelling and soreness. After my cast came off I was put in a boot and told to do PT right away. I didn't get an appointment for almost 2 weeks later. I did non weight bearing exercises for a couple of weeks. My foot was so swollen I couldn't fit in my sneaker. I also couldn't walk without the use of crutches. When I could finally fit my foot in my sneaker I started weight bearing exercises and started walking without crutches about 2 weeks later. I did 8 weeks of therapy and the pain just kept getting worse. I have pain in my heel and I have pain in the tendon. It feels as it did before I had the surgery. I went back to my part time job over a month ago and went back to my full time job 2 weeks ago. Both jobs I'm on my feet. By the end of the day my foot is so swollen and bruised and I get sharp pains in my heel and in the tendon. I've been working shorter shifts and it still doesn't help. I put inserts in my shoes for heel and arch support and it helped at first withi not as much pain but I'm back to the bad pain. I've been in tears it hurts so badly. The Dr said to come back in 3 months if I'm still in pain when I went to my 3 month appointment. I'm just curious if anyone else has similar pains and symptoms. I was told I would have swelling for up to a year but I wasn't told I'd have sharp pains. I'm hoping I didn't tear it again.  0 likes, 68 replies "

I've noticed few things for which I'm not quite sure whether I noticed them before and I need someone who can relate to this for reassurance before I jump to conclusions. First, orientation of my testicles is not the same. It appears that one testicle is differently oriented in the scrotum from another one by a certain angle. Is this normal? In the back side of one of my testicles (left one) not far from the bottom I can feel a tiny (about the width of a needle) straight line attached to my testicle which can be felt for like 1 and 1.5 cm until the point where it either disappears or is disattached from my testicle.  This line is really tiny in both width and bulge (I'd say less than 1 mm) and seems to have a regular shape. Since it's so narrow it's hard to say whether it's hard or soft. Does the lower end of epididymis  feel like this when touched by a finger or this is something to worry about? I had a hard time finding the similar pattern in other testicle (maybe because of different orientation?), but I managed to do so in a shower. This line on the other testicle feels the same way, although it's much harder to find and it doesn't appear to be so pronounced as it appears to be even smaller than the other one.  If this is really epididymis, is it normal for it to be slightly larger and easier to find on one testicle? Thank you very much for your replies 0 likes, 3 replies "

But now the dull ache has changed to an unbearable pain which is constant, this depends on what clothing I wear. Wearing Jeans, Trousers or Chinos makes the pain worse, and sitting, bending or walking also triggers the pain. I cant sit for long periods and I cant stand for long periods without being in excruciating pain, my quality of life has reduced to the point I dont/cant do anything. I have been to my GP many times about the problem, I've had several Ultrsound scans only to find some small  's and small Cysts, they said they were too small to cause any pain. I was sent to a Urologist back in 2013, they said they could remove part or all of the epididymis, but said the procedure may not solve the problem, they said it could make the pain worst. They recommended pain management and to use Amitriptyline, I found this didn't work, so I've been living with this pain ever since.   I've just recently seen another Urologist who seems more helpful, he has agreed to remove the epididymis as a last resort. He wants me to try Pelvic Floor exercises for 6 months, if this doesn't help he may try a nerve block injection. The problem is... I cant wait another 6 months, I've had this pain over 10 years and I'm becoming tied, its really wearing me down to the point of being depressed. I am in excruciating agony all day, everyday. The only time I am free from pain is when I am asleep, I always go to bed with the pain, but when I wake up in the morning the pain has gone (which is bliss). But as soon as I get dressed and go to sit down, or even bend or do any exercise, the pain starts within minutes, and will last the rest of the day. I was considering telling the urologist that I cannot wait another 6 months, that I need this operation to remove the epididymiss now, and hope it works. Has anyone here ever had their right epididymiss tube removed with success of revealing the pain in testicle, leg/ and foot? Thank you in advance for any advice giving.    0 likes, 4 replies "

Testicular Pain and Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/constant-pain-in-testicles-perenium-left-leg-689760,"Constant pain in testicles, perenium, left leg","Hello, I am in a position where I feel like I am never going to recover and I can't go on in the pain I'm in... I don't know who can help me or what I need to do next, the pain is ruining my life. I've had 6 GP appointments, 2 A&E trips and a GUM appointment now and I haven't had a solid diagnosis of what the issue is. I am currently waiting for the GUM results and I have an ultrasound booked on the 9th of Jan but that feels like it's years away for me and I don't think I can't wait until then. Summary of pain; Started off as as put-up-with pain in my perineum but gradually got worse and worse - current symptoms; Summary of what isn't an issue; Summary of everything so far; Feb/March 2017 I'll mention this here as it's referred to later - I contracted epididymo-orchitis via sleeping with someone who had Chlamydia, however I was tested for all STD/STIs at the time and they all came back negative and I've been sexually inactive since then. Diagnosis & Treatments etc. so far; 1 - 30/10/2018 (GP #1) Checks; Vitals Urine Blood Examination of perineum area Diagnosis; Possible groin strain Treatment; High strength cocodamol (500mg/30mg) 2 - 20/11/2018 (GP #2) Checks; Examination of perineum, testicles, prostate Diagnosis; Possibly infection from 2017 not cleared up properly Treatment; 14 days of Ciprofloxacin every 12 hours 3 - 18/12/2018 (GP #3) Checks; Examination of perineum, testicles, groin Vitals Urine test Diagnosis; Unknown Treatment; More 500/30 cocodamol Referred for ultrasound Ultrasound ended up being booked for 26th of Jan 4 - 19/12/2018 (GAP #4) This is when right groin pain started. Due to feeling of hopelessness (6 week waiting time...), having already endured the pain for a while and this new pain I ended up having a breakdown at work and was sent home. Checks; Vitals Groin area Diagnosis; Unable to do anything until ultrasound Treatment; Told me to go A&E, gave me a letter 5 - 19/12/2018 (A&E #1) Checks; Examination of groin/testicles Blood Urine Vitals Diagnosis; Epididymitis Treatment; 7 days of Ciprofloxacin 14 days of Doxycycline Contacted GP telling them to change ultrasound from ""routine"" to ""urgent"" 6 - 20/12/2018 (GP #5) Went back because I didn't get any pain medication from A&E Checks; Vitals Diagnosis; N/A Treatment; Naproxen 500mg every 12 hours Changed ultrasound to urgent, advised not to get my hopes up Ultrasound moved from 26th Jan to 9th Jan Told me to come back if pain doesn't improve 7 - 24/12/2018 (GP #6) Pain didn't improve, been 3 full days Checks; Vitals Urine Diagnosis; Nothing he can do, need ultrasound Treatment; Gave me letter for A&E 8 - 25/12/2018 (A&E #2) Waited a day to see if it would improve, it didn't so went A&E Checks; Blood Urine Vitals Thorough examination of area by 2 doctors (normal and senior) Diagnosis; Doctor, senior doctor and consultant came to conclusion it could be chronic Chlamydia (from 2017...?) and that it's possible to get false negatives on those tests Treatment; Single dose of 1000mg Azithromycin albeit I had to collect it from a pharmacy the next day Senior doctor will contact GP again advising they need to push to get a quicker ultrasound Consultant said he contact GP to ask why I keep being sent to A&E there isn't much they can do and it's a waste of my time and also NHS time ############ 26/12/2018 - took Azithromycin and condition seemed to improve, pain was less severe albeit is this just a placebo effect or me hoping it would work? ############ 9 - 27/12/2018 (GUM #1) Checks; Full STD/STI check (blood/urine) - waiting for results Through examination of groin/perineum area; she has been the only person to actually locate exactly where the pain is via touch, even I haven't been able to. Prostate examination Diagnosis; Highly doubtful it's chronic Chlamydia as I tested negative for it before and it's pretty accurate. Nerves run down legs from back, could be pressure there as it's possible to have problems with no back pain albeit an MRI would be needed to check this. Treatment; No further medication due to already being on Ciprofloxacin, Doxycycline and Azithromycin. Await results from tests. Suggests I may need to see a urologist or a something-else (forget what she said now) ################# Current situation ################# I would say the worst pain I've been in was when I had epididymo-orchitis - I think a close second was crashing into a tree at about 30mph when I was younger which caused me to be unable to walk for 2 weeks. Once I started taking antibiotics for the epididymo-orchitis the pain went from a 10/10 to a 4/10 in a matter of a few days. In my current situation it started as a 2/10 progressed to about 8/10 on xmas day. It dropped to about a 6/10 after the Azithromycin and has remained there until tonight when it's gone up to about a 6.5 - I went to the pub to watch some friends perform and I had to stand/sit in uncomfortable chairs for a few hours and it made it worse until I just had to leave. #################### Sorry for the essay, I tried to keep it concise - if anyone does take the time to read it and has any insight or advice I would be forever grateful. 0 likes, 17 replies "

The only time I get relief is when I lay down, but as soon as I stand up the pain starts again. I've had 5 ultrasound scans which have revealed some small cysts and varicolceles below 2mm in size, the Urologists say these are not big enough to be causing the pain, so they don't want to operate??? I was offered a nerve block injection last November, but I stupidly cancelled the appointment. The pain specialist explained that the nerve block may not even work, or may only bring some relief for a short time, a few days or a few weeks, so I thought what was the point???? I'm now due to go back to Urology next week  to see what they want to do, my fear is... what if they do offer a surgical approach, but what if the surgery doesn't work, or make things worst???

Threadworm,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/advice-needed-bad-infestation--19083,Advice needed....bad infestation!,"Hi. So glad I found this site! I responed to another thread (how much do I not want to hear that word!) but thought I'd start a fresh one to describe my situation (hell!) and seek advice I teach so I tend to blame the kids for the infections. I've had threadworms twice in 4 years despite being very hygenic at school. Each time they took some shifting. My latest infestation is terrible. It started 9 weeks ago (saw worm in anus) and then realised I have been showing other symptoms but hadn't put 2 and 2 together. I took an Ovex tablet but because you then have to do a massive clean I then took some Ovex liquid formula a week later incase I inhaled eggs in dust. I took the second Ovex at the right time. Things improved.  Into the 3rd week I took another tablet (a right pill popper I am!) just to be safe. Could I have made myself immune to the tablets? I didn't change my diet and continued to drink quite a bit of alcohol on nights out. Lo and behold they came back with a vengeance. I had them in my vagina and intestines (very itchy bottom). I freaked and took  Ovex. 4 days later it hadn't improved so I saw my Doctor and like a fool, broke down in tears at age 30! She couldn't work out why Ovex wasn't doing the job so she assumed it was down to my hygene on some level. I said that it was always possible that I was inhaling the eggs when dusting/hoovering etc. What a farce. She gave me Pripsen (powder sachet). This certainly calmed them and I started to pass them (dead) BUT all the while my vagina was very sore and the discharge (sorry for the detail but it may help others!!) was 'stringy, white and worm like'. Yes I freaked. Unsure as to whether they were dead. I assumed that Pripsen was getting rid...doing it's job.  I made massive change to diet - no wine/beer, chocolate, cheese, bread. Cut down on carbs. Stopped all processed food. Bought stuff from Holland and Barrett herbal shop. All went well until... the mucus in my nose appeared white and stringy. The flaming things had entered my nasal passages. I don't know how. I'd read on the internet that it was possible (they NEVER say this on the treatment information leaflet!). I freaked. My nose was itchy. I tried nasal spray...this was hurting my nose as there wasn't actually anything wrong per se.  I continued with the cleaning and swabbing of all bodily areas. I took another Ovex a day earlier than recommended (I could tell they were alive in my gut) and sure enough started passing dead worms in stools. Freaked again. Seriously - at this point I thought I was going insane. Couldn't sleep. Felt weak. Spending an absolute fortune on cleaning products. Started to actually throw away clothes, knickers and duvets (see, insane!!) Okay, let me end this essay...sorry.  Basically, I have one Pripsen sachet left to take on Friday but  I still have stringy mucus in nose. Vagina is showing 'worm' symptoms again ...and...they are coming out of my eye discharge (not kidding!). I have no idea if they are alive as they are soo small and stringy (like the nose). Worse when I wake up in the morning. I was getting more crusty sleep in the eyes...then I had a proper look...and got a hell of a shock. Nearly vomited even though they were tiny and dead. I am in hell. I do not know how to kill them in these areas. The internet says it's possible for them to reach these regions but offers no solutions. I'm eating soo much fruit but I read that this could encourage. I just don't know what to do for the best. I am exhausted - I can't sleep, have rings under eyes, my hands are soo sore and fingers look like I've been in the bath for a month. I won't have friends over and they have noticed 'I'm ill'. School starts tomorrow and I am dreading it. Sorry for the ramblings but I wanted to be honest and give a complete picture! DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY ADVICE?  Anyone ever had the discharge in the eyes, nose, vagina (sorry guys) I am at my wits end and soo run down with all this. Thanks for your time. 4 likes, 202 replies "

Threadworm,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/finally-beat-threadworm-here-s-how-i-did-it--35363,"Finally beat Threadworm, here's how I did it.","Firstly I want to say that I am not a medical doctor and so medical advice should be taken before taking any medication listed below. I started having the itchy bottom symptoms around September 2011 and booked in an appointment with my doctor.  The doctor said it was nothing serious and told me to take Anusol cream for the itch.  There is no doubt that the Anusol cream did relieve the itching symptoms for a few hours but I was constantly waking up throughout the night with a horrible urge to itch. It got so bad that I was getting constant baths every few hours just to provide some sort of relief.  I was very tired and irritable the next day in work and started feeling depressed and even started losing weight as my appetite had gone. At the time I was single (30 year old man) with no kids and so thought threadworm would be unlikely the cause and perhaps it was piles.  The itching just seemed to get worse and worse even during the day so I started researching the internet for hours and hours and decided it must be threadworms.  I also confirmed the presence of threadworm by excreting into a large piece of tinfoil around the toilet seat and the small white thread like worms were visible although not in great numbers. I took the Ovex (mebendazole) tablet and after 2 or 3 days the itching decreased and finally stopped.  I was so thankful that this ordeal was over, then to my horror the symptoms started to appear again after about a week.  I immediately took another Ovex and followed a very strict hygiene routine of changing my sheets every day and washing the bath / shower etc with bleach.  All carpets were vacuumed and door handles wiped down. Again I was given several days where the itching stopped but it wasn’t long before the dreading wriggling sensation returned as soon as I got into bed at nights and I was back to square one.  I remember feeling so down, I had to cancel a date and just sat in the house depressed and looking up websites about threadworm for hours and hours.  It finally got to the point where I was so depressed that I wondered if life was worth living any more.  I read many posts online about people who have had this condition for 20+ years which didn’t help my situation. I remember one night while sitting in the bath at about 2am having being woken up by the itch, I said to myself I am going to beat this problem once and for all.  I decided to research herbal remedies and read pages of useful information on how to beat the worms once and for all.  I must say that a lot of the useful tips came from this website which is why I have decided to post my experience here in the hope it helps others out. Materials Needed The first thing to do is order the following 3 products from Organic nutrition: 50ml Black Walnut Hull Extract (extra strength tincture) 120 Clove Capsules 120 Wormwood Capsules         Full instructions Total cost = £36.75 1 x Dust Mask which can be bought in a DIY store 1 x Nail Brush 1 x packet of Ovex 1 x Packet of pumpkin seeds from a health store 1 x packet of odourless garlic capsules 4 x packets of chopped up pineapple chunks Once all the materials and capsules have arrived, you need to do the follow: Take 1 ovex tablet with water and while wearing the dusk mask you need to vacuum every inch of carpet especially in your bedroom.  (The eggs can easily spread during this method so to prevent you from getting re-infected it is advised to wear a dust mask which covers your mouth and nose).  After vacuuming, you need to change your bed sheets and wipe down all door handles, tap handles etc.  Place the bed sheets and any towels in the wash at 90 degrees and iron once dry.  This is the only way to be sure the eggs are killed. The process must be repeated everyday for at least 10 days, I know it is a pain but believe me the end result is worth the hassle. You should also start taking your Black Walnut, clove and wormwood capsules as per the instructions that come with them.  Also try and eat a few handfuls of the pumpkin seeds throughout the day and take a portion of pineapple chunks daily.  These are all well know anti-parasitic remedies that actually work.  Follow this routine for 2 weeks. Finally and very importantly, the eggs that may still be in your house can survive up to 2 weeks in normal conditions.  If these are re-inhaled again then you are back to square one.  I read in many forums that if the house is warmed up to 50 degrees then the eggs can only survive for 2 hours. Every morning when I went to work, I left the heat on full blast for 9 hours at the highest temperature and opened the curtains in every room as the eggs are also sensitive to sunlight.  Vacuumed every night with my dust mask on and tried not to eat fast foods but stuck to things like brown rice and vegetables. I am happy to say that so far 2 months have past and the wriggling feeling has not returned and my life has got back to normal and I am now in a relationship again.  I never found out how I originally got infected with threadworm but hopefully I have got rid of these horrible parasites once and for all. I hope this helps some of you to rid these parasites and should you have any questions then please feel free to ask. 7 likes, 136 replies "

Threadworm,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/dispel-urban-myths-you-are-not-reinfecting-yourselves--29232,Dispel urban myths - You are not reinfecting yourselves!,"100mg of Mebendazole is RARELY strong enough to get rid of the worms throughout the entire body in a single dose - despite what it says on the box!  You can get a stronger drug from your doctor (prescription only) called Albendazole - it's actually one of the ingredients in many animal worming tablets and Mebendazole is derived from it (so it works in a similar way - starving the little critters of glucose) - and the sad thing is your doctor probably hasn't even heard of it! - he keeps giving out the same old 100mg of Mebendazole (in the form of Ovex for example) which is simply just not   strong enough to kill all the live worms in a single dose.  I have been reading lots of academic journals on threadworms to try and get through to the truth about them and get past all the urban myths! and I can tell you now THERE ARE NO KNOWN INCIDENTS OF THREADWORMS BECOMING RESISTANT TO MEBENDAZOLE! It's just that in laboratory testing 100mg Mebendazole works... and in practical trials it SEEMED to work because the worms went.  Maybe over time with good hygiene the numbers of worms can be whittled down and eradicated... but the problem is they often migrate... Let me tell you my own experience... A couple of months ago I had a very bad infestation ...I had them up my nose, in my ears (I found them dead on the end of cotton buds), lungs (I coughed a live one up whilst running), and even experienced a very painful one in my eye at night (which laid eggs which I had to remove the next morning) - places really that I never knew they could go. I took Mebendazole instantly, and then again 14 days later, I blitzed my home as advised, washed bed sheets, damp dusted and cleaned everything on the first day of medication. All my symptoms went. Just over a week ago however, I felt I had them back again... slight itching around the anus and a wriggling sensation on and off at night. I bought a family pack of Ovex (4 x tablets of 100mg Mebendazole) I took one tablet, but on the 3rd night I was still getting wriggling sensations and the sticky substance around that area in the morning, eventually on the 4th night I got no more symptoms. On the 7th day I got a wriggling sensation right at the top of my nose, and my tummy didn't feel good either so I took another dose of Mebendazole, later that afternoon I sneezed out an adult dead female worm! (recognizable  as longer than the males). Mebendazole is supposed to act all over the body yet this was an adult worm - if the Mebendazole had worked properly 7 days ago surely this would have come out long ago. Threadworms are very delicate and decompose very quickly, this worm had not decomposed and was very much still in tact; implying it had died recently - most likely within hours. This confirmed to me that the single dose of Mebendazole I'd had 7 nights before just hadn't been strong enough to kill this one. I then read somewhere on this forum that one guy suggested taking 2x Mebendazole tablets every day for 3 days - and even suggested taking dog worming tablets as they were alot stronger. I now go along with this advice! I'm on my second day of taking 2x daily Mebendazole tablets (so have just taken my 4th ) and I have found I am getting streams of dead worms coming out; some I'm 'hocking up' from the lungs (Just FYI worms in the lungs is a very common but often unnoticed symptom after egg inhalation - the worms after hatching, climb to the top of the lungs and enter the throat to restart the cycle), others are coming out from my nose with mucus and yet since that 3rd day I've had no symptoms of worms 'down below'. In fact without taking the medication and seeing these dead worms, I'd have no idea I had them at all! Many of the websites say that people can have them without symptoms - How many people must have them who don't know they have them I dread to think!   I read an article published in a journal called GUT by a G.C.Cook, it was published in 1994 so might be considered old now... but it still contains some invaluable information.   This should interest and hopefully calm the people frantically going round cleaning everywhere thinking they are reinfecting themselves...           He says that the eggs prefer a moist and cool (body temperature) environment; if the environment is warm and dry, most of the eggs will become infertile in 1-2 days: \""In warm dry conditions infectivity declines after 1-2 days\"" (p1159). He also states \""Household detergents exert little impact on the viability of eggs; cleaning a bathroom using a damp cloth moistened with an anti-bacterial agent or bleach merely spreads viable eggs. Simple laundering of clothes and linen disinfects them; shaking disseminates infective eggs\"" (p1161) - So using cleaning fluids won't penetrate the eggs but will just move them around but the good news is that just the movement of the washing machine will deactivate the eggs in your laundry.    If vibrations alone can 'disseminate infective eggs' then that dispels the idea that fruit could have infective eggs on it (as suggested might be the case somewhere on this forum) ..to be quite honest the idea that we could catch worms from any other human exchange is a very scary thought! - we would have to wash our post, our cash, credit cards, and tins and packets on the shelves at your local supermarket constantly... and it's just not true we can catch worms easily that way.   In my opinion you should just do a thorough clean on the first day of medication (or as soon as you realize you have an infestation) and then let things settle - don't clean anything more until after two weeks. Leave the eggs to become infertile over time (the max amount of which is 2 weeks as we keep being told by the websites - but according to this article - 2 days is more probable).   So long as you are following the advice of wearing the tight underwear at night, washing 'down there' in the morning and washing your hands and and nails (especially if you're scratching) thoroughly afterwards and before meals, then there is an extremely low chance of reinfection. The only danger left then is 'autoinfection' within the body. The advice on most packets of Mebendazole state to take first a tablet, then another, 14 days later... but I'm not convinced... Cook states that if the environment is right, the eggs will hatch and become worms within 6 hours. This is particularly pertinent for those eggs within the body as they will be in the most ideal environment. I also read on the NHS site:     that \""After two weeks, the worms reach adult size and begin to reproduce, starting the cycle again.\"" - so remind me again? ....why are we waiting 14 days before taking the next tablet??        If reinfection is as unlikely as it seems, then the horrible reality is that the medicine G.Ps are giving out are realistically not effective enough to get rid of all the worms in a single dose. The answer is to either take a stronger medicine (like Albendazole) with the doctor's consent, or take matters into your own hands with more frequent-than-recommended doses of Mebendazole (or take Animal worming tablets - not investigated this yet! ...but might make myself a human guinea pig soon!) Think about it - if Mebendazole is ok for children of the age of 2, it makes sense that adults with much stronger digestive constitutions (and bigger and longer large intestines) should need something stronger. It would seem to me that recurring incidents of worms are to do with autoinfection within the body rather than reinfection from outside the body. The Mebendazole in its present recommended dosage is just not strong enough to do the job. Mebendazole may be safe - but in my opinion it's too safe for the worms aswell... 3 likes, 31 replies "

Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/im-a-22-year-old-male-6-1-205-pounds-this-is-my-wpw-story--649851,"Im a 22 year old male. 6'1"" 205 pounds. This is my WPW story.","Hi, I'm really curious about something here but,  first let me give you some of my background. Also, this basically just turned into my Wolff-Parkinsons-White Syndrome (or WPW for short) story. All the way from the start, up until now. I knew it was bad when I woke up feeling like I was going to die everyday. It wasnt always like that though. In highschool, I first started having symptoms. All of a sudden, in my sophomore year gym class when we were playing basket ball on a hot dehydrating day. My heart started speeding at what I would guess was about 145bpm or more. I have a pretty good judge of where my heartrate is at nowdays. Almost to a tee without checking. Anyways, it freaked me out but I didnt experience any symptoms after that and I forgot about it. A few months later I broke a bone, when I went to the hospital they said that I will need a surgery, and that I will need to be put under anesthesia. So, in that case test were done to make sure it was safe. I went to cardiology. They noticed something was wrong. I got a ultra sound. The lady confirmed it was WPW. I was put under and had the surgery for my broken bone then, sent home with Vicodin. I went on to live with WPW for almost five years after that. For the first three or so years symptoms would come and go. From time to time they would be a little bit worse then others but not bad. But, in the last two years, the episodes would come more often and heavier. Until every single morning I would wake up super dehydrated and feeling like I was literally going to die. Thats when i knew i had to go in for the ablation. At this time, my Mom happened to have gotten a promotion at the hospital she worked at. Surprisingly, her promotion was to  Lead Nurse in the Cardiologist Department. Apparently, the doctor in her department is very talented at WPW ablations. So, my Mom schedules me in and a week later she drives me to his main office about 30 miles away. I go in super anxious and shaking. They shot me up with something good. The nurses played the best song for me off their Jambox, Peter Tosh - Reggae Mylitis. I was still shaking so they shot me up with something better. Then it subsided they made sure all those patches they put on were proper and that my body was in a comfortable position then I passed out. When I finally come around I immediately notice a difference. The nurse makes sure I don't sit up at all. Then, I recover somewhat and still messed up my blessed mom takes me around town and she buys me food. Then, I go home try to sleep the pain of basically just the incision sights and some heart pain (They said that a little pain was normal). I recover after 11 or so days and I'm back at work. Hard work. Commercial fishing, long hours and strenuous activity. I didnt feel as dehydrated anymore. Also, had absolutely no symptoms of Wolff Parkinson's White Syndrome. Anyways a year later which is about now. I have had some   lately and also I may have experienced some episodes of the elevated heart rate I've associated with WPW. I'm going to make an appointment as soon as i can and see how things go. This is my story so far. Still feel like I may die young but, I'll try to look past everything bad that's happened to me and move on. Live my life with vigor. And strife. SO, originally I said I'm curious about something. Im curious if anybody else that has been diagnosed with Wolff Parkinsons White Syndrome, has a lot of anxiety? Particularly curious if anybody has noticed less anxiety after their ablation?

Before going that route again, I wanted to try using Trichloroacetic Acid, which a lot of people said have worked for them. I'll give you guys a step-by-step of what I did to maybe see why nothing has happened. I bought a 4 ml vial of 100% TCA, which I diluted to 80% with .8 ml of distilled water. I washed my hands with natural, plain soap (plant based + no added dyes, fragrances), and then prepped the wart with an alcohol pad and spread petroleum jelly around the outside of the wart with a q-tip to protect the skin. I used another q-tip to dip into the TCA and then pressed it onto the wart gently. I noticed I didn't feel anything, so I proceeded to do it again. I ended up putting on TCA to the point where there was a visible layer of liquid resting on top of the wart, but I still didn't feel anything, and the wart didn't turn white! Do you think I accidentally got some petroleum jelly on the wart, preventing the TCA from getting through? The wart is a little thick, so I tried it on a smaller, thinner wart I have, but still did not feel or see anything happening. I am at a loss. Any help is appreciated. Thank you very much. 0 likes, 2 replies "

Grateful for comments from people who have been through similar thoughts.   Thank you! 0 likes, 2 replies "

I was given Lamisil at first as the doctor thought it could be  , which it was not.  The whole coming to terms with it has been both depressing and stressful so I'm putting it down to maybe just being due to stress.  There has never been any early hairloss in the family and I don't think it's genetic as it ties in exactly with the time the vitiligo started to get worse.  I've been told by the dermatologist that there is no connection between vitiligo and hairloss but I've heard of some one els who also had the same. I have started using Protopic cream in the hope that it may stop the vitiligo spreading. I'm grateful for any advice you may have. All the best 0 likes, 27 replies "

Vitiligo,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/vitiligo-my-experience-72985,Vitiligo- my experience,"I'm a 16 year old boy with vitiligo. I've had vitiligo since I was 11. It's been a difficult 5 years but my friends and family have pulled me through.  I know vitiligo isn't a life threatening disease, it doesn't affect my health but in this day and age- where society puts a lot of importance on looks, vitiligo is almost as bad.  Most of the pigments on my face have already dissipated and there are symmetrical patches across my body. Early on, what I found most difficult  was the little things like the looks that I got from people that passed by or the fact that people were so obviously avoiding the seat next to me on public transport probably thinking it's contagious or something. I don't blame them though, maybe i'd do the same if I was in their position. It wasn't long before I kind of stopped thinking about what others thought of me and focused on what I thought of myself. Still, this made my self-esteem very low and made me really insecure. It was only recently that it started getting difficult again, I was getting older and was thinking about what the future had in store for me. Questions that I really never thought of started popping up.  The biggest one being: who'd want to marry me? Of all the people in the world, why would anyone choose me? When people look at me all they'd see is someone who's different, an abnormal person.  I'm not really sure what i'm trying to achieve by posting this, it's not a question, but perhaps there's someone I can talk to who can relate or has been through this.  I'll  admit, It wasn't all bad, vitiligo, I feel has made me a better person. It definitely made me humble and appreciate things I otherwise might've taken for granted. Vitiligo has kind of opened my eyes- teaching me not to judge a book by its cover. 8 likes, 37 replies "

I contacted 3 Drs and all had different opinions. 2 of them were specialists I had email consultations with via an app. The first (an infectious disease consultant) said it was just a simple mole, then the second (a dermatologist) said pretty much the same thing.. that it looked like a freckle or a mole. The pictures I sent them were the ones attached below. I went for what I thought would be a confirmation at an STI clinic where the GP told me it looked like a genital wart. This concerned me a lot as I don't think it looks like a typical genital wart and so after a bit of research online (dangerous I know) I stumbled across something called Bowenoid Papulosis which I'd say it is closer to in appearance than normal HPV warts. But is a far worse thing to have as can be precancerous. I'm freaking out a little and any feedback would be much appreciated. I'm hoping just a mole. Praying its not BP!

Weight Loss - Intentional,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/getting-off-topamax-due-to-hair-loss-angry-and-need-advice-594393,Getting Off Topamax Due to Hair Loss - Angry and Need Advice,"In April, I finally saw a Dr about my weight. I had been watching what I eat, exercising and drinking half my weight in water every single day and still not losing any weight. At the time, I weighed 237 lbs. I should have been losing weight with diet and exercise, so I figured maybe I should get some tests done to make sure my health was okay.  My blood tests came back great! I'm in good health as far as my blood work shows, but I obviously need to lose weight. So, my Dr suggested a weightloss pill with the speed of lightning. I, being all about a helping hand, said ""OF COURSE!"" However, I did ask her these questions: ""Will it cause anxiety?""  I asked this, because I was put on Adderal as a young girl and it made me anxious to the point of attacks. It was awful. I always ask this of medication now because I don't ever want to go through that again. In response, she said ""Well, not Topamax. It's actually used as a mood stabilizer, so it'll be good for your anxiety.""  Amazing! Losing weight, helps with anxiety... What more could I ask for. Then I asked: ""What should I avoid? What should I expect? She said I didn't have to avoid anything. She said I didn't need to expect anything, just weightloss.  Well, great! SIGN ME UP SISTER!! God, I wish I had never, ever everrrr accepted this drug. The next few weeks weren't hell, but they were just confusing. I didn't have anxiety because I was cloaked with confusion. The brain fog was real, the tingling in my hands and feet was real, but that stuff didn't really bother me because I was slowly losing weight. Just slowly, though. Nothing drastic. I could handle those side effects. The pill actually helped me sleep. I didn't mind it, until... I started losing my hair. The one thing I loved about myself, the one thing that, vainly, kept me going, clearly started to thin drastically. It started with my eyebrows. Then I could see my scalp more and more. Now it's to the point where I don't want to brush it because it just falls out on its own, why brush it out even more? So, I'm stalled at 224 lbs, my once beautiful long hair looks like it is hanging on by a thread and I am self weaning myself off of this awful medicine.  The withdrawals have been intense. Anxiety, depression, stomach aches, even more confussion... I only took this medicine for a month!!! Like, how!? I have weaned properly with the advice of my Dr. I have an appointment on Monday, but I want to tell her how angry I am. She laughed at me when I told her about the hair loss and basically made it seem like I wasn't giving the pill a chance. She also said hair loss isn't a side effect of Topamax, but I have read differently.  I want to trust MY DOCTOR, but she has been so rude (so has her staff) and I'm just lost at this point. Who do I go to? Another Dr? Do I go to a weightloss clinic? What about my hair? Will it grow back? Is it permanent? I honestly have never been more depressed in my entire life. 0 likes, 7 replies "

In that time I have lost almost 2 stone. Naturally, some of that will be tissue, but a majority of it is thanks to eating very very small portions of food. You will be able to find the company in question by searching for Le Harve bariatric surgery. Their website is surprisingly old looking, but contains the information you need, including current prices.  I am a man in my early 40s attracted to this service because they do not require a high BMI for surgery. My BMI was between 32 and 33, and they accepted me after discussions with the consultant. I paid something in the region of £6,000 for the operation which included hotel stays and hospital treatment during the period. A British private hospital would not except me with a BMI of under 35, and their fee would be something in the region of £11,000. Overall, my experience was positive even through there were some moments I'd not rather re-live! I arrived at Paris airport and was taken by taxi to my hotel in le Harve. After two days of minor tests, I had the operation on the Wednesday, and arrived back at my hotel on the Friday for an overnight stay. On the Saturday morning the consultant visited me in my hotel room, undertook some checks, and explained various medicines, and I was taken by taxi back to the airport in Paris. It is only 2 1/2 weeks since I've had the operation, but I think I am pleased that I've undertook it; only time will tell!  I am happy to receive any personal messages through this site if you would like further details of my experience with the consultant, or any of the other staff from this firm. If you are in a similar position to me with a low BMI, I am pretty sure you would not regret bariatric surgery.   2 likes, 35 replies "

I’m 29 years old borderline obese and my last blood test came back normal for blood sugar I believe it was 5 (something) whereas before it was 5.6 which doesn’t make sense to me as I didn’t make any improvement. Also my total cholesterol and triglycerides were both slightly elevated both times. I’m really worried about developing diabetes or having heart attack one day. My diet is quite poor I think. I eat quite averagely a lot. I have a fair amount of carbs on most days like bread pasta or rice. 2 days of the weeks I find myself ordering a pizza takeaway I’ve tried so many times to stop them but now I’m starting to think it’s just an addiction. It used to be once a week but after stopping them and going Keto for a while I fell off the bandwagon and started ordering more. As I say my blood sugar was normal last time. Is this really bad what I’m doing? I eat maybe 2-3 portions of veg a day on average. But probably 25% of my calories is coming from pizza atm. I feel so guilty every time I order. Does blood sugar get worse with age? If not then how does prediabetes turn into diabetes? If my bloods are normal but I’m overweight do I have anything to worry about?

In the hospital, I was put on the following medications: clonozapem, risperidone, and lithium bicarbonate. These meds made me constantly hungry and I basically ate anything in sight. These meds also slowed down my metabolism so I had a lot less bowel movements than usual (rarely any). I left the hospital at 150 pounds with 15-20% body fat. Before the hospital, I had a perfect six pack and lots of muscle definition, but now, I don’t have any of that. I’m skinny fat now and I have a big bloated belly. Forget my appearance. The main issue that I’m having is that I lost all of my strength, mobility, and flexibility. I can barely walk 10 feet without getting tired. I feel like I have 20 pound dumbbells attached to my ankles. I can’t run long distances anymore. I can barely lift any weights. It feels so restricting and challenging. I can’t do pull-ups anymore. I can barely do push-ups, but when I do, my arms shake uncontrollably. My feet, legs, and joints feel so different when I walk. I feel as if I weigh 200 lbs. It feels like my ankles are tight and don’t have as much rotation as they used to. My tendons feel stuck and weak.  My hip flexors are so tight and don’t feel as free and flexible as they used to be. They feel so restricted. I can barely stretch like I used to. My body doesn’t like stretching now. It’s very uncomfortable. In general, I have so much muscular weakness, tightness, and stiffness. I tried working out and pushing my body for a consistent 2 week period to see if my body would wake up, but nothing changed. I woke up worse and worse every day. By “worse,” I mean that my legs ache every morning and it’s so hard to get out of bed. They ache so much and make me feel like the fat around my legs is suffocating my muscles. They ache in the daytime too. I am losing hope because I used to be such a strong, flexible, and agile athlete and now that is all gone to waste. Will I ever have my comfortable body back? Could a rapid gain of 20 lbs of fat in 2 weeks really have this type of effect on my body? Or could it be the medications that I am still taking (finished clonozapem, just finished taking risperidone, but still taking lithium 1200 mg)? What is wrong with me? What could help me get my old light, flexible, and strong body back? Please help.  0 likes, 0 replies "
Weight Loss and Gain - Unintentional,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/any-ideas-about-not-being-able-to-lose-weight-658523,Any ideas about not being able to lose weight,"Hi, I was wondering if anyone could help me. There's something wrong with me where if I try to lose weight and intentionally drop calories I tend to GAIN weight. Sometimes rapidly. I am very scared to try and diet because it seems I will try to diet do REALLY good never cheat and I tend to stay the same or gain. Then when I get discouraged for doing so well and gaining (I only mean a few lbs) I say forget it and i'll eat normal (which to be normal is STILL very healthy compared to most and watch what I eat) I will GAIN MORE because it's as if I reset my metabolism and slowed it down. it's VERY scary and discouraging. Also how can you explain this. Whenever I go on a cruise which has all you can eat buffet, I say SCREW this, I am going to eat whatever I want, i'm on vacation. So I will eat anything and as much as I want (not  binge eating but eating till im stuffed and desserts every day and I will a lot of the time LOSE WEIGHT, sometimes it's only about 2 lbs BUT once I lost a whole 4 lbs. Another example. When I went  to Europe recently I aid I am in Europe im going to eat whatever I want i'm in another coutry. I ate all bad foods...fattening...desserts from all diff countries sometimes desserts even in the morning like custard things or a croissant wtf all stuff I wouldn't dare eat at home. And I came home for the first time in my life losing 12 LBS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't understand what is going on with my body. I know diabetes runs in my family, everyones obese on my moms side. I want to lose weight but the diets don't work and when I work out or join a gym even working out INTENSELY along with diet with a personal trainer that was very expensive, I gained RAPIDLY they said it was muscle but I did it to LOSE weight. I am 200 lbs! This week, since I feel completely exhausted all the time everyday I thought maybe I might have a problem with gluten since my dna showed I had a gene for celiacs. SO I said maybe i'll try gluten free this week. I don't mean buying a bunch of high sugar gluten free items I just mean cutting out pasta bread etc...So I cut out pasta bread and all gluten...….I ended up getting low blood sugar one day so bad ( I sometimes get low blood sugar but not high blood sugar. ANYWAY....I strictly did NO pasta, NO bread (which I often can overeat on like instead of one serving i'll have 2 or eat till full) ANYWAY so I did really good this week I think. And I really thought MAYBE I might lose some weight because I havn't been having many carbs. What happened? my weight SKY ROCKETED!!!!!! I gained about 5 lbs in 4 days.....I could CRY I just don't know what to do anymore. PLease give me any ideas, I do know that on my dna test it did say I had a lot of obesity and diabetes genes is this why? EVERYONE I know who diets seems to lose weight and lose fast. Even my mom who is about 320lbs 5 feet tall, if she diets she will rapidly lose. it's KILLING me I need to lose! please don't reply if you say I didn't work out hard enough or if I cheat, because during times of dieting I would never ever cheat and I worked out very very hard with personal trainer for a LONG time till I just couldn't bear the continuous weight gain. 0 likes, 0 replies "

I've lost 20kg in 3 months and I've began to look anorexic, my hips were poking out and you could count my ribs.

I am still the same height and although i don't look as fat as back when i was 14 at the same height. Based on my heigh I'm 7kg overweight.  Now the thing is that i did exercise I used to run everyday and bike but exercise didn't show any effects so I've lost that weight purley by starving myslef. I've tried exercising again but in 2 months i haven't lost a gram nor look slimmer. I've given up and I honestly don't know what to do because i know even if i lost weight the yo-yo effect would come back and i would end up gaining twice what i lost. I hate exercise and i don't have much time to do it anyway. I leave the house 8am and come back 6pm and I'm usually tired and just want to relax. I gain weight super easily so even if i eat the same amount everyday i still somehow mange to gain weight. My family is pressuring me saying I'm overweight and I should stop eating and loose weight. I've never been able to accept the way i look and i have no motivation anymore. What can i do to loose weight once and for all?

He's gone down at least 2 Jean sizes unintentionally in a short space of time and is noticeably thinner than his previously healthy self. He says he has no appetite and is almost constantly nauseous so he isn't eating properly. On the rare occasion he does eat properly, he ends up vomiting. He struggles going to the bathroom and has stomach aches when he needs to go. When he stands he gets dizzy, often enough to lose his balance and fall over. He thinks it's a mixture of him no longer eating meat, a reduction in his antidepressants and no longer smoking canabis  (which he has for a few years up until the past couple of weeks) - because the quitting smoking is so recent I don't believe that to be the reason, although it obviously did help him to eat but I believe it was more working to help his appetite through an existing problem. He stopped eating meat around Christmas and I suspect help has a b12 deficiency so have been buying him vitamin supplements to try helping this. The medication he is taking is amitriptyline  (previously 100mg, now only 50mg)  He sometimes has very sharp sudden pains in the left side of his head that are strong enough to be debilitating. I'm very worried as he's  still losing weight rapidly, he won't eat and is just so down and miserable, I feel like I'm losing him and there's nothing I can do. Not even the very recent birth of our twin boys is helping to being him out of this and we all need him to be back to his previously happy, healthy self. I'm so worried this is something very serious and no doctor is picking up on it. Please if anyone has any insight or advice, please comment.

I am now about 96 pounds and it seems to keep dropping despite actively trying to eat fatty and protein rich foods. In January, after personal events I found myself consciously eating less. Emotional stress was high and I chose not to eat out of sheer not wanting to. I was not purposely starving myself, I ate throughout the day, but very little. Most nights I'd go to bed pretty hungry. Again, I was pretty depressed for awhile and this contributed to that. I did not actively notice weight loss until people began mentioning it and my clothes stopped fitting. I am on combination birth control if that helps anything. I am sexually active (one person) but mostly started taking birth control to help with my acne and have not really experienced any negative side effects from taking it. I feel that it is not until recently- the last few weeks, that I have really been struggling with eating and gaining weight. Before it was like I consciously chose not to, but now I have a stress and pressure to constantly plan out my meals and try to gain weight. My dad thinks a good amount of this is in my own head - my own stress and pressure on myself that is giving me anxiety and making it harder. I do have anxiety issues (not medically diagnosed but I do get anxiety a lot and tend to overthink a lot - stress from school, work, and personal relationships). I work at In-n-Out and do tend to sweat a lot and think maybe this is unintentionally playing a factor in some weight loss too but I don't know. Some symptoms I have had - nausea while/after eating, no appetite, early satiety, bloating. Recently but not consistently I have had stomach pain, a burning in my chest after eating, and tingling in my feet (happened a lot last night but was really only the first time I've noticed it. It was just so intense my foot began to feel numb, and only one of them). Last week, while attending a concert, I had to leave early as I got really sick. I'm not sure if it was due to the seats - highly elevated, very hot, and I felt suffocated. I had to sit down and when I tried to stand to tell my friend I wanted to get air, I could barely stand as my legs felt weak, and I immediately felt the urge to vomit. I gagged into a bag but barely anything came out. I began to get very bad cold sweats (felt cold sensations in my arms but was sweating sooooo much), i was short of breath, and could barely stand as I had weak shaky legs. This is the only time I've had something like this happen to me and don't know if it could have anything to do with my weight loss and a possible underlying medical issue or if it was a one time thing of stress, overheating, and being overwhelmed at a concert (And admittedly getting in my own head as i sat there and began to freak out i might be dying.) I do not use other medications and the only drugs I use are   (have been a user for years, never experienced any issues). I recently started smoking e-cigarettes and think this may account for my recent struggle with eating as I have read nicotine suppressed appetite, especially for sugary foods, and can raise your metabolism. However, can it really be that rapid and intense or is it more like losing a couple pounds a month type thing? I don't know any medical conditions that run in my family, except my grandma died of  diabetes I believe but I'm not sure what type (i remember seeing a picture of her at the end of her life being rather skinny though.) Any suggestions help and I mostly wanna know if i should be worried or if i may be in my own head. Thank you. 0 likes, 1 reply "

He also examined me briefly and concluded by saying that he doesn't think there's anything serious going on and sent me home. But I can't get rid of the anxious feeling that there's something wrong with me, and I don't know what else I can do.

My doctor recommended Prilosec, and Sulcrafate just in case I had an ulcer. She also ordered blood work which came back ok except for slightly elevated white blood cell count. This did not help whatsoever. I had an ultrasound of my abdominal area which showed nothing. I was then referred to a GI doctor who noticed when he palpated my upper abdominal area, I had pain. He sent off for a HIDA scan which showed I had bilinary  dyskinesia with a 17% efraction rate. We are at week 2 by this point. He suggested we go ahead and yank the gallbladder out which in a week we did. By this point I had noticed a significant appetite change and didn't feel like eating. I would never say this pain was triggered by eating fatty foods, just there all the time in a dull achey fashion. I had a cat scan around a week after surgery as I was still in strong pain. It was clear. This pain has continued on for several more weeks. I still have the constant pain that will not go away. One night the pain was so strong I headed to the ER which did more blood work and an additional CT scan, still clear, other than slightly elevated white blood cell count. My doctor suggested I should try Mayo Clinic which I did which performed more blood work( white blood cells not elevated) a upper endoscopy, a colonoscopy, and a ct enterography with oral and Iv contrast. They didn't find anything, Ive also noticed how suddenly I can't sleep anymore. I always have been a great sleeper but lately I have been having to take Tylenol pm, which still doesn't help a ton. I also notice food seems to run through me( not always diarrhea, just not digesting food very much and it running through me quick. I've lost 20 pounds and am at a slight loss. All tests from Mayo came back clear. I still have all the same pains this started with. My pain is mostly upper, middle back pain and epidermic area pain.

Cooking was always a passion of hers and she did it well. I was lucky enough to grow up eating gourmet meals thanks to her and she passed that love for food onto me. In recent years, however, my mother has lost this love and now even the thought of food disgusts her. She is 51 years old and has not eaten a full meal in months, maybe even a year at this point. A few years back, she was bullied pretty harshly at her old place of work, which was a school. She dreaded going to work so much she would vomit every morning before going in because she was that nervous to face the faculty. We noticed that on top of getting sick each morning, her hair started thinning, she had no desire to eat, and within months, would completely stop eating. For example, she would eat ONE BITE of a meal or snack and say, ""I'm full"". Currently, the thought of food disgusts her.  Many times, she either feels bloated or nauseous.  A few months back, she got full routine blood work done, and everything came back normal. She saw a specialist and got an endoscopy done, which also came back normal. She has always had high blood pressure, and an overactive thyroid, which to me, would not have a direct correlation with what's going on, but I could be wrong.  Overall, her mental health seems to be slipping a little as well. I don't know if this is related to stress, or her trying to cover up what's going on - but she repeats herself like crazy, which she has never done before. I'll hear the same story several times. Someone mentioned to me this could be linked to  ?  We just got back from my wedding, which was a destination wedding, and I noticed her behavior change. She was happy, she ate, did not vomit the entire trip, and was kind of full of life like I knew her to be in the past. It seems weird to me it could be switched on/off like this. She suffers from   (because of where we live) and said she noticed a difference when we were away. I know I'm kind of all over the place here, but I just want some answers and want my mom to be healthy again.

Weight Loss and Gain - Unintentional,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/loss-of-hunger-pots-like-symptoms-please-help-679647,"Loss of hunger, POTs like symptoms please HELP","I am at a complete loss for my current health situation, and if anyone has any info/tips it would be super helpful. I am a 21 year old girl, never any health problems and nothing of this sort runs in my family. One day at the beginning of June 2018 I woke up with terrible bloating and digestive issues after taking ibuprofen/aleve for a couple of weeks. I thought this was fluke as this has happened before, and I figured after a couple of days I would go back to normal. Nothing went back to normal and weird bowel movements still persisted. I thought I was facing some sort of IBD so I had a colonoscopy (all clear) endoscopy (all clear) - no H-pylori, no celiac disease nothing. Had full blood panel, thyroid tested, screened for auto-immune diseases, lyme, CT scan, all negative all NORMAL. At the beginning of July it escalated to the point of where I now never feel hunger I constantly feel full, it's been almost 4 months of feeding myself food. This is terribly stressful as I am in college and everyone wants to go out and eat and I feel as if that has been stolen from me. On top of all of this my heart rate has also been a major issue. Whatever has been going on has seemed to induce POTs syndrome like symptoms in my body. Laying my HR is at 60-75, standing it shoots up to 120-140, 160 on some mornings. I live in Florida and I used to LOVE the heat, now I can barely stand going outside because of whatever has been going on in my body. I haven't fainted which I am thankful for, but my symptoms appeared out of THIN air and I am so frustrated as to why and or how I have developed these mystery symptoms. I have an appointment with an Electrophysiologist tomorrow and I am demanding more testing and if he needs to send me to further specialists I will gladly go. I feel as if I am at the end of my rope and all of these symptoms are due to some genetic/point mutation in my body as it is unexplained. I'm not sure how to deal with forcing myself food for the rest of my life, or not being able to enjoy the outdoors/beach any more. This is the definition of living hell for a girl who is 21 years old to be going through such a bizarre unexplained illness or set of symptoms. If ANYONE has any sort of information and or tips/help to provide for me please do. I am at a complete loss and seeing all my friends enjoy day to day activities and go out on the weekends absolutely breaks my heart as I used to be the most happy/outgoing girl with everything ahead of me, and now I have the worst anxiety because I feel like a total freak and no one will ever want to be with someone so troubled. Keep in mind I look completely healthy and normal so it is very deceiving. please help and please do not tell me it's anxiety/depression related. If I could go back to June and not have any of this happen to me believe me I would. 0 likes, 0 replies "

The only suggestion was to put me on the pill. I went from being a size 8/10 to now being a size 18/20 which is a huge difference! Last year I went on a diet for about 8 months, I ate all the right things such as lean meats, drinking the recomended amount of water, vegies, fruits, fish etc! You name it! I also was going to the gym 4-5 days a week doing an hour cardio and half hour weights. In 8 months I did not loose any weight but went up a dress size!! Feeling frustrated and quite frankly really p****d off I stopped going and pretty much gave up.  A year on I recently found out I had a duodenal stomach ulcer which also makes you gain weight ..... Huray! -_- .... I've just finished taken my tablets to clear it so should no longer be there. I've also stopped taking the pill as that also contributes to weight gain. I now want to try loose weight again and was wondering if anyone had any tips they could share in regards to beating this weight gain, or how to try rebalance hormones or speed up metabolism? I currently only drink water and herbal teas, mainly green tea, peppermint tea and some immune and energy boost ones (the fruity ones!) I eat a lot of chicken at home! And the rest of my food intake is normal, a sandwich for lunch, a greek yoghurt or fruit for breakfast etc.  My body type is apparently endomorph which means I should stay away from carbs, so I'm thinking of trying out a low carb diet mixed with intermitten fasting, just wondering if anyone has any experience with any of these? I'm hoping to loose about 5-6 stone, mainly because it's effecting my general every day life, such as when I do activities I cant walk a lot or tire out really easily, also I get a lot of back pain etc. I also want to better my health, plus it would be nice to feel confident in my body again!  0 likes, 8 replies "

I am going to try and describe as best I can as to whats been happening to me recently and what I have currently done to try and sort my issues. So about 5 months ago maybe more I started losing a bit of weight, that didn't really matter as I had just come off a diet as I had   and thought my metabolism was working itself out. Then as the weeks went on my body got small and smaller to the point my wrists are tiny and my bones are way more visible on the arms and legs. I then started to get muscle twitching and spasms which freaked me out a bit so I went to the docs. At the doctors they did some standard tests like hitting my knees and elbows to check reaction, a coordination test, blood pressure and a few   to check levels. That was all 100% so because my GP took a look at my records and saw i used to be a bit anxious and I used to take medication so they wanted to see if it was my   causing the issues. this is where things went real down hill. they put me on sertaline which is meant to be a ""standard"" med for "" ?"". I took it for a month and noticed I couldn't actually feel my arms or legs because of numbness and I was incredibly weak. Had a look online and apparently sertaline is used to relax muscles in some cases. this is the opposite of what i wanted as i worked in a fast past dangerous environment. so I came off it. I went back to the doctors and said I need more specific tests and they didn't know what to recommend ?! so I had to go home and research what kind of tests I might need. The best I could come up with was to see someone in neurology as my legs and hands were going haywire with cramps, twitching and because my arms and legs were getting smaller ect. I went back and said I wanted to see one, they referred me and I have had a series of other tests, nerve conduction's , mri and   of brain and spine. all have came back fine, the guy that checked my nerves said that they are Benign twitches and that alot of people get them.  But I still have the problem of what the hell is going on with my body, why do i feel sick all the time and dizzy. They doctors said I need to look down less serious paths as they have ruled out tumours in the brain ,bleeding, any serious nerve disorders and imbalances. I have also checked for STI's because of the amount of partners I had in a sort period of time and that was good. So my question is whats next? I am not well at all and am losing the will at bit being told to pretty much sort myself out. I have had to leave work for a while. I don't know the specific blood testshey did but the one i had last night was around 5 tubes. that i think checked for more serious problems. Just to add that my stomach is always upset. I pretty much can't go no where without not eating for at least 3 hours prior otherwise your looking at a spout of stomach pains. though i have had that for years but it wasn't as bad as it is now. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I have been using clobetasol twice a day and Yuvafem twice a week.  However, my burning and irritation symptoms returned 2 days ago.  My doctor asked if i ate anything different in the last few days.  i told her I ate eggplant 3 days in a row.  She said that eggplant has high oxalates which possibly could havr caused the flare up.  She told me to keep using the clobetasol twice a day and increase the Yuvafem to three times a week since my vaginal ph is still high.  She also recommended using coconut oil to soothe the vulva.  I always use a baking soda wash after urinating.  She said that is fine.  I am wondering if anyone had a flare up due to high oxalate foods.  She wants to see me in a month to see how I am doing.

Vulval Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/how-i-cured-my-vulvodynia-613064,How I cured my vulvodynia,"I see so many posts on here about constant or provoked vulva pain that I thought it might be useful if I explained vulvodynia and how I cured mine. Vulvodynia literally means vulvar pain and is a condition of the nerves in that area. The nerves have become hyperactive and hypersensitive due to trauma which can be chemical or physical in source or due to infection. I think mine was due to persistent thrush infection and the many remedies I tried to cure it, including home remedies such as bathing in a bath with some cider vinegar in - that made my soreness much worse (chemical trauma). Vulvodynia can cause itching, sore or burning sensation and this can be continuous or provoked (only happens when the area is touched). The nerves are so hypersensitive they register touch as pain and the usual way to diagnose it is to touch around the vulvar area with a cotton bud and where the touch registers as pain then that is the affected area. It can involve the whole of the vulvar area or can be in a horseshoe shape toward the posterior (which may also involve the perineum) or the anterior or can be offset to one side. The pain is a form of chronic neuropathic pain because it stems from nerve damage as opposed to nociceptive pain which is caused by tissue damage. Neuropathic pain can be very hard to get rid of. It took me 1.5 years of determination and the occasional disappointing set back to cure my vulvodynia. Probably more like 2 years to get back to normal. Ok, ready for a long story about how I cured my vulvodynia:- First I saw a gynaecologist. He took a biopsy of the painful area and confirmed no diseases or cancer. He put me on amitriptyline and steroid cream. These slowly worked for a while and made me comfortable enough to have a long overdue smear test. I had the smear test and the pain came back full force - back to square 1. By that time I had used the steroid cream for as long as is recommended and had stopped it (long term use not recommended). However, desperate to get rid of the pain I tired it again, but this time the cream stung me and made the pain worse. The gynaecologist gave me lynocaine cream to numb the area, but that stung me and made me worse. Nothing was working and in the end the gynae said that he could not cure me he could just help me managed the pain. Well, I wasn't going to put up with that for the rest of my life. So I did some investigating to find someone else who could help me and found a dermatologist consultant in Oxford who specialised in vulva pain. I also found some medication on the internet, made in Italy which is a gel is specifically for treating vulvodynia. It calms down the overactive and hypersensitive nerves. Saginil gel  - you can order it direct from the suppliers, epitech, on their website. You can do this because it is not classed as a medicine because it is made of natural plant-based ingredients. It is expensive, as is the post from Italy, but I am so pleased I bought it because it was the only thing my skin could tolerate there and it did make a difference - it reduced the pain so that it was bearable and I could function better with daily life. i saw the dermatologist and she told me all the things that she had found worked to get rid of the pain, but nerve pain is difficult to get rid of so she suggested I try them all and stick at it. i was surprised because, appears from upping the amitriptyline dose to 50-70mg a day (I was on 20), the rest of the things were what you would class alternative, or natural, cures. They were: western acupuncture, physiotherapy, chiropraction and manual desensitisation. Now, different things work for different people because there are different causes for the vulvodynia: infection, physical or chemical trauma, hormones, trapped nerve in back. I knew mine was caused by repeated and persistent thrush and the various treatments I tried to get rid of it (including cider vinegar - ouch! No!). So I didn't see a chiropractor because is didn't thing it stemmed from a pelvic nerve problem, however, from what you describe, yours might. I did do yoga exercises that free trapped pelvic nerves. I bought a book on pelvic floor exercises and did those, rather than see a physio. I did the manual desensitisation - this is where you stroke yourself very lightly in the painful area, using non-irritating lubricant (I used oil based lube by yes, or coconut oil), just once the first day. Then each day you gradually build up the strokes in number and pressure. The idea is that you are retraining the nerves to register touch as touch and not pain. So, massage yourself there just enough so as not to cause lasting pain afterwards. I built it up until I could do 100 strokes of fairly good pressure, then I moved into inserting a finger, then two, then the tip of my husband's penis and then gradually out him in a little further each time, until I could get most of him in, then starting moving with him in, again gradually building it up each time. I also found a GP that also ran a Western acupuncture clinic. Western means that they leave the meddles in and pass electricity through them. That was what really worked for me - each time I went I just got better and better. Apparently the amitriptyline and the acupuncture work well together to dampen down those hyperactive and oversensitive nerves. I upped the amitriptyline to 50mg as day, very gradually by 5mg every 1 or 2 weeks because it caused side effects so my body needed to adapt to each increase.  Finally, there are the changes to how you live. No tight clothes, no sex (until you are ready), no exercise (I gradually built that up too but walking just a short distance and gradually increasing it - never do an amount that cause she lasting pain). Go knicker free if you can - I work mainly from home so was able to go around with no knickers on and baggy jogging bottoms or a skirt. Sitting also caused problems (I work at a computer) so I got a ring shoved cushion form woman to use after they have given birth and sat in that so that there was no pressure at all on the sensitive area (dame for driving the car). Coconut oil was soothing (raw, cold pressed, organic coconut oil) so I applied that externally and internally with a clean finger after every time I went to the loo (I carried a little pot in my hand bag so I could apply it while out and about with an organic, pesticide and bleach free cotton pad). No scented products on that area, in fact I didn't wash there at all, I used coconut oil to clean the area and when showered I used organic, nasty chemical free and scent free body wash and shampoo and conditioner (because stuff runs down). I also washed my clothes in scent free, kind-to-skin laundry detergent and conditioner. Toilet paper has bleach in it, so I got some tissues that were bleach free and used those to wipe after doing a wee. The key is to be persistent, try everything, gradually build things up, stick with what works, be determined, don't give in. The consultant dermatologist was very impressed with me because I was so determined and didn't give into urges. She said she had many women who just got fed up with how long it was taking and just went for a long walk / bike ride / horse ride or had sex and put themselves back at square one again. It does take a long time - it took me 1.5 years of all that stuff in my message above to get to being pain free. Even now, 5 years later, I still apply coconut oil after every time I go to the toilet, use tonnes of oil based lube during intercourse, go around the house wear no knickers. I don't want it to come back. I am also still on 50mg amitriptyline a day. At first I was afraid to come off it because the consultant dermatologist told me, you may be pain free, but if you come off it too soon, the pain can come back. So it is best to wait a few months after being pain free. Then menopause set in and I got hot flushes and my GP told me to stay on the  amitriptyline because it helps with hot flushes. My body has adapted to it now. I hope to reduce the dose sometime (gradually, by 5mg very 2 weeks, just like I built it up). I still do pelvic floor exercises - the book I got was called 7 steps to pain-free sex by Claudia Amherd. It is mainly about vaginismus, but the exercises apply to vulvodynia too - just don't do them sitting on a juggling ball (ouch) do them standing up first, then lying down, as it advises in the book. Gradually build up the exercises, doing more and more each time. Again, don't do so much that it causes an increase in pain or lasting pain - cut back if that happens. Also, you need to get some organic, chemical free sanitary towels for when you have your period (no tampons).  4 likes, 505 replies "

I asked the nurse if it was normal if it would be that high, she said yes that it won't got up to 190 and that it takes up to three months to know if the wpw will stay away or not. Pulse have been in the upper 100s. I went to go get an EKG done just to double check and everything came out normal.  they reassured me it was normal and that my heart needed time to heal.

Vertigo and Dizziness,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/have-bbpv-not-sure-if-i-should-try-the-epley-maneuver-692458,"Have BBPV, not sure if I should try the Epley Maneuver","I've had BBPV for the last two weeks, and am trying to decide whether or not to get the Epley Maneuver done. I would go to a physiotherapist as I would not want to try it on my own. I am hoping for any advice anyone can give!! I should first mention that I've had vertigo three times before - once in 2016, once in 2017, and once last December. Those three times, it only lasted a few hours. It was positional but would be provoked by different head movements than my current bout. Those three times, I simply lay in bed in a ""good"" position until the vertigo went away on its own (i.e. until the head movements no longer triggered it). My current bout of vertigo began two weeks ago (Jan 13). I woke up in the middle of the night, lying on my right. When I went to turn left, I felt the spinning and immediately recognized it as vertigo. So I turned back to the right and fell back asleep. For the next four or so days, lying on my right was perfectly fine, and getting up and going about my day was perfectly fine, but when I tried to turn left lying down, the intense spinning would start before I could complete the left turn, and so I would give up and turn back to the right and the spinning would stop right away. By the fifth day, fortunately, my condition seems to have improved somewhat. I can complete the left turn and it is only a few seconds after I reach the pillow with my left side that the vertigo kicks in, and it just feels like a lurch forward followed by a few seconds of vague, low-intensity spinning. Nothing like the intense, fast-beating spinning I triggered during the first four days. Five days ago (Jan 22), I went to the dentist to get my teeth cleaned, and when I got out of the chair, I started feeling like my eyes were darting around as I walked to the bus stop. When I got home, I tried to lie down on my right and this triggered vertigo (like I was falling into the pillow). So I actually slept on my left that night (which I had been completely avoiding since Jan 13). The next day, I sometimes felt like I was swaying when I was walking, and felt heavy-headed and off-balance. But by Jan 24, the swaying was gone, walking was fine, and lying on the right was normal again. So, essentially, I've gone back to just the pre-dentist, left-ear vertigo, where turning left lying down triggers the lurch and low-intensity vertigo. My guess is that I have left-ear posterior-canal BPPV, and that the dentist's chair may have triggered a short episode of right-ear BPPV (not sure which canal). I did go to a walk-in clinic and the doctor says it's BPPV. He looked in my eyes with me walking and with me moving my head while sitting and he observed no nystagmus. But, he didn't do the Dix-Halpike test or ask me to lie down and trigger the vertigo, so he didn't observe me with vertigo. He prescribed Serc and suggested I go to physio for particle repositioning. Fortunately I haven't had any nausea this entire time. And, aside from the post-dentist time (1-2 days), I haven't felt off-balance or light-headed. Based on all this, I have some questions... If anyone has any advice relating to any of these questions, it would be very much appreciated. Thank you so much for reading! 0 likes, 20 replies "

We discovered that I could miss 2 injections and if I had the 3rd shot on time I didn't tip into the dizzy spell.

Unfortunately both my parents had bad vericose veins and both had them stripped (both legs).  Luckily for me, it wasn't until I had my son 14 yrs ago that mine started becoming a problem.  Only on one leg and not nearly as unsightly as my parents had.  However, still problematic, and ugly. I had my surgery in June 08, again fortunately for me, the surgeon is labelled as one of the best.  However, 5 months on, I have found recovery to be very painful and slow.  Unlike the last thread I read, I was not able to walk properly without pain and without wanting to faint until 3 weeks later. My appetite decreased significant, and panadol did not manage the pain well.  I was bed ridden and nauseas, with postural hypertension because of lowering of blood pressure.  Showering, my only 'feel good', was terribly traumatic.  I passed out hitting my head on my stone tile flooring, still experiencing pain from possible cheak fracture, which my GP didn't diagnose properly or treat.  Pain was unbearable for some time.  I could not drive, am a mother recently separated with a huge mortgage and was unable to work for 3 weeks.  This time unpaid.  The stockings were distressing, (I had no support or home help) swelling and bruising horrendous.  It wasn't until I saw my physio some 2 months later, she encouraged massage of incision points and exercise to stop scar tissue.  Again, 5 months on, I feel deep tissue, nerve pain when I try to exercise. I feel the cold much more, and foot still turns purple at times. I am frustrated that I am unable to use my gym membership and at times feel depressed about the lenghth of recovery.  This has been a long journey.  I was hoping to learn how to surf with my boyfriend at New Years.  But, I think I'll be saving that til 2010.  Bumma  6 likes, 138 replies "

I'm mainly writing for my father - who was diagnosed November 2017 with MPA. Here is the timeline in condensed form of his development: - Late November, blood in sputum - Late December, admitted to ICU with kidney failure and lung filled with blood - 3 week ICU stay including ventilator support, continuous dialysis, and immunosuppresants - 2 cycles of cytoxan total during 4 week stay in hospital. once a week cycle of rituxan (4 total) - He came home with great lung function, creatinine at 2.7 (no dialysis) and down to 2.5 after a month. - Weekly physical therapy, on large doses of prednisone and tapering My father is in decent health, but I believe he is getting impatient. I've explained that people don't kick this disease after 3 months from diagnosis, I think he was optimistic because the improvement was so drastic in the first several weeks he was off the ventiator. Now that the progress is slowed, he feels like he's back tracking. I wanted to ask the group if they've experienced the following: - Small amounts of blood still in sputum (only in mornings) - NEW symptoms that he's never experienced before AFTER being sent home from the hospital after his first rounds of immunosuppresent infusions - this one mainly being joint pain in his knees (having trouble walking on it) Are these normal? He's scheduled for more rituxan 6 months after he's left the hospital (in July,) but i just wanted to make sure he's experiencing typical symptoms pre-remission.

I have been to the doctor 3 times and have had bloods done which indicated apparently it isn’t GCA ( unlikely due to my age also,  late 30’s) And the Doctor assures me it isn’t the temporal artery although it does pulsate. According to him it must be stress! I have also developed pulsatile tinnitus when lying down. I have had a MRI & MRA recently too which hasn’t picked up the problem. I feel like I can’t go on like this and am spending more and more time in bed feeling dreadful.. Please can someone give me some advice on where to go next. I’m happy to go private but do I see a neurologist or rheumatologist. Is there more specific tests for autoimmune conditions? I feel I need to see someone who is going to investigate this properly and not keep fobbing me off, something is causing this and the NHS don’t seem willing to do anything else for me.  I’d be so thankful for any advice!  0 likes, 1 reply "

Gradually eliminated all things to which I was sensitive from my house/diet, had carpeting removed from house, replaced curtains w/blinds, waterproofed basement, avoided doctors, closed my business & rested as necessary, addressed past traumas in my life, replaced wardrobe w/100% cotton or linen or silk, changed the color of my walls & kitchen cabinets to brighten my environment - did whatever I felt might help me heal, crazy or not, expensive or not. March 2018: Eventually, after hounding my HVAC company about smelling mold & feeling sick when I turned on my A/C, I contacted a different HVAC company that directed me to a person who could test my house for mold.  Numerous people had searched for mold in my pristine house, that neither looks or smells like it could contain mold, but this guy found it right away - all through my duct work & HVAC system.  I replaced the HVAC system, to which I had an electronic air cleaner added, had the duct work vacuumed and cleaned w/an antimicrobial product, and had a dehumidifier installed in my basement. My symptoms disappeared immediately. I wish this result for all of you. 0 likes, 2 replies "

Vasculitis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/3-months-of-illness-and-no-where-to-turn--664834,3 months of illness and no where to turn :(,"Hello, I'm a 33 year old mum of 2 and for the past 3 months I've been through a awful time. It all started off I was experiencing the most intense deep burning pickles all over my body. They would come and go in different parts, I was at first describing it as an itch, but it was far more intense. I went to my doctor who sent me for a CBC and an allergy, diabetes blood tests, all came back fine. I proceeded to get on with life but 2 weeks on, I started to notice small pink circles appearing on my chest and inside my arms. They would come up and last around 24/48 hours. When they would disappear, new ones appeared.  I was then put on anti histamines, they never worked. The prickling was getting worse, and one evening coming home from work, I got undressed, and noticed a large bruise on my thigh that appeared with no known cause.  I had been suffering with a severe pressure headache and felt unwell, so took myself to be checked at the hospital. They ran bloods and again all come back normal, however the doctor did mention Vasculitis and I'm to see my doctor. So i went to my doctor who gave me a course of steroids, and referal to a dermatolist for further investigation on my skin flares. I got seen rather quickly as I got a cancellation, however the dermatologist I saw said he couldn't do any biopsy as my skin looked clear as since taking the steroids, my skin had calmed.  I explained all my symptoms and was quite distressed as the burning and prickling pricing is invisible and he just couldn't reassure or help me in any way. Anyway, another werk or 2 have gone by and I am now experiencing new severe symptoms of what seems nerve pain in my hands. It comes and goes but when the sharp sudden shooting pain in my fingers comes on it almost has me in tears. I have lowered my steroids as the doctor has told me to seen myself off, and now I'm noticing the pink raised spots on my chest are coming back. I also notice that when I get this sharp burning prickling sensation, I have tiny purple dots come up on the skin. I feel like the doctors are looking at me like it's all anxiety related, and I'm so fed up beyond words. I have a one year old daughter and 7 year-old son and before 3 months ago, I was a happy energetic mum who was in good health. I am only anxious because of what I am experiencing and not seeming to get any answers. I also the past week have been having the shakes, my arms are very weak and having severe pressure headaches. Could this be to do with the steroids? I am here because of the doctor in the hospital mentioning his concern of vasculitis. However my doctor is very dismissive of anything as all my blood tests have come back normal. This has made me anxious and I am so worried. I know something's not right and I don't know what to do next. I just want treatment and to get to the bottom of this. Does this sound anything like vasculitis related and if so what do I or my doctors need yo be doing? I really appreciate anybody's time, Thank you  0 likes, 4 replies "

It was spent in Drs offices and labs and lounging on the couch. It's refreshing to read others have similar symptoms.  However, it also seems none of us are getting real answers as to the core of this sometimes debilitating disorder. Mine starts with hives on my head that travel down and typically settle in my eyes.  Imagine the stares I get especially when out with my 6'4"" beau.   Yes, lots of facial swelling, and don't get me started on the bruising!  Then it moves into my shoulders, down the spine and across to the hips.  My back cannot be touched for about 36 hours.  Once that subsides, it shows up in my butt and down my legs.   I can't leave out the most interesting symptom yet...liver hematoma.  You want pain?  That was excruciating! Not that my back doesn't knock me over but that organ pain was awful. So, yes, I, too, have internal bleeding with no induced trauma. Really?  What the hell is going on here?  Why?  How can I relieve this pain when ibuprofen is off limits? I've done   for months at a time.  Drs don't want me on it for any length of time and I'm in agreement.   There's talk about starting a form of chemo but I know nothing about this and need to do some research. What I do know is there isn't enough info on UV.  I'm learning a lot by what I've experienced thus far.  It's painful & ugly.   I used to have beautiful skin.  Now, I have red butterfly rash, dry, flaking skin whenever in a flare (more often than not), and bruised swollen eyes upon waking.  That was some fight during the night.  I wonder what the other girl looks like. 😂  I can't do anything strenuous because they're afraid of more internal bleeding.  Wrap me in bubble wrap! The latest is pain behind and in my eyes which caused the blood vessels to break making me look like a zombie on Halloween.  The pressure was horrible and came forward yesterday making me look, once again, like I'd been in a bar room brawl.  I turn to Rocky and say, 'Cut me, Mick!' How many times before I have permanent damage to the optical or retinal nerve?  What about the pressure on the eye?  Hello ophthalmologist! It's like it affects every bit of my body one area at a time, from day to day. Trying to enlighten those around me is difficult because they don't always see the symptoms and I feel I come across as a drama queen when I can barely walk some days.   Ugh!  Ok...I'm going to get some good rest and fight the good battle again tomorrow.   0 likes, 8 replies "

Sometimes I'm able to attain a weak erection, my penis is noticeably softer than it was before all of the issues I'm having. After orgasm my penis looses girth almost immediately. Furthermore I'm UN able to continue with intercourse even with a rest of 30 or so mins, I have always been able to go multiple rounds of intercourse with my wife without any issues previously. I have always been very sexually active without any issues what so ever. This issue us really causing me to feel low and my wife is concerned for me, which is impacting on her ability to be comfortable during intercourse. I'm considering a vasectomy reversal due to this. My doctor has arranged the usual blood tests, i.e to measure testosterone levels etc. I'm yet to receive the results. I can only maintain an erection through intense physical stimulation. I previously only needed to be visually stimulated, this is very frustrating for me. Furthermore im only able to maintain an erection during vaginal penetration whilst im on top of my wife with my wifes legs are pushed up and back, as this gives me more sensation in my penis.. i struggle to maintain an erection when my wife is on top or if we do it whilst i'm behind her. Im totally aware that those within the medical field will be totally dismissive of the vasectomy procedure being the culprit for my ED issue. However im a believer that not all people fit into the same category within current research, as we are all unique and no two people are exactly the same. Not all people's bodies will always react in the same way to the same situation.  Is there a way back from this mess without the use of drugs ?? Last night I failed to have an erection, even through intence visual and physical stimulation. I had consumed alcohol and did feel tipsy, I have always found alcohol enhanced my erections and sexual desire. This was very shocking for me. Due to this I reluctantly took 50mg of a viagra type pill that was prescribed by my doctor. It took well over 1 hour for it to work, I was able to have the best erection I've had I months. I don't want to take drugs to combat this issue, I'm becoming very depressed due to this. Has anybody out there had this issue resolved by having a vasectomy reversed??  I'm concidering having it reversed to hopefully fix my erection issues. Furthermore I feel as if my testicles have atrophied (shrunk in size) somewhat since the vasectomy. If there is scar tissue and atrophied testicles etc or general damage to my genital area could my body heal the the damaged tissues etc through having a reversal?? any information would be greatly appreciated, and many thanks in advance .liam 5 likes, 120 replies "

If anybody has any words of encouragement, I'd be so grateful... Suffer from recurrent MDD.  Had lots of episodes 😞 more than a dozen. Was OK on Venlafaxine past three years (that's my go-to drug as found SSRIs less effective). Reduced dose too low though in late autumn - lots of reasons; all seem pathetic now and I wish to God I hadn't. Crashed five days before Christmas (great). Responded by quickly slamming up dose, first to 150, then 225 and on 1 Jan to 300. Here I am, nearly eight weeks after relapse kicked off, exhausted, hopeless and fighting suicidal thoughts. Does anyone have any experience of a similar situation, where the Venlafaxine does kicks in after all? I am so afraid I've ruined my receptiveness to it by coming off it (misguidedly) a few times in the past. Seeing psychiatrist tomorrow, but I really don't want to add in anything else.

First week I felt a strange energy rush (like I'd drank waaay too much coffee) and intense nausea after every dose, threw up a couple of times after taking it on an empty stomach because I couldn't bring myself to eat. The nausea and energy rush are both gone now but I don't have much appetite still and getting some   and stomach cramps. I'm finding it hard to sleep as well, (though when I do sleep I have some very interesting vivid dreams) and feeling very tired and weak most of the time. I'm also very restless and agitated, with this awful new feeling of being SO bored of life and not wanting to do anything, even watching my favourite shows. My room is a rubbish tip right now & running out of clean clothes. The doctor will phone me on monday and I think he wants me to up the dosage as soon as possible. I want to do this too, as I've read that it works better on your mood after 150mg, and to be honest, as unpleasant as the physical symptoms are, I would put up with MUCH worse if they helped my depression and anxiety. I've taken fluoxetine, sertraline and citalopram in the past and felt absolutely no difference on any of them, good or bad, so I'm really desperate for this to work.  But I'm very nervous. My main fear is that the restlessness and boredom will increase too, because it makes me feel like I'm going to go crazy. Does anyone have any advice or have you experienced the restlessness I'm talking about? Thanks for reading! 0 likes, 11 replies "

I was on Citalopram 20mg for 15 years and for the past 2 it was no longer working for me anymore - I thought so. I was feeling quite down so decided to see a new psychiatrist. He put me on a cocktail of drugs to help with citalopram tapering and to introduce the Effexor XR. I started with 75mg of Venlafaxine plus 25mg Valdoxan and Xanax 1mg. The Dr said that by November I will be feeling great and only on the max dosage on Effexor I would need, 150mg. Suicidal thoughts, Insomnia,  , lost of appetite and anxiety. Couldn’t taste anything, which for me was very frustrating as food (and cooking) is one of my favorite things on earth. By November I was off of citalopran and on max dosage of Effexor. I decided to quit the other drugs, as I was feeling awful with the side effects. In December, I couldn’t take it anymore, stopped seeing the Dr and decided to start tapering Venlafaxine. It was when I first read the millions of forums about the nightmare that was to come out of this drug, it really scared the heck out of me. People really suffering out there and the Drs never ever advise about the withdrawal symptoms. I started reducing in 20mg per week till I got now to 25mg daily. It was bearable till I reached the 40mg, when I started having muscular pains, shiverings and numbness in my body which really freaked me out to the point I went to see a rheumatologist and a neurologist , thinking I was having a serious immune disorder. And it doesn’t stop there. Chills, headaches,  , brain zappings, flu like symptoms. After MRI and several other tests, the doctors couldn’t find anything. I still can’t believe the suffering that this drug causes... I just can function as a normal person anymore. The pain in my body is excruciating. I will start tomorrow on fish oil and vitamin B12 Complex with the hope it will ease the symptoms. I also read that Benadryl can help but is banned where I leave.

I was on 225mg a day. Before this I was on mirtazapine mertazapine for about 4 months. The first two months I felt great then the last two months I started to feel as if I wasn't in my body anymore, taking really bad panic attacks at night (to the point where I thought I was taking a brain hemirage and my sister and friend phoned an ambulance for me.) having to walk out of work for bursting in to tears for no reason and snapping at people for no reason. Before this I was on citalopram for 3 years which was fine until I was on the highest dose and felt it wasn't working for me anymore. I am being taken off venlafaxine as it messes with my sleeping terribly (lucid dreams,   to the point where i wake up and my full bed and pyjamas are soaked with sweat, shouting in my sleep to the point people where scared! and generally being overly tired all the time. I was taking 225mg a day, my psyciatrist gave me orders to miss a day then take 75mg and continue for 8 before starting 5mg Vortioxetine(brintellex) for one week and continue with 10mg. I am now on my second day without anything as I have decided I want to see if I can manage without being on an anti depressent. I also take a mood stabiliser (lamotrigine 300mg daily) this was 200mg but was upped to 300mg when the venlafaxine was dropped to 75mg, I assume to help with the mood swings and emotions which come with the withdrawals. The beginning of the tapering in week one was extremely difficult (missing a day then taking 75mg the next) I had no control whatso ever with my emotions. Crying uncontrollably one minute then in hysterics the next. At absolutely nothing. head shocks. fuzzy eyes. diziness. blacking out for a second. panic attacks. severe   and tension. severe worry and guilt for no reason. anger, guilt, fear, sadness. overthinking and rational thoughts. muscle jerks. weight loss. night sweats, nightmares, insomnia, sleep paralyses, racing heart,  , heart flutters, feelings of falling when awake, flu like feelings, nausia, sickness, bowel problems and feelings of a full bladder or tingling in bladder. shaking, confusion. shaking and trembling inside. going from freezing to over heating in seconds. the last 2 days of that week the withdrawals started dying down. YOGA and excercise has helped massively with taking control of my thoughts and being aware of whats happening to my body. Going with the flow helped me, instead of thinking of past events or future possibilities, i tried focussing on what was hapening there and then and being honest about it and thinking rationally instead of with emotion. meditation and   helps with this type of calmness and controll. also using brainwaves (google the different types for the different states you can send your brain in to) closing your eyes and focussing on your breath whilst lying down really sends you in to a relaxed state with a clear mind. i tend to start with counting my breaths in throgh the nose out throug the mouth 12 times then i tend to pray for the half hour as i believe when you open your mind to an altered state you should protect yourself from UNKNOWN forces. unknown meaning we dont know enough about altered states or dreaming. i also use crystals for this purpose. drinking plenty of water and lemon has helped also. i am now on day two with 0mg and am beginning to feel the heart flutters and chills and head zaps again. I am hoping this is not just the beginning and things are going to get worse. my head has started doing over time researching in to what to do. Has anybody had the same situation before? I Dont know i am doing the right thing. i have yoga in the morning again which tends to tire me out later and helps me sleep at night. i will see how day 3 goes on 0mg. wish me luck! 1 like, 16 replies "

Vertigo and Dizziness,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/off-balance-and-feeling-weird-when-walking-for-2-years-not-running-620777,"Off balance and feeling weird when walking for 2 years, not running","Hi there I am hoping someone can help me out with debilitating symptoms that have been going on for almost 2 years. Just some general info about myself: F, 26 years, normal weight, vegetarian for 20 years. I'll try to keep the story short but there is a lot to explain, so here goes nothing... My health problems started in the beginning of 2016 where I would feel off balance/dizzy mainly when walking which got worse when I would try to look around a lot. The feeling exactly how I felt is difficult to describe but included feelings of swaying, sometimes caught by surprise of my own movement, weak legs etc. Went to the doctor, did some usual tests and   (whole blood count, iron, thyroid, liver, kidney etc.) and everything came back clear, but slight tachycardia at the time (90 bpm rest or so) so I was sent for heart tests (echo, stress test, ecg's, 24 h Holter) but nothing was found so my heart was cleared at the time. I should mention here that I did mention being a vegetarian and questioning my B12 levels, so these were checked too, but the doctor diagnosed them as being fine (which turned out to be a misdiagnosis 6 months later, at levels of 189...). Time went on, about 6 months of walking around with these symptoms, when things really got worse and I would feel very faint at times, super unbalanced when walking, very anxious, sweating a lot and chest tightness. Revisited the doctor, all the tests again were fine, except my B12 which dropped to 98 at the time. Was put on oral cyanocobalamin (4mg/day for 2 weeks and from then on 1mg/day). Despite having B12 medication things regarding my balance remained the same or got worse at days. I think it is during this time of all the worrying that I also developed an  /panic disorder. Brought myself 3 times to the ER thinking something was massively wrong, because of my off balance feelings, extreme feelings of being uncomfortable in my chest (very warm, tight, heart   often happening after lunch). ER did the usual tests and found nothing but high heart rate which was attributed to it being a panic attack.  That brings us to now, where I am seeing a psychiatrist for my anxiety disorder, but I believe there is a medical underlying condition that is not detected yet. During the last year I got too scared to work out thinking my balance got worse. Recently though I forced myself to go back to run 5k's which I loved doing before all of this happened. And this is when I got surprised: When I run I don't notice ANY of the symptoms. My body feels strong and I am able to pull of a 5k in about 26 mins, which is pretty decent for me considering I have not worked out in about 10 years. However, as soon also here when I am done with the run and start walking again this horrible off balance feeling is back! I can't stand this any longer. The off balance feelings I feel are always there but the severity degree is very dependent on the day or time of the day. Usually a lot worse towards the end of the day and also in the weekend which are often accompanied with some weird eye strain/ . Also seems that when I have had bad anxiety/an attack it takes a toll on my balance that requires a couple days to go back to more normal levels, truth is the balance issues are always there in some degree or another. I am just hoping to find answers to what could be going on. Could it be permanent damage from my B12 deficiency, of course also scared of MS or some other undiagnosed disease or could it really all be part of my anxiety disorder. Are there any of you that can find themselves in these symptoms/have any tips/advice?  I'd greatly appreciate any input as it seems I can't enjoy life like I used to and want my old normal carefree life back...

Vertigo and Dizziness,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/dizziness-and-unstable-feeling-for-2-years-696203,Dizziness and unstable feeling for 2 years,"I am 35 year old male in fairly healthy condition. No major problems in my life other than moderate Asthma and chronic sinusitis. Over 2.5yrs ago I started to feel a little “off” as far as foggy brain and sometimes feeling like I could pass out at any moment, It felt like my brain wanted to shut down. Other very mild symptoms were some middle dizziness, hard time focusing, vision at times felt a little blurry. This seemed to start after the summer of 2016 where I had 2 separate incidents (May and October) at a music festival where I passed out while on cocaine and ecstasy. I’m not a hard core drug user but I do enjoy from time to time. Please don’t judge all this on this one little detail. I do not have a drug problem and I know that. My friends and fiance can attest to that. But I do wonder if this problem I’m experiencing spawns from that. The medical staff that I woke up to didn’t seem too concerned but some of my friends/witnesses think I had a seizure (some shaking and eyes rolled back). They checked my blood sugar level and I got up and walked out on my own after about a ½ hour without being checked on. I learned later from research that a cocaine induced seizure is possible. What actually happened to me? I’ll never know for sure. I felt fine into the fall of 2016 then I started feeling off most of the time. This “feeling a bit off” continued sporadically for about a year until it started becoming a little more regular and sometimes intense in the winter of 2017. Symptoms included mild brain fogginess, tired all the time and wanting to sleep most of the time. It mostly seemed like a constant fatigue with some light headedness. During this time my exercise level was fairly low, snowboarding from time to time and the occasional hike. I lived in the mountains at the time and my living situation was stressful and un-enjoyable. I spent most of 2018 spring and summer feeling this way but always assumed I just wasn’t getting very much exercise and battling fatigue. All this time I also had no smell, battled allergies daily and stuffed up most of the time. I’ve also most of my life had a hard time getting regular sleep. 4ish hours a night was a regular thing. Late summer 2018 is when I started to really feel the symptoms getting worse and a lot heavier. After traveling to Spain in September for 2 weeks, I got home and went to the doctor with complaints of: Dizziness Lightheadedness trouble focusing sensitivity to light and sound the sensation of weightlessness and moving to fast when sitting still headaches and neck aches every day feeling of losing consciousness ringing in ears pressure in my head/temples and sinuses Daily headaches At the time I was seeing a medi-cal doctor and his first thought it was my sinuses so we tried lots of steroids, 3 different antibiotics, 2 blood tests (both came back with no problems), diet change, sleep pattern change and a CT scan that showed my sinuses were completely backed up. In November of 2018 I switched to Kaiser network and started seeing an ENT that confirmed I had major nasal polyps that we had removed with endoscopic surgery on 1/2/19. I also had allergy tests done which all came back very mild to all allergens. My fiance and I were in high hopes that this was the answer to the problem. After the surgery the ENT told me they didn’t think this was causing the dizziness and other symptoms and referred me to a Balance specialist. For 2 months now I’ve been working with them to do physical therapy to correct what they believe to be an imbalance with my vestibular system. So far no changes and my symptoms are getting worse and more intense everyday. For the last few weeks I’ve actually been feeling the sensation of things being out of place. Like for instance, I’ll see my trash can out of the corner of my eye and get the feeling it’s my cat. When I look over, I see the trash can and know that is what it was the whole time. Blind spots and blanking out are regular feelings now. I’m also experiencing heavy sensitivity to light and sounds. Piercing/loud sounds are startalling. My ENT told me they are at the end of their knowledge on this topic but he did do some research and suggested I might have a form of silent migraines (migraines without pain but experience persistent migraine auras). He suggested to look into this and he updated my GP with this theory and situation. A quick research on the internet returned several reads about Persistent Migraine Aura (PMA) that explains most of the symptoms I have. I’ve been asking the doctors over and over if it could be a neurological problem. This past week I went to my GP and went over the latest details including the migraine idea. My GP quickly dismissed this idea as he had never heard of such a thing. Very frustrated at this point I asked again if this could be neurological and explained the recent audio/visual sensations I’ve been seeing and he called the Neruo department and they ordered an MRI. They said they want to rule out any organic diseases and if that comes back clean then they want me to see a phyciatrist. They want me to see a phyciatrist because of the recent “hallucinations”. I really don’t think that this is a mental issue, as it is so physical in nature. Am I wrong? My doctor didn’t do a good job of explaining why they think this. So I’m suppose to go talk to someone about all this, but in the meantime my physical symptoms are getting worse. I can’t even get up and walk down the hallway to the bathroom without feeling dizzy and the sensation of going to fall over. 0 likes, 9 replies "

Vertigo and Dizziness,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-boyfriend-was-cured-from-labyrinthitis-naturally-594699,My boyfriend was cured from labyrinthitis naturally,"Hello Everyone, From those of you suffering from acute or chronic labyrinthitis, which causes symptoms of   and  , my boyfriend and I came across a natural cure and would like to share with you in hopes that it helps someone out there that is suffering. My boyfriend was battling it for a month and we didn't see it getting better. He was taking medication for the vertigo, which helped when he was taking it, but sudden movements would make him spin, everything would make him dizzy even driving, and his eyes would move rapidly back and forth. So I did some research and came across a smoothie that is used primarily for digestion, but it helps reduce inflammation, which is what causes labyrinthitis because your inner ear is inflammed so it throws you off balance. He was drinking the smoothie every morning and taking the medication for vertigo (I think it's the same thing you take for motion sickness) and within weeks he was off the medication and back to his normal self. It's been about 6 months since he was cured and THANK GOD it hasn't came back. The smoothie that he took consisted of: papaya (about 1/2 cup to 1 cup, depends on the size of your blender), pineapple (about 1/2 cup to 1 cup), homemade kefir (1/2 cup, you can buy the grains online or in store and search videos on how to make it, very easy), coconut milk (about 1/2 cup to 1 cup), papaya seeds (1/4 cup to a tablespoon, some papayas may not have enough seeds so just use what you can and make it last a few days so you don't have to keep buying payayas. The bigger papayas usually have more seeds. You only need to do 1/4 cup for about 2 weeks and then you can do tablespoon after that. Dont' stress if you can't do exactly 1/4 cup every time, just do as much as you can. Just start with more the first two weeks and move down to tablespoon after that.), banana (one banana) and honey (one tablespoon). WARNING: The smootie will make you poop so more payaya seeds=more poop. It's just cleaning you out so don't worry, if it's too strong start with less and work up. He took it for about a month or longer because we liked it so much. We haven't taken it in a few months now because we switched to oatmeal and fruits for breakfast since it's easier to prepare lol I hope this helps!  0 likes, 34 replies "

They come regularly about every two minutes or so.  It sort of feels like a slipping sensation, a wave or a flush -- like I'm sort of dropping consciousness a bit -- and it seems related to the rhythm of my hear and my circulation, as well as to ringing and pounding in my ears and a bit of a pounding all over.   It is also often accompanied by pins and needles in my legs, and tingling on my left side. I'm a 48 year old generally healthy female with a stressful traveling lifestyle. I've been to a neurologist and that came back negative, had an   / heart scan and that was OK. I've had extensive blood work and it all came back normal.  At the end of the month I've having tests done at a diagnostic audiology clinic to see if I have dizziness related to issues with my lower ear. My feeling is that it relates more to my overall circulation since it also seems to be related to pounding in my heart... but I have no idea. It's a scary and bothersome thing that doesn't go away.

This condition is hell! I am dizzy and nauseous 95% of the time with lots of ear and head pressure. When I get really dizzy and sick I also get diarrhoea.

I have started seeing a physio and have been doing VRT exercises for a week which have made me feel much worse. I used to have the odd few hours where I felt okay but not in the last couple of weeks.  Can it get worse before it gets better?  Reading, writing, typing, watching TV all make me feel Worse too.  I feel like there is literally no pleasure in my life right now and I can't even get relief in my sleep.  I have two kids and have kept as a active as possible, caring for them and trying to keep life normal for them so I haven't been hiding away.   I don't seem to have had the acute stage at the start which slowly improves, I've just been the same for about 8 weeks and worse for the last two. im scared I'll,never get better. I would love to hear from anyone who did get better after this time, or at least improved enough to enjoy life again or who was able to return to work.  Did VRT help anyone out there and how long did it take for you to notice improvements?

This ""brain fog"" I am talking about is a feeling of complete mental confusion, I have no memory, I cannot concentrate on anything, it feels like there's a dark blanket on my brain clouding all my thoughts. I have extreme disorientation and haziness. I feel like I'm always in a dream like state.  I am constantly dizzy and feel a pulling sensation, as if I'm ready to fall over at any moment. It feels like there's air inside my head, and I'm always very lightheaded. Whenever I try to drive I feel this pulling sensation pulling me down.  Another problem I have is with my vision. I am having very blurred vision and have double vision. Everytime I look at something up close it is extremely blurry and I cannot see at all. My perception on things has completely changed. I feel like everything looks very odd and strange and I don't have the right depth perception. It's like I'm in a horrible dream like state all the time.  I have been having headaches and head pressure as well, and having horrible pains behind my eyes. The pin starts from the back of my head close to my neck and continues up my head and the sides of my temples. My eyes hurt so bad, and it feels like knives are jabbing my eyes. My head also feels extremely heavy all the time.  All these symptoms have been causing me severe anxiety, and I have been having panic attacks from them and feel like I'm dying. It is causing a strange disrespity sensation, where I feel like I'm not even here anymore and there's a detachment from myself and my body. I have had to drop all my classes at college and quit my job because these symptoms make me lay in bed all day long. I have been unable to drive for months and can barely get up to walk around. If anyone could please help me or know anything as a suggestion to try.  I have been to my general doctor, 2 ENTs, 1 neurologist, have had 2 MRIs, a hearing test, VNG, multiple blood tests, and no one knows what is wrong. I can't live like this anymore.

I have had blood work done in November last year and my white blood count was a little high but not concerning and everything else was normal....no diabetes. Also had a stress test done on heart and was normal. I am at my wits end with this cause I don't know what's going on. I plan to see an eye doctor soon.

I thought this was because of the medication I was on at the time (zoloft) as it can be a side effect but I've been off the medication for a while and I'm still getting this issue.I was also only on them for four days so I don't think it's because of the medication. I started getting constipation issues which I now believe to be a coincidence and that went away. But I still have this feling like I can't empty my bladder. I've been to the doctors about this a few times and done two samples for my doctor at different visits, one of them was tested by a lab as well but there was no signs of an infection. I think I'm not going as much either as in I will have a lot to drink but not go as much as I usually do after having that amount of liquids.

I have cold hives, and I am not sure why. Some possible causes are Celiac disease or Gluten intolerance,  , Thyroid Conditions, like Hypothyroidism. I have not been tested for any of these but I am almost 100% positive that I don't have any kind of Gluten Intolerance. However, after I eat anything whether it be a piece of toast or steak dinner I bloat. So it could be a stomach issue. Thyroid conditions I am not to sure, because I have not been tested, but according to google some symptoms are cold sensitivity and sensitive skin. Which I have both of. Anyway, I have also found that Quercetin works as like a natural antihistamine and the recommended dosage is 400mg twice a day. Antihistamines like Allegra (Allegra is the only one I've tried) don't work for me with keeping the hives away so would Quercetin? Also, could I get the reccomened dosage without taking the supplements. For instance, through black plums and blueberries and whatever? Thank you in advance 0 likes, 8 replies "

I asked to go to the toilet again (which was rather embarrassing considering I only just got back) and was told I needed to wait due to only one person allowed to use the toilet at a time. The intensity got slightly worse and I came over with some panic attack symptoms as well. I told the lecturer I felt ill and really had to go, I was allowed to go and when I got to the toilet I barely urinated again. I went outside to try and calm down in case it was an anxiety attack or something and the feeling hadn't disappeared but mostly subsided so I tried again. As soon as I sat down again the intense urge came back again... This has now been happening since. I almost constantly feel the urge to pee. I have recently started to get lower stomach aches which I have started taking paracetamol for. (The aches wasn't exactly painful, more uncomfortable than anything). Sometimes I'll get the urge and get to the bathroom and so little will come out, with a push I can get some out but it's still normally a trickle. This seems to happen some what of about 10-15 times a day. I have also a couple times had a slight pain when peeing (it was as though somebody was pushing their thumb into my lower stomach area).  The confusing thing seems to be that this has all seemed to appear out of nowhere. I never had any issues before the 14th and now I've almost become obsessed. I've barely been out because it seems to get worse when inside a car for more than 5 minutes or walking for about half a mile. I'm unsure if this is down to an infection and the movement making it feel worse or anxiety. I am also unsure if anxiety has lead me to completely image and believe my symptoms. I didn't have anxiety before and wouldn't have described the anxiety from the exams to be any more than ""normal"" for a student at this time.  I have been to my GP and told to do a Urine test which I am still waiting for the results even a week later.. The GP also said it seems unlikely to be positive because it seems unusual as it gets worse when going out.  Any information would be great. Do you think this sounds like an actual infection or purely in my head? How can I try to suppress the urination urges even when I know I don't actually need to relieve myself? What do I do if my urine test ends up being negative? 0 likes, 18 replies "

In 2005, in Canada, I was diagnosed with   and was treated with brachytherapy. Twelve years later, I had problems with my bladder and my urinary tract, problems that the doctors think were side effects of the radiation I received in 2005. My problems turned into  . I wear diapers 24/7. I also have some fecal incontinence. I've had it for at least six months. So far, it appears limited to urgency –– i.e., when I feel that I have to go to the toilet, I have only about 90 seconds to get there. I am wearing diapers anyhow, for the urinary incontinence. But so far, I haven't had any ""leakage"" of stools into the diapers. I have always managed to get to a toilet in time. And the urge seems to happen only when I am at home. I have been thinking about having an artificial (urinary) sphincter implanted. But one of the main reasons for doing so is so that I don't have to wear diapers all of the time. But if I have the procedure, I wonder whether I will have to wear diapers anyhow because of my other problem. If my fecal urgency does not get any worse, I could wear a diaper, for safety, but not have to be changing diapers all day and all night. Does anyone here have experience with this? Is my fecal urgency problem likely to get worse? Am I likely to have other problems associated with fecal incontinence? Am I better off just sticking with the diapers? Thanks. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I went to use the bathroom and my pee lasted a while. There was a normal stream and then I kept dripping for almost 10 mins. It got increasingly worse. Eventually I was standing over the toilet for 30 to 40 minutes. And sometimes during those spands of time the pee feels like it is about to come out but it doesn’t always. When I finally think I’ve been standing there for long enough (even though I still have to pee), I finish up and go to wash my hands. The pee then still drips for a little bit on to my pants and underwear. But I want to make this clear, I always feel like I have the need to pee but its urgent, like a UTI. I was tested for a UTI, and I don’t have one. I also had bladder examinations and invasive tests on my urethra, both these tests came up with nothing. I was prescribed alpha blockers, but the doctor said he didn’t even know if they would help, it’s just a guess. Here comes the worst part. I have lost of feeling in my penis. I have trouble getting erections because I just dont feel anything. I can only use my mind to get an erection if you know what I mean. When I do ejaculate 1 of 3 things can happen: nothing comes out, I get the feeling that I’m about to finish and no semen comes out and it just feels weird; pee and semen come out together; or it just kinda feels uncomfortable. Keep in mind while I’m doing these things I always feel like I’m pushing through the “I need to pee feeling”. Because of all this sexual drama, me and my girlfriend have not had sex for 5 months and we used to be very active sexually. This is driving her insane and me as well. Our relationship is pretty much ruined because of this and we are going to break up within the day. It’s really putting me into a deep depression, I can’t helo but feel like this issue will never go away and I will never be able to have sex again or be with my girlfriend again.

My uribe was sent off for further testing, again all clear.  My gp then sent me to a urologist who also couldnt figure out what the problem was.  So, 2 years ago i had an operation to dilate my urethra, as my urologist thought this may help my problem. Also they had a look inside my bladder and saw no problems. Unfortunately the surgery did not help and i am still suffering. The pain happens mid- urinating and will last up to 20 minutes after i have finished.

Urinary Symptoms and Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/continuing-erratic-symptoms-660115,continuing erratic symptoms ,"I was on this forum earlier this year with LUTS concerns and unfortunately some of the same symptoms have re-surfaced.  So since around November, I started sleeping poorly, waking up anywhere between 2am and 5am and sometimes finding it difficult to go back to sleep.  In December, and only on some occasions, I started having this odd symptom where I would have double voids, in other words I would void around 700ml and then maybe 2 hours later I would feel a slight urge/sensation to void again.  I would then void around the same amount despite not having drunk much in between.  This only happened on occasion and at the time I remember checking my blood sugar (via monitors) and it was normal because I'm worried about diabetes (as it runs in my family). I had a PSA test done and that was normal. Around 4 samples of urinalysis also came back normal too; no signs of infection, no   etc.  But what's interesting is that my feeling of needing to urinate isn't the classic ""busting I really need to go"" feeling, it's more of a tightness, more specifically it's   It does NOT HURT, NO PAIN but just feels slightly tight down there and a sensation that I could pee but don't really need to pee (if you know what I mean?).  Only a few occasions do I remember a slightly burning tingling in the shaft of my penis but that's last like a few seconds. I've googled this and it seems that I'm not alone here with this symptom.  Why does this happen, what could this be?  Is this possibly a prostate infection or something else? The last 4/5 months have been erratic. From mid March til around mid May the symptoms started largely disappearing I would be totally fine for weeks (normal urination patterns. good sleep) and then one day I might have this double/triple void.  It's disturbing to me because on the other days I usually only have to go 3-4 times max and this has always been normal for me.  Every time where I have these voids in relatively short period of time, my urine is usually almost colourless, possibly with a tinge of yellow.  Now I hear this is normal and means you're well hydrated but it bothers me to the point where I start feeling very anxious and on edge probably because I'm worried it's something serious but I guess I'm wondering where the extra urine is coming from?  I have, over the years consumed alot of green tea (obv has caffeine) and other teas but am cutting down now but I don't think this is a cause of any my symptoms.    These last 2 weeks, the insomnia is back and I've been waking up early at like 2am. I'll go to sleep fine then wake up after a few hours and can't get back to sleep until around 6am.  Another key point is that this entire time I've never had any pain really anywhere, soreness, don't feel tired (despite the early morning waking) or thirsty, never been ill, everything else therefore is fairly normal.  The only other thing is very recent, like yesterday I noticed my right testicle is slightly painful when I touch it in one particular area (think I've had this before and it's just gone away by itself) but not sure if this could be related to a prostate infection.    The on and off insomnia and this occasional slightly abnormal urination pattern is what's worrying me.  I don't think the insomnia is related to the  but can't be sure.   0 likes, 1 reply "

But it went away so I forgot about it. Then a few days ago I noticed I was going to the loo a lot more frequently, but only little amounts. Usually I urinate max 4 times a day, but went 4 times within 3 hours of getting up, having had only one cuppa. Now I feel like I need to urinate constantly, even as soon as I stand up from going. Also, I don't know if it's related but in the last few days I've been getting lower back and abdominal pain with nausea after eating and it gets worse at night. Any thoughts?

In my old relationship we used to avoid penetrative sex most of the time or kept it really gentle and short so as not to trigger me. It wasn't an issue and we had a good and creative sex-life. So I am in total shock about being in this flare after a fairly ordinary session albeit quite long. It has been 5 days and I am in more and more pain. I am avoiding seeing new man with lots of excuses but cannot do so indefinitely and will have to say something. I am terrified of scaring him off. Not sure how to handle the situation at all. What exactly should I say or not say? If the flare was short-lived I could just put up with it for a while til I get to know him better but I am zombied out on strong pain meds at the moment. Can anyone give me some words of advice, wisdom or hope please. I keep thinking I'm going to have to spend the rest of my life alone because of this sodding illness and I can't bear it. 0 likes, 4 replies "

What's odd is that I visited many doctors and they told me masturbation does not cause frequent urination, but I am sure it did cause frequent urination to me. The reason I am so sure is that every time I masturbated my condition became worse and every time the urge to urinate took less time to happen. I also heard from several guys on the net that masturbation actually caused the same condition to them. My doctor says it is psychological, I know it's not. I am also not feeling any pain or burns. I heard about keygel exercises, they say it helps. But I am so afraid of trying them because I also heard that if they were practiced the wrong way it would cause damage to me, like doing the exercise without going to the toilet.

The following day this continued throughout the whole day, despite drinking lots of water. I didn't have any other symptoms at that time. The same night, I started to feel a stinging/ burning sensation and this was closely followed by passing red urine. The stinging then subsided, but I continued to pass quite dark urine and I collected a sample. The next day, my urine looked normal and I had no symptoms until later on in the day I had very slight   but again urine looked normal. I took 2 samples in to my GP, one from the night it looked dark and one from the following morning where it looked normal. It came back that there was a large amount of blood in the dark one and a trace in the normal looking one. I then bought urine dipsticks and every time I test it comes back positive for blood and all other parameters normal. My urine has come back from the lab and there was no infection in any samples. I have another appointment with my GP on Friday as she said if there was no infection it needs to be investigated further to see what caused it. She mentioned it could have been a kidney stone, but I would have thought I would have been in pain or had other symptoms. This would also be rare in my age.

However I do still now sometimes get urine infection-like pain especially if I dont drink enough water so I keep myself topped up on water often. What I find really works to get rid of that annoying uncomfortable pain is to COLD blow dry my private area focusing on my uretha opening and/or squirting cold water on it via a sports cap bottle. Also to note for info, before I had a cystoscopy I used to be prescribed antibiotics for many years which starting making me resistant to anti-biotics, so instead after researching I began to use powdered cystitis relief cranberry sachets mixed with water (can be bought from supermarkets - tescos, sainsburys). These sachets were horrible to drink so instead I bought big empty capsules and poured the powder into the capsules to drink with water to avoid tasting the horrible metal tasting drink.

Urinary Tract Infection,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/urethral-issues-possible-uti-692814,"Urethral Issues, possible UTI","I'm a female and on about the 20th of December I made a huge mistake of shaving my pubic area with hair conditioner in the bath tub. I was mentally under a lot of stress, exhausted and restless during this time due to exams (possibly this contributed to weakening my immune system?). The following morning I noticed a  slight discomfort, a burning sensation in my urethra after peeing. I thought this was odd because I have been drinking water continually for past two weeks leading up so I knew I was not dehydrated.  The pain continued after I peed for about two hours, so I continued to drink more water in hopes to flush whatever it was out of my system. That night I woke up to vaginal cramping and watery discharge, that's when I knew something was wrong. After a little research I assumed that I was experiencing a yeast infection due to the discharge and discomfort, so I got over the counter AZO cream that you take once for treatment. However, the following days the burning sensation is my urethra was only getting worse, even though i was strictly drinking cranberry juice and water, so I invested in AZO uti pain relief and cranberry pills instead and took them religiously. The pain was hardly subdued and it felt more like it was leaving my urethra dry and faintly burnt. For about a week the symptoms went away, but they came back full force so I went back to my regimen of cranberry tabs, water and uti relief, even though it was not doing much. The symptoms have been on and off, but this past weekend I noticed that my urine was cloudy with an unusual odor, along with slight abdomen pain, which I researched was a sign of a possible kidney infection. I met with my doctor on Tuesday to get a diagnosis but surprisingly my urine results came back negative. She decided to give a vaginal examine. After a cotton swab she said I had a ""little"" yeast in my vagina so she prescribed me an antibiotic for a yeast infection. Although i felt frustrated, because i have not experienced any vaginal itchiness or burning that would correlate to a yeast infection, I took it anyways with claims that it will give relief within 24 hours. It has been two days and my urine will sometimes come out cloudy still and the pain I get from peeing has returned, and i feel the urge to urinate frequently even though I just went. I doubt it's a uti at this point but I am unsure of what it could be. 0 likes, 2 replies "

My symptoms improved then returned after Christmas so I went back, doctor did another dip test which again was positive so I was given cipro and my urine was sent off to the laboratory. The cipro did nothing to improve symptoms so I treated the UTI myself with D-Mannose. I thought it had cleared up (I felt almost 100% better) but then the symptoms returned so I went back to the doctor. She checked my lab results which showed unlikely infection despite the positive dip tests. She also did another dip test which was negative. The doctor referred me for an ultrasound of my ovaries and uterus, I’m awaiting an appointment. But this morning when I urinated there was bright red blood when I wiped. None in my urine but a small amount the tissue. My symptoms are frequent urination but not a lot coming out, pelvic and back pain. I also have some hip pain along with tiredness. It’s worth mentioning that I had exactly the same thing happen a year ago, three lots of antibiotics didn’t work ended up using d-mannose and I’ve been fine until now.

Eventually I stopped going to the doctor and whenever I got another one id just drink loads of water and take   as needed and it would clear up on its own within a few days. I had an ultrasound of my bladder and kidneys about 5 years ago which was normal at that time. The past few years it seemed to have settled and I hardly ever felt like I had a UTI. But for about 6 months or so now I feel like I might have had one, but just not had the symptoms. The only thing that has brought it to my attention is the smell of my urine (TMI sorry). It has a really strong smell and often smells like fish. I work in a hospital so I do a   regularly and for the last 6 months or so every single time I’ve tested my urine it’s positive for nitrites and leukocytes. Some (but not all) of the time it has +1 protein too. I basically feel like I’ve had a constant UTI for about 6 months, but just haven’t had the pain or any of the other symptoms (except the smell) if that’s possible? I’m just wondering what I should do about it. Since it’s not really bothering me I haven’t been to the doctors as I didn’t really see the point. But I’m wondering if it could be causing damage that I don’t know about if there has been an infection there all that time. Is it ok to just ignore it if it’s not causing me any problems?

Why didn't drug kill it all off? ,"I'm 25 and not sexually active. After having a burning discomfort down there and lower back pains that my doctors were ignoring for weeks to months they finally did a test and discovered I had a UTI. I was put in Macrobid/ nitrofutonin  100mg 1 pill twice a day for 5 days. I took the medicine EXACTLY as prescribed. I was drinking both cranberry juice and water to flush it out completely. I did notice an immediate difference in the pain when I was taking the antibiotics. However, by the 4th day of treatment I noticed My infection stopped responding to the antibiotics. So I just assumed maybe it's residual burning and irritation from having a UTI for awhile. Plus I thought once I finish the course maybe it needed time to kick in so waited a few weeks to see if there would be difference.  So about 3-4 weeks later I decided to go back to the doctor to have my urine retested as the burning would come and go and was still causing me slight discomfort. My results came back today that I still have a UTI. Apparently it's the SAME bacteria from the first time. My lab culture says its ""1,000-9,000 cocci gram positive isolated"". I'm glad he bacteria hasn't grown back to the 10,000-50,000 amount I was seeing on my culture before after so many weeks. Why didn't the antibiotics kill off ALL of the bacteria? What do I do now? I know for a fact it's not a reinfection it's the SAME UTI that didn't fully clear up. I was still experiencing symptoms after i finished the course. Please help!  1 like, 109 replies "

Urticarial Rash,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/chronic-urticaria-suffering-for-13-months-now-560791,Chronic Urticaria- suffering for 13 months now,"In November 2015, I suddenly began feeling itching on my hands, and my feet. I am based in Abu Dhabi, and had just traveled to Lebanon and stayed in a room that was quite dusty. The itching was on and off for a few days and I didn't think much of it. I then traveled to Australia, again staying in a room which was dusty. The itching got worse, and for the first time, red patches with heat and small ""bumps"" in lines started to appear on different parts of my body. I went and saw my GP. I explained my travels, and he diagnosed me with Scabies, and prescribed medication for this. On researching Scabies, I was sure what I had was not scabies, but I completed the treatment. The itching did not stop, and in fact at times became quite intense, but then eased off at random times. I returned to Abu Dhabi, and with the rashes and itching continuing, especially at night, I went to see a dermatologist. He prescribed Telfast 180 antihistamines, which seemed to help control my condition, and asked me monitor my food intake over several days to see if any food item was causing my allergic reaction. Every time I thought I had found the trigger, it seemed to fail with the itching not stopping after days of control and monitoring of foods. The same doctor then suggested that I conduct some allergy tests. I did the first test (blood test) for food items (quite expensive and not covered by insurance, but had to be done as my frustration and itching had become quite intense!). The results came back with everything negative except dairy products. I was somewhat relieved to at least know trigger of my condition, and so I stopped all foods with dairy. Days passed, yet the itching did not stop. At times it actually became worse! The doctor was also confused and suggested I do another allergy test for dust and external factors. The testing place also did a food test again with this dust test. To my amazement and shock, all the results came back negative- including the dairy results, which had come back positive last time. I became more frustrated and the doctor seemed even more confused than before. Meanwhile, my condition continued to progress with severe itching in random and differing parts of my body, the worst place being the soles of my feet and my hands. It was excruciating, and I felt so helpless- at times I would be on the floor like a baby scratching uncontrollably. 4 months had now passed and I went back to the doctor demanding something more. He injected me with a cortisone shot. This actually made my skin break out in a horrible rash on my upper arm which took weeks to heal, but it did slow down the itching for some days. In the meantime I was taking one Telfast a day (at this stage not knowing it was safe for me to take more!!!!). I searched for allergy specialists in the UAE, and finally found one who made monthly visits from overseas. He examined me and after testing my skin for ""staining"" which he called ""dermatographism"", he told me I had an allergic condition known as ""chronic urticaria"", which was the first time I had heard of the name for my condition. He told me to be patient and continue to take antihistamines, but he also recommended I do a prick test. In July I visited Lebanon again and was able to find an experienced immunologist. She was great, and went through my condition in detail explaining that the cause was often never found, and that doing allergy tests was useless in most cases since with chronic urticaria, tests often gave ""false positives"", which explained my dairy findings- a false positive result. It was great hearing detailed information specific to my condition, but quite upsetting when she went through the statistics of the condition- something like 50 % of cases heal within a year, 30% within 5 years, and 20% have it for a life time. Also disturbing was the statistic that in 90% of cases, the cause is never found, while in 10% of cases, the cause can be something internal and often something serious (including cancer!). She told me my treatment would occur in stages. She wanted me to increase my Telfast 180 from 1 tablet to 2, 3 or even 4 tablets per day as long as no symptoms showed. If this dosage did not suppress the condition, she then mentioned other progressive medications, but told me to start with the Telfast for the coming weeks and months in the hope that this settle the mast cells back into a normal state. That was how she explained it. Over the next few weeks, I reached a dosage of 3 Telfasts per day (when I told pharmacists this, they would look at me in disbelief!). By October, I was back down to 2 tablets since for the first time in a long time, I was not feeling any effects of the condition. I was so happy thinking that my body was recovered, or at least almost recovered, and there were days that I actually was living a normal life again and not even thinking about itching or the skins outbreaks. However, it was just 3 weeks ago, that suddenly the rashes, the heat, and the itching returned completely unexpectedly and for no apparent reason since nothing in my life had changed. I was so hopeful that it was just a bad reaction for a day or 2. But with time, it was back with a vengeance- worse than before. I increased my dosage now to 4 tablets, yet the Telfast was now not relieving any of my symptoms- not even 4 tablets a day!!! For the first time I was even feeling tingles and swelling of my lips, and had redness on parts of my body previously not affected. I was completely distressed and went back to my skin doctor since I had no access to my immunologist. He told me that the new outbreak could have been triggered by some antibiotics which I had taken a couple of weeks earlier for a urinary infection. He could see no other reason for the return of the symptoms. However he could not explain why the Telfast was no longer working- I asked for a different antihistamine but he told me it would make no difference and to be patient for a few days to see if my body would settle again. It has now been 10 days, and I can only say that I am suffering badly, especially at night time, when it always seems to be much worse. It became so bad a few days ago that I pleaded with him to give me something else, and he prescribed a cortisone tablet per day- which has actually helped in reducing the itching at most times. But I am told that cortisone tablets are potentially harmful and should only be taken for a short time. He also gave me some lotion which did nothing to help. So here I am, writing in here out of desperation and extreme frustration. I understand that there are people with much worse and with life threatening conditions out there, but I just needed to post this to see what others have done to treat this condition, and whether I should still have hope that my body will actually recover back to the pre-unrticaria stage. Are there any suggestions from anyone who knows about this condition? Please, any advice would be appreciated. The Telfast which was working fine months ago, seems have much less of an effect now. Is it wise to change antihistamine type? Are there better ones, or some specifically better for treating this condition? A friend told me that a friend of his swears by an antihistamine with Levocetirizine 2HCl. Does anyone know if this works well? Sorry for the dramatic detail but I had to release my frustrations in this post in the hope of some good advice from others who have suffered from this or from any medics who might have some information 0 likes, 9 replies "

Urticarial Rash,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/chronic-urticaria-674704,Chronic urticaria,"Hi everyone! I wanted to share my story. I'm a 35 year old male and ive been suffering with urticaria for 3 years. It tends to go into remission in the winter but comes back with a vengeance when the weather warms up.  The first 2 years it was mostly controllable with fexofenadine and occasional prednisolerone (think that's how you spell it), but this year it is out of control to the point it put me in hospital 2 weeks ago with a tight chest, swelling throat, face, hands and feet. I now have to carry around 2 epi pens.  Previously my doctor didn't want to know and had me taking 4x the reccomended dose of fexofenadine saying ""no-one has ever died overdosing on antihistsmines"". Last year I paid for an intolerance test which indicated wheat and dairy along with a few other things. I have since removed them from my diet and my condition improved massively until 2 months ago. I'm now taking 4 piriton a day, 2 ranitidine, 2 fexofenadine and 30mg prednisolerone and it still isn't under control. The doctor is reluctant to give me more of the steroids but at the moment these are the only things that give me somewhat of a normal life. I have been refered for allergy testing but don't hold any hope of them finding anything. 9ne thing I will add is I've been on esomeorazole for acid reflux for 15 years and I do believe these are the cause of my issues. They work by stopping you producing acid but in doing this you do not break down your food properly so you don't absorb vitamins and minerals. Also new research indicates that because you don't break down proteins properly your body's immune system reacts to these proteins and can cause an allergic response. So I am currently trying to wean off these.  Also I read on here about Epsom salts and I'd say they are definitely worth a try. I have just tried them for the first time and I'd say they have reduced my rash and itching by at least 50%!!!.

Urticarial Rash,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/chronic-hives-negative-blood-work-628978,Chronic Hives-negative blood work,"Hey everyone, Hoping to find some help. I started getting hives about 2-3 months ago. Before getting them I got sick. Then I would get 1 on my upper arm about once a week. It would last 3-4 days and fade. The next week another one would pop up. The third one I got ended up blistering so that's when I went to a dermatologist. He did 2 skin biopsies and blood work. Both skin biopsies said it was an allergic reaction. The blood test came back negative for autoimmune diseases and my thyroid was fine. I dis find out I'm allergic to wheat, however, it the number barely makes it allergic. The dermatologist eventually told me there was nothing he could do or tell me and told me to take antihistamines. They seem to have gotten worse. Some weeks I get one and other weeks, like this week, I got 7. They are all on my upper arms. Maybe once or twice I had 1 on my foot and 1 on my belly. The only thing high on my blood test was my C Reative Protein. The allergist I seen said she couldn't do anything because the dermatologist did all the blood work and the allergic reaction to wheat is so small she doesn't think it would cause hives. I can't figure it out. An no one else can either.....its frustrating to say the least.  0 likes, 21 replies "
Uterine Fibroids,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/post-myomectomy-the-never-ending-menstrual-cycle-693503,Post Myomectomy: The Never-Ending Menstrual Cycle,"I had an open myomectomy on December 11, 2018, to have at least 23   removed.  I bled/spotted a teeny bit for a few days after the procedure.  Then a month passed. I got my period.  Four days. Light to moderate bleeding.  No biggie. SO much better than what I used to experience! Fast-forward to two weeks later (approximately six weeks after my surgery).  I got my period again and this time, HOLY CRAP--it was awful.  Horrible gushing and clots--even worse than how my cycle used to be prior to the operation.  I leaked through my pad several times. Went to the doctor and started on birth control again.  The birth control at least calmed the flow down from Niagra Falls level.  Except I haven't stopped bleeding. I've now been bleeding for three weeks straight. I had a glimmer of hope yesterday that it might FINALLY stop, since I was just spotting. Then, BOOM.  I was up at 1:30 in the morning because I'd leaked through my pad onto my bedding. Aside from this being super frustrating, I'm terrified of becoming anemic again.  (I needed four iron infusions prior to the surgery and a blood transfusion after the surgery.) I'm taking  iron, but am worried nonetheless.  Plus, my skin is irritated as hell from having to constantly wear pads (I can't do tampons). My OBGYN says it's not unusual that this is happening, since my surgery was so major.  I was told that this could continue for two to three months before my uterine lining becomes thinner and my cycle calms down and evens out and that for at least two months, I need to skip the placebo week of the birth control pill and to go directly to the next pack. I was also told that unless I'm soaking through more than one pad per hour (which I'm not), then the situation isn't urgent. I was advised to keep taking the iron supplement and if I start to feel anemic, to go to the ER or follow up with the hematologist I'd gone to for my iron infusions. I'm so frustrated and I wish somebody had told me beforehand to potentially expect this.  Moreover, when I was panicking (before I got a chance to talk to my doctor) and began looking things up online, not ONE medical website or forum listed this as an after-effect of a myomectomy.  On the contrary, said websites stated that periods should get better and lighter after such a procedure. Has anyone else experienced this? 0 likes, 2 replies "

It hurts when i take  a deep breath because my uterus is pushed up under my rib cage.  I'm in so much pain. I found out 6 days before the hysterectomy that i was too high risk for the surgery. I wanted to die. I've been looking forward to this surgery since November 30th 2018. I was making plans for  new life that was going to start on 2/11/19 (hysterectomy day) My fibroid sits on my cervix and I'm in so much pain and discomfort.

Ibuprofen or Tylenol do not work for my pain. I've tried oxycodone and it doesn't alleviate any of this pain. I tried very expensive CBD oil i got from my wonderful doctor and it takes maybe 10% of the discomfort away. I do heat and lots of rest with feet up.

I had chronic idiopathic urticaria for a year.  It started out with some itchy palms that would wake me at night.  Then it spread to other parts of my body.  There were days I had hundreds, maybe thousands.  They only thing that would alleviate them was Prednisone but I was determined not to take that for more than a week.   I had every blood test in the book.  Nothing stopped the itch.  I tried anything you can imagine from CBD oil to numbing cream for tattoos.   I saw an allergist, two dermatologists, a GP, a cardiologist, an R/A, you name it.  Nobody had a clue.  They all said it could not be cured - it had to go away on its own.  I started keeping a detailed diary.  I recommend you do that.  I noticed it flared more when I would eat more carbs or have a few drinks.  I was virtually hopeless.  I started fasting to see how my body would react.  I noticed that with no alcohol and less carbs the hives would reduce but not eradicate.  I couldn't take it anymore.  I could not imagine living like this another 40 years.  Then by happenstance during a routine checkup I mentioned to my doctor that they seemed to flare the more I ate and the more I drank.  I light went on and he said the common denominator in alcohol and most foods is yeast.  He said no physicians would agree with him, that it was a long shot but maybe I had Candida.  I had not heard of Candida.  I started reading up on it and saw the connection between yeast and leaky gut - the permeability of your GI track that allows microscopic toxic secretions to leak into your body and trigger an immune response.  Hmmmm.   I'm not overweight.  I'm in fairly great shape.  How could I have leaky gut.  He put me on a two week prescription of Fluconazole (anti-fungal) and I adjusted my diet to no/low yeast - basically gluten free.  I cut back on the alcohol substantially and limited my intake to vodka which contains no yeast after distilling.  Within days my hives started to reduce in size, color and itch.  I literally watched them reduce down to a handful, then one or two.  I was then seeing one at night, none during the day.  I was basically hive free for the first time in a year.  I considered it nothing short of a miracle and believe-you-me i was praying every day for the wisdom to discover the problem.  I was a healthy, in shape male.  I would never have suspected myself as having a yeast or leaky gut syndrome.  I had no symptoms - except hives.  Watching them dry up to nothing is probably one of the most exciting moments of my life.  If you are reading this and you are desperate, don't give up.  You are what you eat.  Don't ever forget that.  Don't let any doctor tell you you're wrong - consider leaky gut syndrome and consider trying a two week prescription of Fluconazole and a good pro-biotic.

I think he could have been cured in a month if we had followed the Chinese doctor’s diet advice more closely. Now he eats whatever he wants with no problems, knock on wood. He has been medication and rash free only 12 days so far. I’ll let you guys know if it changes.  Conventional doctor prescribed him zyrtec. Google search on its safety reveals a lawsuit that says Zyrtec’s withdrawal symptoms are terrible rashes. If my nephew had stayed on Zyrtec, he would probably be fine for a few years and then Zyrtec would fail him and he would have to start taking prednisone. Reading some of the stories on here made me really glad I took him to a Chinese doctor. FYI  If anyone is going to try Chinese medicine, try not to take other medicine at the same time. Some of them can interfere with Chinese medicine. I read that one doctor has verified that Zyrtec does. Good luck. 0 likes, 13 replies "
