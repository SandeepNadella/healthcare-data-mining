But I was only 49 years old and knew nothing about Prostate Cancer and immediately thought I was going to die within a year!!!¬† So I was advised to have either Brachytherapy or have it removed despite the very serious side-effects that would result. So I did some research and having done so it immediately became quite clear that many, many men opt for these procedures when they could and should have remained on Active Surveillance. It still makes me angry now thinking about the appointments I had with Doctors saying that the Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting advised to have the condition treated.¬†It really is nothing short of a scandal how many have treatment when they either don't need it or don't need it yet. There are numerous studies out there to show that the risk of dying from Prostate Cancer ‚Äì especially someone my age are just the same whether you have radical treatment or not. Obviously this isn‚Äôt the same for everyone and people have different circumstances. As a mental health nurse I can quite easily cognitively deal with the fact I have cancer,¬† but of course this isn‚Äôt the case for some who just ‚Äúwant it out‚Äù. My PSA last month was 2.2 and hasn‚Äôt been above 3 for over 3 years. So if you‚Äôre in a position that is similar to mine ‚Äì don‚Äôt rush into it ‚Äì there must be so many men out there who have had radical surgery who really didn‚Äôt need to, and I can‚Äôt imagine how some of them feel. Yes there must be many instances when this does need to happen, but bear in mind there‚Äôs many instances that it doesn‚Äôt. Best of luck everyone Mark 3 likes, 7 replies "

I'm fortunate that I live fairly close (about 2 hours away) from Dr. Sandeep Bagla, one of the top IR guys in the country for this procedure (if not THE top guy). ¬†I can tell you first hand that Dr. Bagla is a first class doctor and all around nice guy as well. ¬†Very professional, courteous, answers all your questions, and just gives off that vibe like you know everything's going to be fine if this guy does my procedure. ¬†After driving down to meet him in person and do the initial consult at his office, I left there thinking - YES, this is the procedure that I'm going to have. My urologist in Winchester, VA is actually a very good guy (doesn't do any in-hospital procedures himself, only does in-office procedures) and when I asked him about the PAE, he knew about them and had read about the procedure, and thought I'd be an excellent candidate. ¬†He encouraged me to go foward with it. There was some difficulty getting my insurer to pay (they initially denied the pre-authorization) so Dr. Bagla had to do some follow ups with the insurance company doctors in order to get them to pay for the procedure. ¬† Dr. Bagla and his team at Vascular Institute of Virginia is just top notch. ¬†There's no other way to describe them. ¬†Very friendly, easy to work with, and very professional. ¬†There wasn't one minute that I didn't feel like I was in good hands. ¬†My procedure was in mid-January, I got there at 7:30am, they started my IV of solu-mederol since I'm allergic to IV contrast, and within about 45 minutes I was on the table in the surgery suite. ¬†The sedation they use is excellent - fentanyl and versed I believe. ¬†Enough that I was aware of what was going on (I remember thinking geez are they done yet...? during the procedure), yet I was still off in a cozy, dreamy happy land. ¬†Weird but cool. ¬† The proedure was a success, took about 90 minutes. ¬†Laying flat on my back for 2+ hours afterwards was miserable. ¬†By far that was the hardest part of the entire procedure. ¬†Killed my back having to lay flat on a very hard mattress, if I ever had it done again I'd bring a nice memory foam topper to have them use, lol. ¬† Anyway, I was out of the office by about 1:15pm and on the way home. ¬†I passed a little blood in my urine while there at the office. ¬†Nothing uncomfortable, no burning or anything like that. ¬†I can't take nsaids so I didn't take any prednisone following the procedure, no ibuprofen or anything like that. ¬†I took one Celebrex in the morning and one in the evening for several days afterwards. ¬†This was by far one of the easiest medical procedures I've ever had done. ¬†No problems at all. ¬†Again the only discomfort I had was laying flat on my back for two hours after the procedure. ¬†Other than that it was a piece of cake. It's been nearly two weeks and I've had steady improvement. ¬†Not a night & day difference - but definite improvement. ¬†I'm not peeing like a racehorse yet, but defintely peeing better. ¬†No dripping afterwards. ¬†Getting up less at night, so my sleeping is better. ¬†You don't realilze how much your sleep is affected because it happens so gradually over the years - but wow, sleeping for 2-3 hours at a time rather than getting up every hour or so is so much more restful. ¬†I still get up about 3 times per night...but that's much improved from 4-5 times per night. ¬†And it's only been two weeks so I'll still get more improvement. I can say that without a doubt, I highly recommend Dr. Bagla and his staff. ¬†And I highly recommend the PAE procedure. ¬†If you are having doubts....I'd say just go ahead and do it. ¬†It was so much easier that I had imagined. ¬†Very happy that I had it done. 3 likes, 168 replies "

I've posted this question because here in the UK doctors were always advised to hand out courses of 4 - 6 weeks of either drug  without having to confirm there was any infection in the first place.  In the last couple of weeks (Feb 2019) the official advice for   has just been changed to prescribing, IF an infection is confirmed, Trimethoprim (Bactrim) or Azithromycin . This is a huge turn around which has come about because the European Medicines Agency have ruled that the fluoroquinolones are too dangerous to be used as 'just in case' drugs. Unfortunately they are still advised for   but the dose has been reduced to just 2 weeks (down from 4-6 weeks)  - and the doctor is still told to check for actual infection first. I know that some of you have said that you have had some problems from taking a fluoroquinolone while others have said it cleared up their pain.  I'd like to get some kind of figures about whether you've been prescribed a fluoroquinolone in the past (for any problem, not just pelvic issues) and if you noticed any adverse reactions afterwards. There are 5 fluoroquinolones generally available in Europe and the US - Cipro, Ofloxacin, Levofloxacin (Levaquin), Moxifloxacin (Avelox) and Norfloxacin.  There are many other names in use in many other countries (eg. Tavanic for Levofloxacin) which I know is confusing!  Please do let me know what your experience of these drugs has been.

Prostate Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/tamsulosin-flomax--697718,Tamsulosin (Flomax),"I was diagnosed with BPH. My urologist prescribed me Tamsulosin. The first three nights were horrible. My pee was from weak stream to dripping. Then it was gradually back to the stage before taking the med. Then I had severe allergy, running nose all the time for a week. I thought it was normal allergy (although I hardly experienced any allergy in my life). It's gone in a couple of weeks. Then I noticed my retrograde ejaculation and severe ED. I am 56 yo healthy and exercise daily. My ED gets worse that even taking 100 mg of Viagra still could not retain my erection. So I stopped a couple of weeks ago and discussed with the doc about it. He said that its the indication that the drug works. But my urination has not been improved but actually gotten worse. Since I stopped (two weeks already), I am still experiencing retrograde ejaculation, actually it's worse than ever to the point of nothing really comes out. I cannot maintain my erection. It's so bad. I am not sure if anyone has experienced this. Will the condition goes away? I am hoping that stopping the pills, the condition will reverse back to normal.

Prostate Cancer,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/long-time-ago-686038,Long time ago,"At the age of 60 in 1996 I had a cystoscopy (internal examination) as my urine flow was very weak and I was out of bed 6 or 7 times during the night. The urologist said ""Your prostate would win a highly commended in a produce show"" so  he recommended a TURP  to ease urine flow. The biopsy on the tissue removed showed traces of cancer. I went for a further needle biopsy which showed that it was well spread. My PSA count was only 6.5. I was offered the choice of Surgery, Radio Therapy or wait and see.  Then the surgery was very serious as the latest robotic / micro surgery had not been invented.  If I had surgery I could still have RT after if necessary. If I took the 'wait and see' route I was told that I would only have about 2 years. So I went for the surgery. It was quite intrusive but I got over it and for six years was fine albeit that it put a big dent in my sex life. I went for PSA tests every 6 months and after six years it started to rise again. I was then sent for Radio Therapy treatment. A total of 37 daily visits. It wasn't that bad but made me very tired.  I am now 81 and falling apart with all sorts of age related ailments.  But it has been 22 years since the PC and I have had no further problem with it. I had a stage 2 melanoma on my arm which was successfully removed and I have regular check ups as it would seem I have the cancer gene.  It is worrying at the time to be told that one has cancer but keeping a positive mental attitude helps. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Post Open RP I was staggered to discover a possible link between my 12 months of Dutasteride treatment in 2013/14 and serious PCa. My subsequent enquiries were unable to confirm definite involvement but I still regret this treatment that was at best unneeded and without BPH benefit. The gland failed to achieve it's suggested 20% size reduction. My research led to suggestions PMR may be linked to PCa or its surgery. The cause of PMR is unknown but there may be some link to some cases. Does any post-RP or post RARP survivors here have subsequent PMR issues? PMR and its treatment involves the immune system which is our natural cancer combatant. PMR treatment involves suppression of the immune responses which may not be in our best interests since we are told we have to assume we still have PCa cells in our bodies waiting to declare themselves.

I didn't fine the procedure painful, just uncomfortable. He used two tubes on local don into my urethra and used a flexible scope. It did not hurt to urinate, and there was no blood after. What really bothered me was the fact that for the next 2 hours after the scope, the tip of my penis and urethra were swollen. It looked abnormal. best was to describe it was that my urethra looked like it had botox, and it looked very puffy. I found it hard to pee afterwards but it's something about the gel they use that seems to make it very hard for me to pee after I have anything done. During my urodymics test, She used one tube of local. I felt no pain as it was inserted until she hit something that made me flinch. Later that day I had some mild burning when I urinated and then I saw a small drop of blood in my urine, but that was it - day 2 was fine. My concern is that I now have a stricture caused from the swelling of my urethra. I have read that a scope can indeed cause a stricture. 3 months after the scope I had to start sitting down to urinate. I also now have hesitancy, but I don't know how much of that is psychological as if I think about it it becomes worse, and sometimes I don't have it at all. One thing that bothers me is that fact that I sometimes have A LOT of urine left over in my urethra along with ejaculation.  There seems to be 1-2 drops left over in my penile urethra after I void, or something it can be completely full. I have to milk it out which is annoying. There also seems to be some left over in the bulbar urethra. Did any of you have a swollen urethra after your scope? Some men say they didn't but did have blood and burning for days and weeks, and a few have said they had a puffy urethra for a few days. Do you think it's likely that I have developed a stricture near the tip of my penis? Did the urodynamics test possibly cause one in the bulbar? My flow is strange. It's up and down. Sometimes it comes out fast, other times average, and then it dribbles. I'm 33 and don't have BPH but have been diagnosed with ""chronic non-bacterial prostititis"".

I spent one night in the hospital and came home without a catheter.  Voiding was unpleasant for the first couple of days but after that it was fine, other than the expected urgency and frequency.  I resumed all normal activities after 3 weeks per my urologist's instructions.  He said it would take 3 months to heal completely but I have seen no blood or scabs in my pee for about 2 weeks and am feeling fine. The positive outcomes have been:  1) much stronger stream, 2) voiding twice the volume I did before the procedure, 3)  often getting up only once per night, (before I almost always got up twice and occasionally 3 times), 4) can hold it, if necessary, when I feel the urge, 5) alcohol no longer affects my voiding, 6) no longer have the feeling that I haven't emptied my bladder, 6) pathology discovered   which a previous prostate   had missed (it's the least aggressive kind so I'm in the ""aggressive surveillance"" mode.) The only negative is retrograde ejaculation.  This doesn't bother me (or my wife) and I had it already due to BPH medication (doxazosin, which I discontinued immediately following surgery) but I put it down because it could be an issue for some.  It is common and often unavoidable after a TURP. There is really no reason for a man to suffer from BPH in the 21st century.  If medication doesn't work to your satisfaction, do your research (and by research I mean reading the results of clinical trials which are widely available on the internet).  Discuss your situation with your doctor (urologist), then pick the procedure you (and your doctor) feel is best for you.

My retention issues were becoming intolerable and I was spending hours in the bathroom every night trying to pee - absolutely ruining my sleep. Tried to self cath a couple of weeks ago but pain was extreme so that was not an option for me. Some here do CIC and say good things about it, but we're all different. Pre-Op: Was advised to go off all vitamins and supplements for the week prior. Got a call from pre-op nurse and she went over my medical history and meds. Went into the Kaiser Surgery Clinic and received a package of: ClearFast Nutrition Drink and Chlorhexidine Gluconate body wipe cloths. Last evening did not have anything other than water after dinner. At 10pm, per instructions, showered and shampooed my hair. At 11pm wiped my body with the antibiotic cloths. Wife did my back. No  , and the Chlorhexidine smelled fresh. My scheduled arrival time at hospital was 6:05am, so 2 hours before, again as instructed, drank the ClearFast (18oz). Pleasant tasting, like diluted sport drink. Mostly dextrose. Checked in at 6:05am, went to prep area about 6:30. Tried to pee twice with minor success, then changed into surgical gown. All clothes put in a bag. Wallet checked into their safe. They recommended this. Spoke with a couple of additional nurses, and two anesthesiologists. Decided on general rather than spinal, which I have had before. My uro came by briefly. By about 7:30 wheeled into operating room. Some chat with nurses, then woke up, and wondered when we would begin - was told it was over! I had a Foley draining into a night bag, bladder felt somewhat full and a bit irritated. They were doing the saline draining procedure. Uro came by and said the urine color looked good, and there wasn't a lot of bleeding during the operation. They called my wife, who came to pick me up. She and a nurse helped me to stand up, and the bladder irritation subsided. I actually went home in my hospital gown with a shirt on top - didn't want to attempt to put on my pants or shoes. They give you little hospital socks. Home by about 10:30m, sooner than expected. Before leaving the hospital the nurse switched my drain bag to a leg bag and we secured it with tape, straps. At home I padded my underpants and applied Neosporin to increase lubrication and kill bacteria. Absolutely no prostate pain. Where the Foley inserts into the tip of the penis there is irritation. I have experienced this five years ago when I had Foleys in and out for five weeks after radiation for  , so I am ""sort of"" used to the irritation. It gets better. Took a Tylenol and that helped. Now been home for 4 hours and urine stream is still pink, but appears to be clearing. Continue to drink water. I empty the bag into my urine measuring beaker, and an hour ago emptied 400ml - that's 1 hour! So, the hospital pumped water into me, and I have been drinking at home, not concerned about retention because of the Foley, They did give me an antibiotic at the hospital - don't know which one but not Cipro. Also, I believe they gave me something to constipate me, because I am unable to make that happen. Normally, I go in the morning, so I feel a bit blocked up. There is some blood coming from the penis tip where the catheter inserts, but not much in the urine stream, so that is doing well. That nagging urge to pee is, at least for now, gone away, as my bladder is continuously empty. I was told to keep the Foley in for 3 days. I know how to remove my own, and will do so on Monday morning, then we will see how I am doing. I was told that if the Foley drain tube gets blocked by a clot I could manually rub the clot and it should then pass. In a worst case scenario there is always the ER, but so far , so good with the Foley.  More later.... 1 like, 33 replies "

The first time I did it was in a Urologist's office.  The Urologist himself taught me how to do it.  Unfortunately he skipped the hand washing step and I was using a red rubber catheter which requires pushing the catheter in with your fingers.  I developed a UTI within a day or two.   While on a 10 day course of the antibiotic, Cipro.   I went in for a PSA test.  The PSA came back at 26 where six months earlier it had been 2.4 before using catheters.    The high PSA is to be expected with a UTI.   I had another PSA test 4 months later that came in at 6.2 so it had come down but was still high.  Another PSA test 6 months after that was 5.3,  so lower again,  but still high.  The whole time I continued using the catheters.

Prior to the operation I was getting up at night every hour and spent about 10-20 min in the bathroom each time trying to clear my bladder, so that I could get back to sleep. Last night, I was able to sleep a solid 5 hours, before waking up! That is the longest I have slept in one stretch for years. My leg bag was almost full and I measured the amount of urine by draining the bag into a measuring beaker - about 750cc at 5am this morning. This was the most sleep at one stretch I have had in years, and the most I have every emptied into my beaker. After I finally woke up this morning I tested my urine with a Chemstrip test strip, as I have been doing regularly in recent days, and the Leukocytes are up and indicating an infection. I can't say this was unexpected. I am also feeling a bit ""spaced out"" this morning. This is possibly because I haven't slept a straight five hours in years. My head is clearing a bit now and I am able to post here. I am now two days and a few hours out from my Bipolar TURP. Here's what I am currently experiencing: I have been adding more olive oil to my two daily blender drinks and this has cured my   (a common side effect of surgery, right?) Tomorrow (Monday) I will deflate the Foley catheter myself, remove it (have done this before) then I have an appointment with my urologist at 2pm. I have a note in to him to have a lab urine test to find out if I do have an infection as my test strips indicate. I might need an antibiotic. Once I remove the catheter I am hoping I can urinate on my own. Otherwise, a nurse will have to reinsert a new one - not looking forward to that - can be quite painful. Best possible outcome tomorrow would be that I will remove the Foley and be able to urinate on my own, the urine test strips show the Leukocytes going down, and hemoglobin in urine going down. Don't know what will happen. Recovering from any operation/procedure is always a challenge. 0 likes, 5 replies "

I remember the horrendous side effects when withdrawing from Ativan and then Seroxat, and was assured by my then Doctor that Propranolol was easier to stop. I managed to get off Citalopram just before Christmas 2017, with a lot of   side effects, but stayed on 1x40mg of Propranolol , then taking another 40mg at night, to help me sleep (it didn't! It had the opposite effect - insomnia, nightmares, sweating etc). The extra tablet also seemed to lower my blood pressure ( I am taking Losartan)  to an unheard of - for me, anyway - reading. I also felt a bit dizzy.  So I have decided to rid myself of Propranolol and have been taking, since Sunday, 20mg one day then 40mg the next.

I think the problem in the US is that it is so extremely lucrative that urologists can't pass it up.  Ken had a good outcome probably because his condition was a good fit for it.  A larger uncomplicated prostate with no middle lobe or bladder neck issues.  Mine was a smaller more ""funky"" shape.  My doctor does 10 a day, a couple times a month.  At 15K a pop that's 150K a day or about $1000.00 a minute, for the procedure.   If you are over 40 and have difficulty urinating the default diagnosis with no testing is BPH and the default solution is a 15k urolift office procedure.  If it doesn't work, then maybe a 15-20k follow-up Turp procedure.     There is no incentive to do urodynamic testing to determine if the problem might be bladder related.   I wish I had read more of the ""not so good"" reviews before having the procedure.   Now I am worried that I have 6 implants that might break loose down the road and cause issues when the result didn't really improve my condition and was painful and expensive.     My suggestion to anyone considering it would be to get a second opinion from another doctor that has no financial incentive 0 likes, 25 replies "

Overnight had a few little tickles in my bladder - likely minor spasms. Briefly irritating, went away. I will remove my Foley catheter this morning and have a 2pm appointment at the urology office. If I am unable to void they will have to put in another Foley -painful, but necessary. The Foley that I have in now is a 20fr with double eyelets - necessary to drain the little pieces of prostate that are still washing out with my urine - noticed some in my leg bag last night. When they do a TURP they send the prostate tissue to the lab for analysis to see if there is any  . My report just came in negative. So, the radiation treatment I had in 2014 worked!! PSA has been 0.1 to 0.2 steady for about 4-5 years.  issue solved by drinking more olive oil. With Foley, can't sit down on the toilet seat - when I tried this previously was very painful and caused bleeding, but able to stand, and olive oil provides lubrication. If you get constipated, this works!! About self removing Foley - two ways to do this. First way is to use a little syringe and draw the saline solution out of the little balloon that is keeping the Foley in the bladder. An easier way is to get in the shower and cut the little tube rather than sucking the saline out with the syringe. Then, when the solution has drained, gently ease the Foley out and run warm water over the abdomen - did this before and the removal doesn't hurt, only tickles. Finally, my urine dip stick was showing leukocytes present but note from urologist said this is because of the inflammation from the operation and would continue for weeks or month, so not an issue. Was concerned about a UTI. Apparently, all is still OK. 0 likes, 7 replies "
Prostate Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-bipolar-turp-experience-24hrs-post-op-698655,My Bipolar TURP Experience 24hrs Post Op,"I am now about 1 day post op. After my post yesterday, I went into the evening and experienced the following: Still some blood in urine but improving color. Still soreness and some bleeding at Foley insertion but improving. Constipation. I have been drinking a lot of fluids and I assume they gave me fluids at the hospital, but I have been urinating a lot into my leg bag. The color does seem to be improving, so less blood. Overnight I measured 1265ml total from just before midnight to about 9am this morning. Normally, my total would be about 800ml, so a lot of fluid is passing through, and this is a good thing. Have to keep flushing the system. I have learned how to pad and protect the Foley catheter insertion point with tissues, paper towels and other padding. This keeps the tube from wiggling around and causing pain and bleeding. I also keep the tube lubricated with Neosporin, but added standard lubricating and antibacterial jelly - the type used to self cath. The drain tube is well braced to my leg. The idea is to keep the Foley tube from pulling or tugging. Really helps. The irritation point into the penis feels a lot better this morning - less pain, less blood. The constipation issue took me by surprise. Last evening I felt the need to go. I usually go in the morning but there had been no bowel movement all day and I could feel that I was backing up. I tried to sit on the toilet seat, but this was painful to the Foley insertion point and I stared bleeding. So, I got up and realized I would not be able to complete the job sitting down. I had some Fleet glycerin suppositories and used them. I was eventually able to get some relief. After doing research I found that one side effect of general anesthesia can be constipation. This was not anticipated by me. Still having an issue this morning. Sleep: I was concerned that with the irritation I was feeling from the Foley and in my bladder (thought it went away yesterday, but the irritation came back), I wouldn't be able to sleep. However, I was able to get some sleep last night. I woke up five times to empty the leg bag, and using a combination of prayer and affirmations I was able to get back to sleep. Prior to the operation I wasn't able to sleep until I emptied my bladder, as the irritation would keep me awake and kept waking me up. But last night surprised me. My bladder was empty, but the irritation of the Foley and post-op irritation was there. Anyway, made it through the night OK. A big relief. This morning I tested my urine with a test strip, and noticed I am now getting leukocytes showing up in purple on the strip. This usually indicates the presence of a UTI. I was expecting this. But, it's Saturday and my uro and regular doctor are off for the weekend, so I will be going to the lab and attempt to get an analysis done without one being officially ordered first by a doctor. Maybe they will do it, and maybe they won't. If and when I get the urine test my uro will have to order an antibiotic for me, and not Cipro. Looks like that may be a few days away.  And if I do have a UTI, how did I get it? I have been keeping the Foley insertion point as sterile as possible, washing my hands, using alcohol gel, etc. Who knows? Got a UTI last year after my one and only cystoscope. Again, who knows? Apparently, it doesn't take much to get an infection started. The blood coming from the tip of my penis because of the Foley tube is less this morning and I am getting used to the Foley. Five years ago I had six Foley's in and out for five weeks and found that it took a couple of days for the penis linings to get used to the tube, so all is going as expected. The Foley experience would be the same for any procedure, except for PAE. No UTI last time, but this time may be different. My uro wants me to remove the Foley Monday morning to see if I can void on my own. Then, I have an afternoon appointment with him. If I can't void, his nurse will have to put in another Foley. It's a bit painful, but I can deal with it if I take Tylenol before. Hopefully, I can void on Monday. Despite the fact that prostate tissue is removed by the TURP, there is still prostate swelling and inflammation of the urethral tissues, so a voiding test is necessary. The normal time for a post op Foley to be kept in is three days, so, my procedure was on Friday morning, and three days later, the Foley comes out on Monday morning. I have a little syringe that I have used before to suck the saline solution out of the little balloon in my bladder that keeps the Foley in place. I do this in a warm shower. Just insert the syringe into the appropriate port on the leg bag and drain the saline, and the Foley just pops out - tickles a bit if done slowly. Warm water in the shower makes it even easier. If a nurse does it, she just yanks it out, and this can be painful. So, bottom line, doing much better today but still concerned about the constipation and possible UTI, and if I do develop a UTI how will this effect my sleep. Will keep hydrating and continue to keep the Foley tube padded and taped down and lubricated with antibiotic gel. Will post here again tomorrow. Tom 0 likes, 14 replies "

I now feel totally vindicated in going to the GP for help. I am 60 and was always a ‚Äúnervy‚Äù child until I left school, got a job and found a new self confidence and joie de vivre. ¬†Anxiety didn‚Äôt start to rear its ugly head until a year ago, despite several bumps in the road of my lifes journey before then, and then it was relatively mild and only travel or dentist related, so not that often. Would just wake up really early in the morning and get anxious but as soon as I was on my way, I‚Äôd relax. ¬†Then in April this year - bang ! I would wake up suddenly in the night, heart racing and pounding, sweating, knotted stomach and it took a huge amount of deep breathing to bring it under control. ¬†Being a lady of a certain age, nocturnal visits are common and whenever I woke up and had to go to the loo, bang again. Heart thumping and racing, stomach churning, tense, knotted feeling in my abdomen.

I suppose as soon as I am awake, my brain just takes control.The anxiety then started to impact on my daily life. I could be on the computer working, hoovering the carpet, doing ironing - all typical and mundane routines and - bang ! ¬†My decision to go to the GP was made after I had a panic attack over going to spend the day with a friend of mine who I‚Äôve known for 45 years. ¬†Another attack over going out to dinner with my daughters parents in law, and a really bad attack today over meeting my cousin and friend for lunch tomorrow (obviously known her all my life) and spending the weekend with friends this weekend (known them for over 15 years and stayed with them several times). Initially my GP prescribed me Fluoxetine but told me it could take up to a month to take effect. ¬†Today‚Äôs anxiety attack (in my home) was particularly bad and I thought, nope there‚Äôs no way I can cope with this for another month, so went back and saw a different GP. I explained what is going on with my life, how this anxiety is making me feel and that I can‚Äôt cope with these awful feelings for another month and needed something that would kick in straight away. She prescribed Propanalol. ¬†I am also going to make arrangements to do one to one CBT, as I found talking to the GP really helped for the 10 minutes I was in her room. She said my serotonin levels are probably on the floor and has suggested I take 4 x 10mg daily, but I can adjust the quantity to suit. ¬† I am going to take a tablet now, and then another when I go up to bed as I want to experience the effect they have on me, before I go into the full dosage in the morning. I am hoping that, after tomorrow morning‚Äôs dose, I will get to my lunch and thoroughly enjoy it, likewise our weekend away. Having read everyone‚Äôs positive experience that Propanalol has had on their anxiety, I am confident that tomorrow I can take back control and start to look forward to future events with excitement and not trepidation. ¬†I will post an update in a few days. 0 likes, 3 replies "

I felt that my body was literally going to shut down. Take tablets About 5 hours apart so that the last one is taken just before I go to bed. ¬† Unfortunately a social lunch on the Friday and a social weekend away had to be cancelled as I couldn‚Äôt get to them due to the anxiety - I‚Äôd only had 2 tablets by the Thursday night so I guess they weren‚Äôt enough to change anything. ¬†Things did change dramatically about three days later. I just suddenly felt lighter, more calm and was sleeping so much better. I wasn‚Äôt waking up in a sheer panic with heart racing at 2am and if I did wake up to go to the loo, I went back to sleep. No horrible intrusive thoughts or worrying about anything. I have had several instances happen this week which would have ordinarily sent me into an anxiety attack and a complete mess, but which had no effect on me. I have been out for walks, driven to the shops etc and been fine. ¬†I have an appointment this Saturday with a Consultant on an unrelated matter and it will be interesting to see how I am on the day as this is my first booked appointment since taking the tablets. ¬†I noticed it was booked events that I would spend sometimes weeks irrationally worrying about. ¬†As for side effects, I do get a tight head now and then but nothing else. I have been advised to go for CBT, which now I feel that i‚Äôve got a bit of my mojo back, I will arrange. I don‚Äôt want to rely on tablets forever but at the moment they are helping me feel better than I have for the last few years. ¬†The GP has left it to me to control the dosage, so I may try to reduce down after Saturday and see how I get on. ¬† I do find that when I wake up in the morning (around 6am) I am not 100% calm and relaxed but am nowhere near as tense and panicky as I was before.

I've been on Propranolol 80mg slow release for about 5 months for severe anxiety, and today, after talking to my doctor last week about wanting to come off and start with maybe going on a lower dose, and then asking 2 pharmacists about it, I started today on 10mg Propranolol (Inderal) taking 4 a day, basically halving my dose of the slow release. My doctor actually gave me the 10mg to take on top of the one I was taking, but also said I could just take them 4x a day and get them on repeat if I wanted to. Throughout the day, I've had ups and downs, sometimes feeling a bit tight chested, usually an hour after taking it, or little flutter in my chest. I took my 3rd an hour ago, but I got a really bad chest pain, it only lasted a few seconds. But I'm starting to panic and get really scared I'm going to have a heart attack or stroke or something, or something really bad is going to happen. I'm 31 year old female, don't drink or smoke, had about 4 ECG's this year and a heart and blood pressure monitor, all were normal, these were around the same time I started the Propranolol 5 months ago.  I've also nearly been to the doctor every week because of my anxiety, and they've checked my heart each time. All normal. Last week my doctor listened to my heart, took my oxygen level and blood pressure, all was fine he said. So, I'm fightened right now that the lower doses I started today are causing my heart damage or going to give me a heart attack?

My blood pressure and heart rate had always been normal - around 110/70 with a HR of 70. I started on 10mg a day and worked my way up to 40mg over the space of 2 weeks (I was on 35mg for 3 days and only got to 40mg for a day), but felt depressed and really tired, experienced trouble sleeping and occasionally had chest pains. Since it did nothing for my headaches, I told my doctor, who told me to stop taking it. So over the course of a week I reduced it from 35mg back down and took my final dose on the 22nd of January. Since stopping, I have had a lot of chest pain, dizziness, trouble breathing and a pounding heart any time I stand up or engage in strenuous activity. It's better than it was last week, but my heart pounding any time I move really worries me. I've had ECGs and bloodwork done and the results have always been normal. I read a few posts on here with many people saying they have had palpitations or difficulty doing simple things immediately after coming off, but wondered if it got better for you over time? I hadn't been on it long, and the dose wasn't very high, but I guess I just need some reassurance that this will go away as it's causing me a lot of distress. My heart even seems to race when I change positions in bed, so it really is worrying. I plan to go back to my doctor soon about all of this, but would really feel better hearing from your experiences too, as doctor's have a tendency to brush off this sort of thing.

Not sure if these symptoms are related but my Doctor takes forever in calling me back or sometimes removes me from her call back list and I don't want to bother her because she's probably so busy.

The last year or so has  been not great with having a discectomy in March which went great. But before that I was in alot of pain and was popping the pills. Naproxen, codeine etc just to have some sort of relief. Could it be that that's caused this with my digestion. Anyway I think I am going to ask for an endoscopy when I go back to see the GP as these pills you get prescribed just give you more problems,  1 like, 22 replies "

After just 10 days on just 15 mg Lansoprazole I developed a painful skin reaction on one arm. But the weird thing is - the skin looks normal - no rash or redness. So I don't think I got across to the GP how bad it is. If I inadvertently scratch or slightly rub a little bit of skin it's as if I have stuck my arm in a fire. I normally have a high pain tolerance but this has me screaming and writhing. 4 days on and OTC oral antihistamine isn't helping. Nor will my arm accept any sort of cream. I've googled and can't find any reference to anything like it. Will it settle on it's own and when? Reluctant to go back to the GP as there isn't anything to see. 0 likes, 1 reply "
Proton Pump Inhibitors,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/came-off-lansoprazole-help-worse-than-ever--687349,Came off lansoprazole - help!!! Worse than ever. ,"Hiya, I'm writing this for my husband. He is 28 years old and has been on lansoprazole for about 7/8 years. He first started on them after an  acute episode of acid. He came off a few months. A few months later his symptoms returned and the doctor put him back on them. After this if he has tried to come off, he has terrible rebound symptoms, so the doctor said he should continue taking them indefinitely. His kidney function has decreased slowly during his time on them and doctors have always dismissed this. He began feeling very fatigued, feeling sick, loss of appetite, so he went to the doctors. They did a blood test and it revealed his kidney function was at 57%. We made the link between lansoprazole and chronic kidney disease. He has to have s blood test in January to see if his kidney function still remains low, if it dies, he will be officially diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. He has weaned himself from 30mg to 15mg for two weeks and was fine. He stopped altogether and started ranitidine 150mg twice a day for 10 days. He got to the point where he had horrific bloating, gas, loss of appetite, sickness, his stomach was in pain too. He has had to go back on lansoprazole 15mg through not being able to bear it. He has been on them again now for 3 days and feels awful and they haven't worked like they did before. We feel stuck as to what to do to ease symptoms, as we don't want any problems with ulcers etc but also don't want to further damage his kidneys. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you. 0 likes, 10 replies "

I used to get these terrible throbbing pains in my upper stomach, which would spread upwards into my food pipe. The pain would get worse and worse, and go right through to my back. When it first happened I thought I was having a heart attack! The Lansoprazole is very effective. I started on 30mg for about two years, then went down to 15mg for about 6-months, but then the pains came back, at times so badly that I had to walk out of work meetings and go home as it was impossible for me sit there and disguide the pain I was in. I'm now back up to 30mg daily. My doctor says the government recommends 15mg but that doesn't work for everyone. Apparently the government want to make it only avaialble over the counter which worries me, as it costs about ¬£10 for 6 tablets, but at the moment I get a three month prescription for about ¬£7. I have had a gastroscopy (tube down my throat, into my stomach) and all they saw was a little inflammation, I also had treatment for H. Pylori bacteria but that didn't do anything, I suspect because I wasn't infected in the first place. The doctor was at a loss and admitted he was treating my by a process of elimination. It is frustrating to live with this without a clear diagnosis and worries me about long term effects on my health, but most of the time the medication does its job and life goes on as normal. Last night I had a rare, but prolonged attack that kept me awake for two hours, and I tried swallowing air and burping it back out - it seemed to work bizarrely enough! If anyone wants to get in touch re. this please do as I could do with sharing this sometimes with other sufferers instead of feeling like a freak with an exotic disease at the doctors! Thanks.

Finally i went to the doctor and he prescribed me Zantac 150. I didnt want to take Zantac because i was worried about side effects. I asked for a referral to an ENT. ENT doc looked down my throat and said it looked like i had some inflammation. he prescribed me 1 month on omeprazole. i took the omeprazole and my symptoms started to get better over the course of the month. after the month was over i discontinued use and things began to get a LOT worse from here. i began having severe stomach burning sensations, stomach cramps, light headedness upon eating food, and weight loss. this all started causing severe  , i was scared i had canceror something. I went to the ER and the doctor told me i needed PPI. he prescribed me zantac because i told him no about the PPI. within the next week or two my esophagus started to close up and i could not swallow anything except liquids. i was living off of boost and ensure.  by this time i had lost about 20 lbs. i took myself to the ER two more times where the docs couldnt tell me what was wrong. finally i got into a GI doc and they scheduled me for an EGD. i would have to suffer through the weekend in agony while i waited for my EGD. Over that weekend i couldnt eat, i couldnt sleep, and i was having a lot of muscle twitching at night. I remembered i had a bottle of chelated magnesium 250mg. Thinking this would help my muscle twitching because it is good for muscle health i said screw it and took two. this is the first night i could sleep again. the next morning i woke up and i could swallow again. however i still had to get an EGD on that Monday and my fiance urged me to do it for peace of mind. everything was fine, except when the doctor biopsied my stomach, my stomach continued to bleed. I had to have another GI doc fix it and what do they prescribe to heal GI bleeds? PPI. I was on PPI for another 4 months until now. i started to have severe back shoulder and right arm pain. i was also taking 500mg of magnesium a day while on the PPI but it didnt matter because it completely stops my body from absorbing magnesium. 2 days ago i stopped my PPI. i am currently using rolaids, gaviscon advance that i ordered from the UK, and zantac as needed. however my back shoulder and right arm pain is probably 80% resolved, along with a large portion of my anxiety. magnesium deficiency also induces anxiety and stress. does that sound familiar to anyone? anyways this is my story. i have no idea if anyone else has a similar story or experience but i hope this helps someone out there. what i went through i wouldn't wish on anyone. 1 like, 13 replies "

All other tests - liver, kidneys, blood count, heart, lungs, bone health, thyroid, no H Pylori, BP, temp - all fine. Feel anxious but I'm getting better at coping with it. When I went to the Dr on the 14th February I only had 2 symptoms, slight discomfort in oesophagus when swallowing and pain between shoulder blades when eating. The Dr diagnosed silent reflux, ulcer or   or all 3. Now that I am on PPIs I can not come off them. During the day I am reasonably fine, appetite reduced but managing to eat but during the night I can not sleep. I will sleep for 2 or 3 hours then I'm awake either just wide awake or feeling sick. By 6am I am desperate to take lanzoprazole.  I pop a pill, have some weetabix and in about an hour I feel fine. The thing I don't understand is my symptoms only got worse when I started the drugs? I barely had indigestion when I went to the Dr on the 14th February, I was eating and sleeping fine, exercising, going to work etc. Now that I'm on the PPIs I'm off sick from work, and feel debilitated by it. The problem is I can't come off them because I get acid rebound. What the hell has happened to me? I think if I could just get 6 hours of sleep in one night at least I could cope with this.

I tried pretty much everything you could imagine to cure it or even reduce it but nothing was a cure. Cortaid with aloe was the only temporary fix but that too had its limits.

The itching stopped - virtually within a few days or weeks... I'm not sure because I wasn't expecting it and I just kind of noticed. I didn't realize it at first but it had to have been the terbinafine. I swear that's what did it. I must have had some internal fungal infection that it cleared up nearly overnight.

I had tryed every cream, ointment, treatment that I could. I researched new treatments online all the time, I even tried taking an oral treatment that tasted really disgusting, but it did nothing. A doctor that been helping me with this condition the past couple of years even consulted with many other specialists for me, ones that specialized in rectal conditions and they would just come up with the same things. But one thing she did recommend was trying ice treatments which played a huge part in my recovery. So here is what I did. I decided to try an aggressive treatment of hydrocortisone ointment, which they dont really recommend long term. Now ,I used the ointment not the cream. For those of you that suffer from this, we know the worst time is at night. So the first night of treatment, when I was itching really bad, I used an  ice pack , it was kind of weird  but I was willing to try it, I was desperate to get rid of the itching. You will want to cover your ice pack with a wash cloth. Then do the ice for about 10 -20 minutes. Then apply the hyrocortisone ointment. You will want to do this right before you go to sleep. Don't give in to scratching. Then I took a sleep aid. Tylenol PM will work, but if you have Ambion even better.  That was the first night. It worked really good, I had to really use extreme self control though, because I was still itchy. Then of course you will want to use wipes, I just used the Charmin ones. Use those after every bowel movement. Then I applied the hydro cortisone ointment 4 times a day for 7-10 days, that was my plan. So the second night, I did the same thing, ice treatment, sleeping aid, ointment. Also, it helps to take a warm shower or bath before going to bed, and never use soap, just water.  So I got through the second day, still feeling itchy but I was determined to not scratch. Also, get some of those finger cots when applying the ointment so you dont use your finger nails at all by accident. I get them at the drug store, in the bandaid section.  Then something amazing started happening the 3rd day. I realized I was not feeling very itchy, the 3rd night , I did not need ice or sleeping aid. I was so relieved and excited . I can't tell you the sense of relief I was feeling. This condition had been torturing me for so long, I did not remember what it felt like to not have to think about scratching and the relentless itch. It was really starting to effect me.  I kept up with the 3-4 times a day ointment for a little beyond a week. Then I started tapering off using it. What I replaced it with was just pure lanolin cream and applied that at night to help heal all the broken skin. That is working really well.You can use it during the day too if needed. The days that followed were awesome, not itching, relief, I couldnt believe it. It was working! After 7-10 days no itching at all! Amen !  I am still being really diligent with using wipes instead of toilet paper, prob for along time. YOu have to be careful leave any fecal matter to irritate that skin down there. Only blot and dab, no rubbing. I will use the lanolin for awhile too. Because its been going on so long, I figure I need some time to heal. And I will dab a little hydrocortisone if absolutely needed.  I hope this works for alot of you out there that I have been reading about suffering from this ridiculous, relentless, torturous itch!  It has worked for me and I feel like a new person. It has been now almost 2 weeks since I have felt the urge to scratch, the longest in 3 years.

I've had an itchy backside for about 10months now. I had the itchy Ness I also had cuts in that area which I found out was a fissure, I haddn't been straining or anything but it seemed to be something that would come and go but the itchyness would stay.  As far as things I had tried in 10months  you name it I've tried it. Aloe Vera gel, arnica gel, cutting out dairy, cutting out meat, cutting out dizzy drinks, Sainsbury's own antiseptic cream, boots own antiseptic cream, steroid cream ( this made it worse) destin nappy rash cream, zinc oxide cream with peppermint, a cream prescribed to me by the doctor, manuka honey, regular honey, SUDACREM preparation h gel.  So for the past 3 weeks I have been healed fully no itching, the cuts ( tears) in that area have been healed and I'm all back to normal. All thanks to two people who post on this group.  I've been a long time reader of this site in the hopes to clear up this horrible affliction.  So what helped me was, I stopped using toilet paper and started using wipes from. Preparation h. I'm. In the UK you can get them From Boots or on amazon they are about 4pounds. They contain which Hazel. I also used ANUSOL suppositories and the cream. I used both because I had the cream from When I had hemmaroids previously. I had tried the preparation H gel but it didn't do anything however these wipes have changed my life.  I also bought some betadine, I put this on some tissue applied this at night then followed with a suppository. It took me about a week and a half to be fully healed. I only used the betadine for 4 days untill the cuts were all healed up.  The suppositories are annoying because you have to keep them in and can feel Like you need to go and you can pass them so you have to use more but they do work. If you pass a suppository pop in another one.  They will leave a mark on your underwear as they melt but it washes out.  The other thing I was using during this time was physillium husks. I would take a glass of this in the morning with a bit of orange juice and some water and add two spoonfuls of this into the water and orange juice and drink it straight away.  I did this daily for a week also.  So I gope this helps all of you suffering out there. Its a nightmare, please let me know how you get on with this and the best of luck. It feels like as if there's no way out but the nightmare will end!  Best of luck!    0 likes, 1 reply "

Pruritus Ani,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-think-i-ve-finally-beaten-pruritus-ani-665594,I think i‚Äôve finally beaten Pruritus Ani,"My Story (Sorry if It gets graphic, I think its important to give you the full detail, and like many of you I have gone past the point of caring what people think in order to overcome this horrible condition) How I got Pruritus Ani In December 2014, aged 36 I came down with a stomach bug like i‚Äôve never experienced before.¬† My son brought it home from school. For 5 days I had diarrhoea and vomiting non-stop, to the point, that all I had left was some strange mucus passing through my bowels. During this period of sickness, I visited the doctors for help, and they prescribed an anti-biotic, which 4 years later i‚Äôve discovered was the worst possible thing for me. I appreciate that what caused my Pruritus Ani might be different to others, but the way I overcome it might work for many of you sufferers. What I tried Soon after my sickness bug I started getting a burning sensation and pain after every bowel movement, which was really uncomfortable for a few hours after.¬† At the time I was wearing skinny jeans all the time, which didn‚Äôt help the situation as there was no air getting into the area and I was causing friction as I was moving. Over time the burning and pain became worse, but then the itching started, which is where I really struggled. I cant begin to tell you how this has affected my life.¬† I love playing golf and football, but found I could only play these sports at 5pm when the pain and itching had calmed down.¬† The only positive that came with this condition for me was around 10 hours after a bowel movements it became bearable again, but if I had 2-3 movements a day it would ruin the whole day for me. Above all simple games, tasks and walks with my young children was hard to enjoy and that started making me depressed, because I couldn‚Äôt be the father I wanted to be for them. My biggest problem was all of my bowel movements were slimy or soft, which meant I could never get clean, I had to return to the toilet 2-3 times to clean myself, which is hard work when your out and about. So in the last 4 years I have tried this‚Ä¶.. Cotton wool balls in the area to keep dry and stop friction Wearing shorts EVERY day Wearing lose underwear Portable Bidets Showering after the toilet (not easy out and about) Anti fungal Talc About 5 anti fungal creams 2-3 Pro biotic creams Anti biotic creams About 8-9 steroid creams (always made it worse) Operation to remove fissures Operation to band haemorrhoids About 10 other creams (I promise this is not exaggerated) Excercise Change of diet at least 10 times Ice baths Warm baths Hot baths Bath salts Ice Packs Pain Killers Anti fungal tablets - terbanifine Keffer Milk Pro biotic supplements Fibre drinks Physlium husk and about 5 other types of supplements I‚Äôve probably tried other things to destroy this hideous condition, and I‚Äôm sure there were times when I was trying about 5 of the above at the same time Frustratingly none of them worked, so about 3 months ago I accepted my fate and gave up.¬† I continued using Aveeno cream, as this was the only natural cream that gave me a tiny bit of relief. I decided my lifestyle would have to accommodate Pruritus Ani I.e. exercise, sports and activities with my children would be really difficult but I would try and do them in the evening when things were a bit calmer.¬† The itching, burning and pain was just part of me now and so be it. The cure About 3 weeks ago, the condition got much much worse, bleeding, pain, constant itching.¬† Now i‚Äôve always suspected my diet was a contributor as you will see above, I tried multiple diets and it was diet!!! After seeing 4 specialists in gastro, bowels etc I was always ending up at dermatology, who kept prescribing creams. So during this particularly nasty period, it just dawned on me that I had a couple of beers and quite a bit of carbonated drinks (Coke Zero) and coffee along with 2 take aways. I would usually drink water throughout the day and wine was usually my choice of alcoholic drink and I rarely eat take aways. This prompted me to see a nutritionist, as in the back of my mind i‚Äôve always known my diet was causing this, but didn‚Äôt want to accept it as it would mean a big change, especially with wine, which I love. This is by far the best ¬£140 I have spent in my life (¬£90 for my consultation and ¬£50 for supplements) The challenge for me is I like fried food, processed food, wine, bread, cheese all the amazing things.¬† So if you want to try what i‚Äôve done, then you need to commit to saying goodbye to all of these to start with. So in a nutshell, the nutritionist straight away diagnosed¬† an inflammable gut, more than likely caused by all the bacteria leaving my system in 2014 after my sickness bug and then the anti biotic killing off any remaining bacteria, which has caused a massive imbalance, which i‚Äôve never repaired. This has been a complete miracle.¬† All i‚Äôve done in the last 5 days is change my diet to an anti inflammatory diet and I‚Äôm 100% completely cured IN 5 DAYS!!!! I will of course have to maintain this diet, and it can be a bit challenging at times, especially as I‚Äôm writing this on a Friday evening in the sunshine about to go home to the garden and watch my wife have a glass of wine without me. I will re-introduce some naughty foods and drinks (wine) in a couple of months, but only in moderation. The foods that the nutritionist told me to eat were‚Ä¶. Canned Oily Fish Olive Oil Coconut oil Berries (blueberries, strawberries etc) Green Leaves (spinach, kale etc) Tomatoes Beetroots Walnuts/Almonds These all combat inflammation. So I‚Äôm incorporating all of the above into my meals with other anti inflammatory foods.¬† Here is a typical day for me now Breakfast - Plain porridge with flax seeds, crushed walnuts and blueberries OR Scrambled egg with tomatoes and spinach Snack - Peanut butter and apple and a natural yogurt Lunch - Salad with oily fish or Vegetable soup (home made) Snack - orange, plum, peach Dinner - Turkey/Chicken/Salmon with carrots, sweetcorn, peas, broccoli etc I‚Äôve done that for 5 days and I have zero symptoms and even a knee problem i‚Äôve had for 3 months has completely disappeared (also historically inflamed) I walked out of the nutritionists at first complaining to myself that I cant stick to this, I don‚Äôt have time to make soups and prepare food for work or eat every 3 hours and not snack past 9pm, its too difficult.¬† I work 12 hours a day and have a busy family home as well.¬† However I didn‚Äôt give up this time,¬† I‚Äôve found the time and if I can anyone can. Im sure some of you will read this and think, its not my diet and even if it is I cant make these changes they are too difficult.¬† Take it from someone who has tried that huge exhausted list above and gave up multiple times trying to cure this, I cant stop smiling now. I have been to the toilet three times today and wiped with normal tissue paper and used NO creams, I took a 2 mile walk in the baking sun and I have no itching or burning.

Pruritus Ani,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/mysterious-itching-of-the-vulva-and-anus-646933,Mysterious Itching of the Vulva and Anus,"I was wondering if anybody could offer me some advice. Just after Christmas (almost 3 months ago now), I started experiencing itching around my vulva/anus after a sexual encounter with my boyfriend. Prior to this encounter, I had shaved ""down there"" with a new, very sharp razor and used a new product (Johnson's baby oil gel) instead of shaving cream. At first, I associated the itch to the hair growing back--but it seemed to be itching a little more than usual. It might also be worth mentioning that I had just come off of a two-year course of the drug Spironolactone around this time, and this drug is known to play with one's hormones. In addition to that, I have suffered from bulimia for 10 years and I have been recovering for just about one year now. I know the Spiro/bulimia probably did my gut   no favours, and I know gut problems can cause issues down yonder.¬† When the itch did not disappear after a week, my boyfriend and I went to get tested for STDs, all negative. The boyfriend has no symptoms.¬† Around this time, I also learned that a herpes test is not included in the standard STD panel. I asked my doctor about it and she said that in the absence of lesions, she wouldn't test me for it (ridiculous, right?). My boyfriend's doctor told him something similar. I became obsessive about checking my area with a 10x magnification mirror several times daily, and I've never succeeded in finding any external symptoms. Plus, the duration of my symptoms (going on 3 months straight now) leads me to suspect that what is going on is not herpes-related.¬† Next, I went to see my dermatologist and had him examine ""down there."" He is a famous dermatologist in my city and I trust his opinion. He prescribed me doxycycline for mild folliculitis on my butt cheeks that he assured me is not herpes.¬† I should also mention that I initially thought I had contracted a yeast infection, so I took an oral antibiotic for that which did nothing.¬† Since then, the itch comes and goes, but it is there every day at some point. It feels almost like the skin around my anus is ever so slightly cracked, or being pulled. The vulva itch is also very subtle, but it shows up for a few minutes a few times a day. I even sometimes get a slight itch inside my vagina. Occasionally, I feel the itch on my bikini line as well. There are also times I feel like my whole area ""down there"" is ever so slightly sore. I'm not sure how much if the itching/soreness is due to anxiety at this point. Either way, I am at a loss of what to do. I have been using 100% emu oil to moisturize the areas which really helps but the itch always comes back if I don't moisturize for a while.¬† I've considered that it might be lichen sclerosis, but I don't seem to have any discolouration going on.¬† If anybody has any advice, I would love to hear it.

I am wondering if I am cleaning too much though? I have 2 questions: I saw a dermatologist a few weeks back who gave me pretty decent advice. She advised me to 'calm things down a bit'. She told me to never wipe 'inside' the anus (beyond the external sphincter), and after a bowel motion to apply an emollient  cream after gently washing with water.

Reading through what others are posting about, my symptoms are not as severe as other peoples. I have no aches and pains anywhere other than the stiffness in two fingers and 1 toe and the joints of these. And also the Psorasis on my scalp. Is Methotrexate a bit extreme for me?

Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/swollen-lymph-nodes-and-rashes-604335,Swollen lymph nodes and rashes,"To start, I am a relatively healthy 20 year old female living in Canada. For the past 7 months I have had multiple health complications. I am becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of caring and general knowledge within the Canadian health care system. Starting in January (7 months ago) I began seeing a small red blistering thing on my chest. I didn't think anything of it until a few more spots appeared all over my body. I went to a walk in clinic and was diagnosed with pityriasis rosea. I wasn't upset with this because it appeared I had a very mild case with only a few spots. A few weeks later, after a cocaine bender (I know), I became very sick with a fever and sore throat. I went to the clinic and was diagnosed with strep (positive throat swab.) About a week after that I started noticing pain in my armpit and a lump deep under my skin, not visible on the surface, about a 2inch diameter. I also noticed my rash got significantly worse, covering my entire body. I went to the clinic about the lump and was told it was a cyst and to stop shaving my armpits. I was given more antibiotics for this ""cyst."" The doctor noticed my PR rash and told me I should see a dermatologist because it had been over 6 weeks of having the rash, which is abnormal. The lump in my armpit diminished over the next few weeks so I assumed this was a result of the antibiotics. After over 3 long months of tanning beds and hundreds of creams and ""home remedies"" ¬†my pityriasis rosea cleared up in April. I fell sick again with another sore throats and went to the clinic. I was given antibiotics for strep before getting the lab results of the test. I took antibiotics for about a week until I was informed the test was negative. I developed a bright red rash all over my body from the antibioics, which usually happens when you have mono and are wrongly given antibiotics. The rash and sore throats went away and I didn't think anything of it. However, my armpit lump continued to flare up throughout this and I was getting new and very uncomfortable swelling in my neck. I went back to the clinic and was told the armpit lump was actually a lymph node, which I had kind of assumed all along as I had spent hours on google researching my symptoms. I got a blood test for mono and an ultrasound of my lymph node. All of this was done at walk in clinics as I live away from home, and from my family doctor, during the school year. The mono test came back negative and the ultrasound indicated my lymph node was reacting to something. I came home and started getting flare ups of a rash on my back and chest, red spots that resembled PR, that would come and be gone after a few days. My lypmph nodes continued to swell, especially my neck. I saw my family doctor who ordered a blood test for a bunch of things: mono, HIV, mumps, the first test for lupus and some other things to help her indicate an auto immune disease. She also made me get another ultrasound and a needle in my armpit to test the lymph node. She said for the blood test everything came back normal except that I have iron deficiency and the lymph nodes are reactive. My lymph nodes continued to swell and bother me. I saw an internal medicine specialist who basically told me nothing. After another drug binge I came down with strep throat again. About two weeks after this diagnosis red dots started forming all over my body, similar to my PR but smaller and more itchy. I saw a dermatologist and was diagnosed with guttate psoriasis. There is no history of psoriasis in my family. So I am sitting here covered from head to toe in itchy red bumps writing this, reaching out to the internet. It just seems like something really weird to me that I could go my whole life without having any sort of rash or real health problems and in the past 7 months so many things have gone wrong. I'm starting to feel like my body will never be normal. I'm reaching out to the internet because I don't really have anyone to talk to about this and maybe someone has a similar case to me? I am starting to think there is something wrong with my immune system in which it is overactive. I think the underlying cause of this is possibly something neurological, maybe from the drugs? It seems like there's nothing actually wrong yet my immune system is set in overdrive. I have been doing chemical drugs (molly and cocaine) for about a year, regularly but not extremely often (every two weeks maybe.)¬† 0 likes, 2 replies "

Are these conditions  difficult to use identify with tests?

PTSD - Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/ptsd-from-childhood-can-anyone-realate-does-anyone-have-any-similar-experiences--683457,"PTSD from childhood, can anyone realate? Does anyone have any similar experiences?","I was diagnosed with PTSD almost one year ago and am still trying to understand it. My childhood was kind of chaotic.  My parents were arguing about money all the time and screaming at each other every night. Both my parents are alcoholics, my Dad would come home drunk or high every night. Long story short, things at home were never stable. By the time I entered high school, my situation at home was effecting my school work. When I was younger I got used to my parents being out late. I was usually with them and would beg them to go home because I had school the next day.  When my parents weren't out late, they brought friends to our house. It was mostly my Dad, as I got older my mom kind of slowly stopped partying as much as my Dad. I remember to this day, laying wide awake at night, I could hear my Dad's music turned up really loud and people yelling and laughing. Eventually by the end of the night my parents were having a screaming match. My mom would start an argument with my Dad over me having school the next day. She usually took it too far, cursing at him and sometimes hitting him. I remember it like it was yesterday, him telling her ""God I would like to knock your teeth out right now! Your a crazy B****, you need to go back on your meds!"". My mom used to write down all the things he said to her, it was heartbreaking to hear. So most nights growing up I cried myself to sleep, more often than not, my mom would join me in my room. She just couldn't be in there with my Dad. I remember telling her ""We have to get out of here."" She grab my hand and say ""I know"" with a crack in her voice. It sucked, and eventually when I got to high school I started missing school even more than usual. I used to love school but just never really had the opportunity to just focus on my education. My dad expected me to do well in school, to the point where I was scared to death of fialing. When I was younger, school was kind of my escape from my home life but eventually, it became jsut as bad. I had a friend, she was my best friends actually. She was like a sister to me but in a way she was my worst enemy. She always bosssed me around, was always making comments about my clothes and weight. I remember all the time I had to hide back my tears when she would call me out in front of a  group of people for wearing the same jeans two days in a row. She knew that my parents didn't have much money for me to spend on clothing and when they did it was spent on unpaid bills or alcohol. There were times that a group of us would be at her house after school and she would let me eat at her house. All the other girls got pizza but no me, she said I didn't need it, I was already gaining too much weight. Sometimes it wasn't even the weight comments (even though I was not overweight.) it was the fact that I didn't have much food at home and just one slice of that pizza may have been the only thing I ate the rest of the day. She abused me, emotionally and physically. This post is already too long so I am going skip through the rest of the details. My depression started my sophmore year of high school, then my junior year my anxiety, and by my senior year I was dropped from high school because of low attendance. I was hospitalized for two weeks and after that I just couldn't bring my self to go back to school. I went back into my depression after being dropped from school. That lasted for almost one year. I eventually got into counseling and am seeing a psychiatrist. I have been taking Wellbutrin for almost a year and I think it has really helped. I overcame my anxiety and finally got my GED and am about to start classes at a community college. This may not seem like much but it was huge accomplishment for me. Getting my GED gave me so much anxiety and I just started holding it off. I feel like I have gone a long way the past few years but every time I feel like I am making progress, I remember something from my childhood. Random little things bring back all the unwanted memories and it just sucks. I haven't really been able to open up to anyone, even myself, about what went on during my childhood. I know I need to talk about it and address it. Does anyone have any similar experiences? Any advice? 0 likes, 1 reply "
PTSD - Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/are-these-flashbacks-or-panic-attacks--683461,Are these flashbacks or panic attacks?,"I babysit for this little boy and the other day I was doing laundry as I usually do. When I finished washing one load of laundry I saw a disposable diaper in the washing machine. I must not have seen it and washed it. There were the little gel beeds from inside the diaper all of the the washing machine and the clothes. Immediately when this happened I got this warm feeling in my face, like a flushed feeling. My heart started beating really faced and I was scared out of my mind. I was terrified that the father of the child I babysit for was going to yell at me. I felt the exact same way I used to feel around my father. When I did something he didn't like it was the end of the world to me. It was like the worst possible thing had happened. I sat down and caught my breathe and realized that I wasn't acting appropiately to the situation, I was over reacting. I eventually put on my big girl panties and shook off the beeds from the clothes then wiped down the washing machine and put in on the spin cylcle to rinse the remaing gel out. TI cleaned up the mess and everything was fine. Even if it wasn't okay, this little boys father was going to be angry and hit me over a diaper. Looking back now I realize how silly it was. But in that moment it was so surreal, like I was a little girl again there with my dad. It wasn't physically though, like I didn't feel that I was physically going back to a memory with my dad, it was just feeling. The same feeling that I was unsafe, that my father was dissapointed in me, that I had let him down, that he may be so angry with he will hit me. It is really weir to describe I guess. I have had similar experiences like this. One time I was out with my family and my mom kept drinking when she promised me she wouldn't. I felt frozen almost, like what happening now wasn't real. But my mind went back to all those time when mI was younger, trying to get my mom to leave a bar and stop drinking. I had that same heartbreaking feeling I had when I was a kid that my mother was choosing alcohol over me. The same things happened here, the flushed face, face heart beat, etc. Has anyone else experience this? Are the just panic attacks or flashbacks? From what I have researched it sounds like an implicit flashback but I am not sure. I see my pychiatrist next month but wanted to know others opinions. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I found the Butrans patches one of the best methods of delivering pain relief. Not having to remember to pill pop every 6 hours was a blessed relief. My GP changed the prescription from Butrans to Butec a generic, and I assume a lot cheaper. I checked it on line and found it was meant to be identical to Butrans. Unfortunately about 2 weeks after starting Butec I started getting a skin reaction under the patch. Week 1 was mildish, Week 2 lifted the skin off after removal of the patch and week 3 lasted 36 hours before I hastily removed it.

So I used to be friends with this guy and he is quite popular and smart. He has lots of friends and enjoys hanging out with people. He's the type of guy who goes on how well he does in his life and how popular he is, including how everyone goes to his house or in town and how he has a great time all the time. I would say hi to him if I saw him and he would run the opposite direction, he seemed scared so I asked if he was okay or if I had done anything to maybe upset him but he said he was fine and that I didn't do anything. I found out on an occasion where he admitted to me that he was harming himself and that he was having nightmares which made feel really concerned for him and I promised him that I would keep it a secret. After the end of every discussion I would have with him he would run away again. Recently I thought that he had another episode of trying to harm himself which made me panic and tried contacting him. Only to find him laughing and chatting with his friends. I asked if I could meet him around where he lived to talk to him about how he's been acting with me and to apologise for coming to conclusions about his depressive state. He said that he would only talk on the phone with me but in the past he would just put the phone down and not conclude the issue. So I refused and asked to see him in person, I informed him that I would be in town to meet him and that he could text me his address as he said he was unwell. So I arrived in the town and left him a couple of voicemails asking where he was and said that I would see him the following week at the workplace wishing him well if he didn't show. He never turned up or replied to my messages. So i'm back at the work place the week after and spot him, so I touch him on the arm to talk to him about him not seeing me the other day. HE FREAKS OUT. He begins screaming at me and telling me to get off him and accused me of stalking him. I was really shocked and got very emotional after this and tried explaining that I was worried and wanted to talk things through. He accused me of not being normal and how normal people don't talk things through in person but on the phone. He informed me that he rang the police and filed a complaint about me because he was scared for his safety. After our confrontation I immediately informed other members of staff about the confrontation and was seriously shaken by the ordeal. The department investigated the problem and found that he only rang the police for advice on an unwanted person at the door where they gave a generic answer to just not open it, he did not file a complaint about me or give them my name. The staff concluded that he had overreacted and to not expect and apology from him. They informed me that he had a bad past experience with another person turning up at his house unwanted and the police were called on that situation. They strongly hinted towards him having PTSD. I informed staff about his depressive state and they said they would take appropriate action. I don't know if he has PTSD or whether this was an excuse for his scary behaviour but he seems fine chatting with his friends and hanging out, including his friends saying he's acting fine. Plus he said in the past how he would invite his friends round to his place so it doesn't make sense in how he's reacted with me. I am very nervous returning to the work place as I work in the same room as him as I don't know if he will have another outburst with me. I have blocked him on all modes of communication and certain members of staff are aware of the situation and are keeping an eye out just in case. What do you guys think? Sammy 0 likes, 1 reply "

Me and my boyfriend have been together nearly 6 years everything was perfect we bought our dream home and we planned our future for when he came out the army. March last year he left the army and to start with everything was good then last June he decided out of no where things weren't working and he wanted space so I moved back to my mums. After a couple of weeks he told me it was over and he didn't want to be with me anymore. I was destroyed heartbroken to me it came out of no where and he destroyed all our dreams and plans. Then after about of month of being nasty to each other and arguing he admitted to me he had been to the doctors and had been diagnosed with PTSD he had been put on tablets and put in touch with a counsellor. He told me he felt he needed me around but couldn't make any promises about out relationship and if I couldn't cope to walk away. I still loved him unconditionally so I stood by him and was there when he needed me and gave him space when he needed it. It was heartbreaking to watch the man I fell in love with who had always been so strong falling apart and I couldn't do anything to make it all better. He started to get better and as he did our relationship started to mend and by Christmas we were back living together and rebuilding our relationship. It was hard he went through phases of being really loving to being distant but I started to learn to give him space I even stayed at my mums once a week to give him some time on his own. Then a few weeks ago it happened again exactly the same time as last year he said he needed some space he still loved me but asked me to go to my mums for a while. This time it was slightly different cuz he phoned me regularly text me all the time and we saw each other and when we did it was like normal. Then the last week he distant himself from me and then at the weekend said it wanted to end it. I know this is his PTSD but I don't know what I can do to help him and make him see the answer isn't giving up on us. I love him unconditionally and would do anything for him but I feel so helpless and lost. Hope someone can help. X 3 likes, 45 replies "

I've recently been diagnosed with a dermoid cyst and polycystic ovaries. Between the ages of 14 and 17 I only had four periods.  I started the pill for contraceptive reasons at 17 and had regular periods then. I'm 22 now and in April I thought I was pregnant- morning sickness, tender boobs, weight gain, needing to pee frequently but negative pregnancy tests. Then i had heavy midcycle bleeding which lasted 9 days and bad pain in my right side which has been on going ever since. My doctor sent me for an ultrasound which showed I have a 4.5cm dermoid cyst on my left ovary (they think there's fat in it but they're not sure) and that my right ovary is polycystic.  I met with the gynae for the first time last week and didn't like his attitude. He said ""well everyone has a cyst on their ovary"" and that my pain is probably just pms. He told me to stop taking the pill and I have another appointment with him at the end of september. I'm just so confused about what's causing all the pain in my right side now. And I don't understand why he took me off the pill.  Can anyone shed some light on the situation?? Any thing at all would be greatly appreciated.

Recently, I've learned that my Mother has suffered diabetes in the past. I guess that's why I have PCOS in the first place.  I don't have diabetes because I'm 115 lbs. I knew one of my relatives must have had it. PCOS has made me feel completely  undesirable! I can't feel good about my looks anymore. Hair is all over my body! I don't feel pretty anymore! It's hard for me to masturbate when I can't get in the mood. I can barely focus on my sexual fantasies when I can't see how anyone would even want me at all! I've lost my confidence! I hate PCOS! I hate my body! My Mother doesn't seem to understand what I'm going through! She days that I shouldn't worry about it, but that's very difficult. Especially when she has passed her crippling anxiety down to me! I'm close to starting school again, and I'm an honor student! So I'm dealing with enough already! I don't love myself! I hate myself! It's difficult to find anything to love about myself! I'm honestly  losing sleep because of this!  Sometimes I fall asleep before exercising, because I'm exhausted from dealing with life. I have to exercise every day to keep my body from sprouting any hairs the next day! I used to love sweets. Now I can't eat anything sweet because it makes my hirsutism situation worse! My parents think I'm acting weird when I say I don't want sweets. I have had a closed-head injury (my parents don't know about this self-inflicted injury; I've told my Mother that I felt depressed in the past and she told me to ""stop being depressed"" like its a f*****g choice; my Father wants to get help for me but my Mother has all the power in this family) in the past and it's hard for me to remember to stop eating sweets. I've also forgotten some basic things like grammar and how to spell certain words! I have a terrible sweating problem that makes me smell bad so I hate going outside. School has been Hell on Earth for the past year and a half because of that. So hate my appearance and I feel like a total idiot! It's like I've been cursed or something!

Cut the story short, I have just been for a ultrasound as my acne has not cleared and my periods are not irregular but are 32-36 days and accompanied with spotting either side of cycle (approx 3 days before and after my 5 day cycle) anyway a few hours ago I literally found out I have polycystic ovaries, the sonographer was horrific, I didnt even have the chance to even say hello, was taken in room, test done, results handed to me with a information sheet. Both my left ovary and right ovary have came back 'Polycystic'¬† Now this is the heartbreaking part, I am getting married August 2018 to my amazing supportive partner. I wanted to take my coil out JUST before wedding and try for a baby. But now with this news I am HORRIFIED, my plan to hopefully fall pregnant around the wedding has now been taken away from me. Now my predicament is, first thing is removing my coil which I am doing next Wednesday. I just really dont know what to do next, do i start trying and risk being heavily pregnant on my wedding day (although PCOS has slimmed my chances) or do I have the wedding and risk go through the stress of taking ages to fall pregnant or possibly never falling pregnant.

I'm new here and have a question about my blood tests. So I figured I would be proactive and order my own blood test and check to make sure I am healthy while trying to get pregnant. Everything was normal, including my magnesium levels, which was great, but on my CBC, my red blood cell count, hemoglobin and hematocrit were all high. This wasn't a first time thing. For the last 3 years of blood tests, my hemoglobin and hematocrit have remained high, sometimes my WBC would be high and then sometimes my RBC would be high or sometimes my lymphocytes would be high as well. Nothing was ever critical high, but just high. I also had a high Erythorocytes Sedimentation Rate (which just is a test for inflammation) and a Low Urea Nitrogen level (this was in 2015 though).¬† I was seeing a doctor a couple years ago when this started and he threw out ""polycythemia,"" but he said that would be extremely rare for my age (I'm 28). He tried to rule out secondary polycythemia and ordered chest x-rays, thyroid tests, etc and everything else was fine with me. During this time, I found out I also have Heterozygous Factor V Lieden, which just means I am at higher risk of a blood clot in my life, but doesn't mean I will for sure get one. I have to take extra care during pregnancy as it could make me have miscarriages as well. I did see a Hematologist and he didn't seem to worried about Factor V or my high blood test. He said he doubts it is polycythemia because of my age. But neither doctor ever figured out why my blood tests remained abnormal for so long.¬† The only symptoms I have is constant fatigue (even after full night sleep) and itchy skin after exercise or hot showers/baths. That's it. My vitamin D level was low at one time, but it's normal again. I take tons of vitamins now to try to stay healthy. I don't really work out, but I am 5'1 and 115 pds. I have a drink or two a night, 4 times a week or more. I don't smoke. I eat healthy. I drink a ton of water everyday.¬† Hubby says we will notify the OB when I get pregnant and show him my current blood tests and see what he says. He doesn't think it's something I need to worry about right now if it's not affecting me. He hates going to the doctors and I don't blame him for that. After going to my last doctor for a year trying to figure out what was wrong and spending a TON of money, it was frustrating and useless. Ever since my last doctor threw out the word Polycythemia, it has worried me though. I wish he never suggested it. Does anyone have the same problem as me? Is this something I should worry about?

A little background.  I'm a 49 yo female living in Ontario, Canada.  I was recently referred to internal medicine at my local hospital after my primary physician noticed my rbc, hematocrit and hemoglobin levels have been continuously elevated over the past couple of years along with my WBC, mainly neutrophils.  I have periodic bloodwork to monitor TSH level as I have Hashimoto's Hypothyroidism.  For context, my last CBC was: WBC 13.3 (range 4-11) the highest it's been from the 7 labs I have copies of is 14.6 Neutrophils 9.2 (range 2-7.5) RBC 5.15 (range 4-5.10) Hemoglobin 167 (range 120-160) Hematocrit .480(range .350-.450) Platelet 313 (range 150-400) My CRP & ESR were both well below range so no inflammation.   No infections that I'm aware of and Creatinine also normal which would help identify if there was  . Various symptoms that seem to come and go in waves  include headaches, burning red eyes,  chronic pain in hips and legs and feet (this symptom is consistent and it's difficult to know if it's muscle or bone pain), red flecks under the skin on palms of hands (that don't itch or blanch and never go away), periodic bouts of severe  , hot flashes and excessive sweating &   & fatigue, some numbness in extremities and intermittent  . I should also point out it was discovered in 2016 that I was severely anemic (ferritin was <5 and B12 was also low).  I experienced painful periods with heavy bleeding, including clots so I was referred for an endometrial ablation.  I had the procedure done in October, 2016 and periods stopped.  Ever since, RBC counts have been continuously on the rise along with WBCs. Saw internal medicine in November of 2018 who ordered JAK 2 V617F mutation and EPO test along with abdominal ultrasound.  Just got results back last week.  Ultrasound came back fine but I tested positive for JAK 2 mutation and EPO was low normal.  Doctor indicated my history of heavy bleeding prior to ablation likely masked this issue I'm now encountering.  In essence, my body was previously blood letting naturally.  Anyhow, he prescribed low dose daily aspirin and is referring me on to hematologist for further consultation and care.  I'm currently awaiting a call for that appointment to be scheduled.  He did mention that bloodwork and symptoms point strongly towards either PV or ET although I would expect my platelets to be higher if it were ET.

The outcome being, just what we thought, that he has PMR!   Or, PPR, as the French call it. He has gradually reduced to 10mg Pred, with no problems so far. The Rheumy has asked him to reduce down to 5mg by beginning of September...  sounds a bit soon... One of his tests was bone-density and it came back normal.  We understand that taking Pred could lead to  . Rheumy has written: "" The patient is having a corticosteroid therapy,  and treatment with oral bisphosphonates is essential, with densimetric control during 2 years"".  (Translation) She has prescribed Risedronate 75 mg (Actonel) which we understand is a Bisphosphonate.  He is supposed to take it 2 consecutive days each month, standing-up, to protect the oesophogas.! We've been reading about it - including reviews - and it looks awful.  People say they've had terrible experiences with this medicine. I don't want George to take it. He is a big-boned man. His bone-density is normal at present. He's been taking 1000 mg calcium each day in evenings. Isn't that enough - at least for the time being? Does anyone have experience of this medicine?

In addition to doing a million tests to eliminate anything else, she diagnosed sicca syndrome  which she thinks  actually  been caused by the steriods.     It seems now that I cannot live without the    but  I also cannot live with them. The rheumatologist   assured me that I  would be off Prednisone within 2 years  by following an 'old' protocol.  She also said she was confident   that the adrenal glands would function again using this very slow protocol.   The protocol she suggested  is the ""dead  slow and nearly stop""  protocol with the addition of a full month between each reduction. So,  it would  take  6  full weeks to taper from the old dose to the new dose by 1 mg.   and then another 6 weeks at the new  dose  before beginning the next 1 mg reduction.

Relating this to my own symptoms, from the very first days, the condition mostly spread to an increasing number of joints, not to mention the fatigue, ear-aches, head-aches and later, my palms and the soles of my feet. With prednisone, most symptoms decreased sharply, but as I was on a fast monthly taper regimen of 1mg per month, so symptoms reappeared within six months and new symptoms I hadn't had then also appeared. Years go by, and I have long since taken control of my dosage based on my symptoms ""in real time"". I also noted big seasonal changes in my dosage requirement to the tune of ~100% (worse in Summer, better in Winter, and which persists to this day all of five years later). But it was the ""wandering"" characteristic of PMR symptoms which caught my attention, symptoms that didn't appear to be related to any localized stress where the symptoms appeared. It seemed to me that at times the PMR ""attack"" would mostly leave one area of my body and move to a different area of my body, instead of the overall symptom levels rising and falling in the different areas together. Now I have posted here periodically as I got down to 2mg/day in Winter, only then having to again use up to 5mg/day when the summer months came. To be sure, there has been a long-term trend toward lower dosages, though with the past two years being almost the same (but for the fact that I managed to spare myself the Summer flare-up with more-timely higher dosing. This Winter has now been quite different though. I'd had a lengthy respiratory infection around the holiday season, then a few weeks lapse and then a second, brief, and very different batch of respiratory symptoms with a brief slight   added in. Not normal for me, but not so unusual either. Then just three weeks ago, another prolonged nose/throat/airway infection that really lingered despite causing no really severe symptoms such as a plugged sinus or noticeable fever, though accompanied by a nasty case of pink-eye infection towards the end of it's run. But now the funny thing is that, after cutting my pred intake sharply in order to boost my immune response to the bugs, I suddenly find myself cured of the infections AND taking no prednisone at all. It's been only ten days with no pred, but   and no flaring as of yet. So the question I leave here is whether   perhaps needs some sort of challenging distraction in order for it to focus on the distraction and finally restore pre-PMR order when the infection has been conquered(?). Needless to say, I am extremely optimistic at this point, and hoping my story might give reason for optimism among you all! 1 like, 14 replies "

I have sciatica  with bulging discs on L4/5  and S1 as shown on the MRI diagnosed April 2018.    That seems to have settled down now since I follow a regime of exercise.  But it has left me with 2 numb toes (the last 2 little toes) and numb feeling along side the foot on one leg.   I managed this so far with very little analgesia. Three / 4 days ago, I was doing some moderate gardening, and after that I felt this pain on my leg (same left leg all the time) .  At the time I thought it was my sciatica , so i was mindful of my posture and exercise and had to take analgesia to manage the pain.   However,  this pain become quite constant and gripping, and i could hardly bear weight on it.   And it reminded me of the type of pain I had when I have flare ups.   The only small relief i have is by lying down or sitting down. I am on 7mgs  of Pred using the DSAS  method, and it seems fine so far , until now!

I do have some basic PMR Questions. If one didn‚Äôt take any Pred, would PMR eventually go away?  I would assume so. I‚Äôve assumed that the ‚Äústrength‚Äù (if that‚Äôs the right word) of the PMR disease decreases over time, since the amount of Pred required to be pain free (or relatively pain free) decreases as well over time.  So, hypothetically, if one stayed at a specific Pred dose, would the strength of the PMR disease continue to decrease?  and is that why one is able to decrease Pred?  Again I would assume yes. I guess the question is: what exactly makes PMR eventually go away?  Is it just a question of time?  Or does the Pred dosage have anything to do with it? Also, does too much exercise cause the PMR to strengthen, ie. flare up?   If so, why? A related question is: when PMR flares up (because of reducing Pred too quickly), is the PMR disease actually strengthening?  Or does it just seem to be doing so?

INTENSE pain in piraformis muscle. Also the side of my left hip.  After tiring of my RHUMY who seems to do nothing I got an MRI on my hips to rule out other issues.  They found nothing abnormal.  Dr. suggested PT for the hip but I opted for a chiropractor.  7 sessions and exercises  and it was total relief.  I felt I was taking prednisone for just that for two years. Determined to get off this stuff I've gotten myself down from 20 to 10 mg.  Now the hard part begins. I find that after minimal walking or working in the yard my thighs and upper legs are killing me. Never happened before . If I use a rolling stick it subsides a bit. I've never had this before  I've been an active  cyclist in the warm months. I also swim and kayak.  I'll admit this winter I have not been real active. This has come on in the last few months.  I feel as though I've run 5 miles, as I used to be a runner. Is it the PMR? Is it the deterioration of my muscles? Eileen can you help? 0 likes, 11 replies "

After he realized I won't take it, he pressed on about zoledronic acid, another bisphosphonate.   It's given intravenously once yearly, that way it bypasses the stomach, which can cause alot of the side effects we talk about here.  But, I guess my question is,  more along the long term effects of this drug on the bones; does it really build bones that are going to serve us and keep us from fracturing our hips and ending it all there.

I'm in Canada where our public health system deals very efficiently with major trauma and life-threatening illness, a condition like PMR, not so much. Classic PMR symptoms came on suddenly 4 weeks ago -  bilateral, proximal  pain and stiffness early am, diminishing during the day, CRP the only out of range blood test marker. I've only been told it  appears to be PMR but no definite diagnosis. For some inexplicable reason I haven't been able to get an appointment with a rheumatologist so far. Still hopeful. I was prescribed 20 mg prednisone 21 days ago. I take it with breakfast but suffer pain and discomfort, going from 8-9/10 pain to about 2/10 by around 4-5 hours later. Today was almost unbearable. I stayed up very late last night, feeling pretty good, but then couldn't sleep as the pain on lying down was too severe. I drifted on and off sleep for about 3 hours, sitting up. Trying to get up and moving was near impossible because of severe pain and stiffness. Even walking at a slow painful shuffle was almost impossible as was getting dressed (forget trying to pull on socks). I don't expect diagnostic advice here but I do have a question about dosing from the experience of others. I'm fearful of a repeat of this day tomorrow, so I'm considering taking prednisone this evening at bed time. I have read that there is some wisdom to not taking one dose only in the am, the time when flares are raging. I did try and split my dose once before with no improvement - 10 mg am, 10 mg evening. So I'm thinking of taking 20 mg + 10 mg, not sure which dose when, but I keep reading that ""playing"" with dosing should only be done under the care of a rheumy. However, if I have no appointment date in sight, I would take a chance to deal with the debilitating pain. Can anyone offer any anecdotal experience? Thanks! 0 likes, 5 replies "

I went on a low dose of gabapentin and nortriptyline, which I'm still on (it's about 6 weeks since my rash first appeared). Three weeks ago, my dermatologist gave me steroid shots in the spots where I told him it hurt. He numbed the skin first and his assistant also blew very cold air onto the spot while he gave me the shot. The pain of the shot wasn't too bad, really, even in my armpit. He gave me many shots. It took at least a week to 10 days to feel a reducton of pain in those spots. I returned to him a week ago for more shots in the spots that still hurt. I felt relief more quickly this time, but he also gave me lots more shots than the first time. I have another appt. with him next week. These shots have been a godsend, as I wasn't able to wear a shirt or bra for weeks due to the pain. I'm almost back to normal now. I wouldn't call it pain anymore.

I dont want to swap one thing for another(PHN for pain med addiction) but im so completely lost im in so much pain most of the time that its constantly written on my face i thought i was hiding it well but obviously not well enough. The way my husband and kids and very close friends look at me with sheer helplessness i feel so extremely guilty im trying to hide how bad the pain is but im obviously not doing well enough. Why do they have to suffer ALSO am i not suffering enough for us all. Plz help me does anyone else feel the same?  If so how do u cope? I feel so much guilt. I just need to know that im not alone.

Apparently there are two types of treatment, both a quite serious and require direct infusions and staying in hospital for observation. I have yet to undergo the treatment and I have an appointment scheduled in 2 months at a specialised pain clinic. I have already met with a professor of pain management, who was very encouraging about the potential for a ketamine treatment for me. I am trying not get my hopes up, but after 5 and 1/2 years of pain I am pretty desperate for any treatment that can move me off a daily cocktail of powerful medications. Surprisingly, ketamine treatments are not widely discussed as possible treatments for PHN, despite the numerous successful trials. However, there was some publicity a few weeks ago about ketamine being used to treat  . So if anyone is feeling hopeless and let down by the current course of prescribe medications I would strongly encourage you to ask you doctors and specialists about ketamine treatments.

We have had sex a few times without a condom (dumb. I know.) but we're always extremely careful to prevent an ""accident"" if you know what I mean. Yes, I know the pull-out method isn't ideal and pregnancy is still possible but it's information I should give. She has taken two pregnancy tests from one of those 3 set boxes, with one of them being one of the line thingies and the second one that just says yes or no. We're worried right now because the first one, the line one, had a faint second line, but what confuses us is that the second one said ""NO"". We aren't sure what to think right now. She says she has been getting some kind of pains but I don't really know much. Possibly useful information: she has had a lot of physical health problems, and a lot of stress and  , maybe this is what is causing this. We are both 17. I remember she told me once she would have problems having children because of something but I don't remember what. Also, she got pregnant before (not by me, don't worry) and had a really bad miscarriage, was practically bleeding out.

This blissful expedition of keeping and nurturing a child welcomes different taste swings. Many studies have been conducted to find the actual scientific reason behind such cravings. <a href=""http://www.mybabyfeeding.com/pregnancy/"">Food Cravings During Pregnancy</a> However, until today‚Äôs date, no actual reason has been found out. Today we bring our readers the list of top 10 food and things Women highly Crave for During Pregnancy‚Äù. Spicy Food As mentioned earlier, cravings can peep in at any time in the journey of motherhood. Spicy foods are known to be the most craved for by pregnant women. It was found out that pregnant women are always in a dire need of cooling down. Eating spicy food will make them sweat and thereby, cool them down. In most of the case, it is medically proven to be safe for women to eat spicy food during pregnancy but not in excess. Sweet Chocolate Craving Well, who doesn‚Äôt like to be treated with chocolates? Women, especially during this phase of life, wish to be pampered with the lot and lots of chocolates. Nothing else can be compared to the sense of satisfaction of eating chocolate. Doctor advise Dark Chocolates are best suited for the health of the child and mother. Ice-cream Did anyone just name Ice-creams? It is yet another perfect solution for the sugar-rush cravings. It not only helps in keeping cool but also refreshes the mood of the pregnant woman. Yogurt Ice-creams are best according to specialists. Something Tangy as Pickles We are 100% sure of the fact that taste buds during this journey of motherhood are definitely a thing. Women are found to be craving for something as tangy as the pickle. It is so because it has a unique taste of sweetness but a touch of spice and sourness. Pickles are a healthy pick for craving until consumed in moderate quantity. Red Meat Iron deficiency is one of the most common problems that women go through pregnancy. Hence, there are no second thoughts given to the fact, women crave for red meat during these months. Red Meat is the best for such deficiency and cravings as well. The accurate amount of green vegetables are also advised to be consumed along with the Red Meat. Peanut Butter One of the most comforting foods on our list of cravings is Peanut Butter. Its unique taste can be savored if it is spread over the slice of fresh fruit. Pica Pica is no category of food rather it‚Äôs a non-food substance. This will include different and unique smell such as the lighting of a match-stick, dirt or several others. Potato Chips These Potato Chips can prove to be very tasty and an instant craving solution. Women during their pregnancies crave for them as they are tangy in taste and crunch of course. Lemon and Lemon‚Äôs Tangy Flavor Feelings the constant urge of tasting something as refreshing and tangy as lemon is very common during Pregnancy. 0 likes, 0 replies "

She also referred me to an endocrinologist since I'm having these symptoms but basic thyroid testings showed no symptoms. She said I'll likely be having another MRI to see if the pituitary has stayed enlarged or gotten bigger. Is it possible to have an enlarged pituitary without thyroid problems? Has anyone else experienced this? My thyroid antibodies weren't tested but there is no explanation for the hair loss and other symptoms.¬† 0 likes, 5 replies "
Pilonidal Sinus,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/piondial-abcess-surgery-662193,Piondial Abcess Surgery,"A few months ago i had surgery for a piondial abcess. Id had 3 abcess‚Äôs previous but had managed to drain them at home, never seen a doctor for them as they wernt as severe. This one was horrendous. No sleep, constant hot sweats, crying with the pain. Went to the doctor and they rushed me to general surgery as it was a huge abcess on the verge of bursting under the skin which could have been serious, i was rushed into emergency surgery. I woke up from the surgery in agony, i was dosed up on more   and took the the ward. After a few hours, i stood up to go to the loo, there was blood everywhere. It was spirting out of the dressing and i freaked and passed out. Woke up to being poked and prodded by a consultant and it hurt so bad i made them stop. Gas and air was brought in and i used that while they pulled all the packing out of the wound. I was told id need more surgery as the blood vessels around the wound had burst and i was losing to much blood. Rushed in for another surgery less than 12 hours after the first. Kept in hospital for a few days then went home to rest. Few months later after all the packing, i felt another lump. My first wound still hadnt healed, but i went to the doctors who referred me to a specialist. I see the specialist in 2 days time. The wound has now heald i guess (skin over the wound) but i think there is a tunnel. If i lean on anything, press at the top of where the wound starts, it makes a squelshing noise and clear fluid comes out of a very small pinprick in the skin. Has anyone else had this, where it has healed over the top but theres still a cavity, and what happned? Im too scared of another surgery. Im already freaked as i have a cyst that most likely will need removed, but they wont do that if theyre reopening the wound. Will it need reopened for the cavity? 0 likes, 10 replies "

I also noticed I had very little energy to do anything, and how little emotion I was experiencing. I finally saw a doctor for it, and blood tests were done. Everything was normal, except for my testosterone. It came back a very low 400. I was then sent to do even more blood tests, and they also showed I had high prolactin with the low T. I was then sent for an MRI in search of a tumor, which came back clean. My doctor then made me do one last blood test before prescribing any medication, and it showed a very **slight** elevation in my T, prolactin was still the same. Now, my doctor will not perscribe me any medication and says we‚Äôre in a ‚Äúwait and watch‚Äù period.

I'm also a big hypochondriac. I've taken medication since I was a child. The medication has changed through the years, but for the past 3 years I've consistently been taking, [Invega, Buspirone, Benztropine, Zoloft, and Fluvoxamine]. When I was 18, I went to the ER complaining of visions problems, a loopiness feeling, and some other symptoms. I had it in my head that I had a brain tumor. They did a   as well as an MRI and didn't see anything. I stayed in the mental health unit for a week so they can sort out my medication. Since I was around 15 (I'm 25 now), my body slowly developed breasts that are quite large. I've also gained a lot of weight. I never felt fully developed as a young man because I didn't grow body hair until about 2 years ago. about 3 years ago I noticed that when I squeezed my breast, milk came out. Now 3 years later, milk is coming out of both of my breasts. I done research a couple of years ago on my symptoms and came across a disease called prolactenoma. I'm so sure that I've had this ever since I went to the hospital when I was 18, but they never found it. I went to the doctor this morning and had my blood drawn. My prolactin levels are really high and he made me get more blood work that will come back in a week. I read that almost all prolactin tumors on the pituitary gland are non cancerous. I worry about everything and I'm scared that the tests will come back and say its a cancerous tumor on my pituitary gland. Basically my questions are: If I have had a tumor in my pituitary gland all of these years, if it was cancerous, wouldn't I have known by now, being 7 years later? I'm sure it would have spread by now and I'd probably be dead, that is if it was cancerous. Correct? So that leaves it at a benign tumor right? Which can be easily removed by surgery or even medication to shrink it right?. It's less worrisome if I know that it's not cancerous and can be taken care of. As I mentioned earlier, I'm a big guy. I used to only drink soda and sweet tea. but for the last few months I've only been drinking water. I lost 50 pounds in those months. I can't help but be scared and say that what if I did have  , and that was the reason of my weight loss? I asked the doctor and he said it's because I drank only water and no sugar. I'm just so scared that if it is a tumor, it's cancerous. Also, for the past few months I've noticed it takes me about 10-30 seconds to start urinating. I told him that today, but he just said it's cause of my medication, which doesn't make sense because I've been taking the same medication for years without any problems. I asked what the chances of it being a prostate problem was and he said slim. (Don't forget I'm 25) What could that be? I've also noticed my semen has been really watery the past couple of weeks.

In November of 2018, it was found out that the space that held my gland was enlarged. This led to a MRI which revealed I had a tumor on my gland. After doing 2 rounds of testing with 2 different doctors, I have come out with the diagnosis that my tumor is a secreting tumor with both the cortisol level and the growth hormone. However, it is massive in size at 1.6cm prompting my endo to tell me that I will be having surgery, no matter the hormones , due to the fact it is affecting my vision and causing increased intracranial pressure. So now, I get to face the upcoming surgery date unknown at this present moment with the risk that my gland will be removed due to where the tumor is coming out from (it is sitting in the folds of the front and rear).

I did not realise I am so sensitive to pain. During the operation the first general anesthetic didn't work. During the first packing I was given 3 morphine lolipops and none of them had any effect. I dont know how to face this as I have to go through this procedure at least a dozen more times (the abscess was 10 times larger than average). Does anyone have some advice please? How long can I leave the wick in for before it gets risky? If I can even skip this one today it will be a big help as I still havn't¬† calmed down from yesterday.¬† 0 likes, 2 replies "

As I was changing the gauze the other day I touched the wound and noticed that there is a kind of ""bump"", as if the skin underneath is very hard. It did not hurt to touch it, but then when I took a picture of the wound, i noticed that it is slightly red. So I was wondering if this is just part of the healing process? Should I be worried?

On september 13, 2017 , I sat all day long in front of my desk, studying for 4 exams for the next day. I finished at 1AM and laid down immediately in my bed to get some sleep but I suddenly felt tiny pain at my back. I thought it was only because of too much time i spent sitting and studying. The pain was gone for several days but as soon as vacation started, the pain came back and 2 days later, a bump started to grow in that area. I had it checked at the hospital but I still haven't received the results yet. At first, the bump was felt internally but now, it's already seen outside and it's very painful that I can't even walk wihout waddling, and I haven't laid on my back since the pain started, only laid on my sides. So yesterday, I started taking antibiotics because my parents said so, I thought it would at least have it healed quickly. Yesterday, it started oozing pus, it was very smelly and it was all over my underwear, the smell penetrated through my bedsheets, and I've never smelled this nasty before. Is this a good thing? The pus is more of a yellowish but also brownish when too much comes out. Sometimes, blood comes out too but it's 1/10 of the pus. Until now, it's still leaking pus, so I wore pads inside my underwear to prevent it from spreading nasty odor around my room, my bed, and my clothes. My main concern is, 1. I've been cleaning the pus until now with a toilet paper, is it safe to use toilet paper in cleanig the pus?¬† 2. When will it stop leaking pus? Uni starts in three days, so I'm very worried that I'll be smelly at school, waddling like a penguin because of the pain that the bump gives. 3. As said above, classes will start soon so I don't have much time for operation. Any suggestions to take care of it at home? I will be sharing updates about my """"bump"""" every now and then, maybe, and I would like to hear comments from anyone who would want to help me. : )¬† thank you 0 likes, 4 replies "

My flu only lasted 3 days but it came and went quick and forceful. It was awful.  My regimen is using head and shoulders-deep moisture with Luke warm water. Goats milk soap. I apply coconut oil 2x a day with a mixture of lavender oil, peppermint oil, and tea tree oil after I get out of the shower. The peppermint oil cools it down. I take   when I wake up and go to bed. I take vitamin D, C, calcium/magnesium that has zinc in it. I wanted another option on my skin so I found a local  make-up boutique that sells this amazing lotion line. I'd recommend it, if you can get it. It's my saving grace. CV skinlabs is advanced natural ingredients for burned or wounded treatments. The store swears that it is a staple for   patients. It's a little pricy but I'm willing to try anything! I use the rescue + relief spray. If I have a flare up from irritation from my clothes, when I spray it on the rash it stops itching. This is the only thing I found that gives me relief the longest. They also have a balm that I carry with me everywhere I go. I hydrate with hot water (mostly when I had the flu) and cold water.  I'm so over this! I am hoping I'm at the worst phase and it'll be better soon. They say this is common but I don't know anyone else that had this and they don't know anyone who did either. So reading everyones stories gives me hope. Thank goodness for stumbling on this site. Thanks for taking the time to read my story.  0 likes, 7 replies "
Pityriasis Rosea,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/soooo-tired--26944,Soooo tired!!,"Hi everyone! I was diagnosed with PR last week. I got my 'Mother Patch' on the back of my leg about 5 weeks ago, after being on holiday. I went to the docs and they said it was ringworm and I was prescribed with some cream. About a week and a half after that I started noticing patches on my chest and back which have spread quite rapidly. I also noticed that I have been feeling a lot more tired than usual. I went back to the docs shortly after and they told me I had PR. I had never even heard of it! They gave me a print out of what it was and how long it may last etc. I was horrified to see that there was no cure!!    After reading some of the experiences on here I was slightly relieved to hear that I was not on my own. Although I'm worried about how bad this will get and how long it may last. I'm 26 and work in a school so have just started a new term which has been quite stressful. Plus some other bits and bobs that have happened over the summer which I think will have contributed to my stress levels. This I believe could be linked to my PR. I have some cream to help with any   but I have also started to try Head and Shoulders shampoo as a body wash as described by some other sufferers. I have only been using it for the last couple of days so have not really noticed any major changes yet although my 'Mother patch' seems less red than it has been. I will keep trying! The tiredness seems to be my biggest problem at the mo, although the rash is unsightly!. If anyone has experienced this or has any ideas on how to help this that would be great!

One on my inner upper arm and two on my thigh. They have been very itchy in the past and now they sting and weep. I am wondering if it is because I have scratched them to the point of infection? Like everyone else I am going completely nuts and have tried everything to figure out what this is. The closest thing I came to before discovering PR was a gluten/celiac rash. But the herald patch and it's timing is what seems to set it apart. I recently had surgery to remove my gallbladder and was very stressed leading up to it. The first patch reared it's ugly head about a week before my surgery.  It is difficult to know which symptoms went along with the impending rash because I felt like crap after surgery. thanks for any insight! i am very curious to see what the DR. says with the tests they took.

There are several places you can buy it online now- back when I got it it was on eBay and that was about the only place to find it. I read all these people on here who say things like"" I had it for 6 weeks, then I started this orange juice and garlic with fasting regimen with tanning booth and long cold baths, and after ""just"" three weeks, my PR was gone!""

Why not just start with that instead of spending money on stuff that doesn't work and has no good reviews? I thought it was time to bring that to the attention of this community again.

Let the sun hit ALL the areas where the rash is, especially in the hard to reach areas (I am female and I had this rash all over/under my breasts as well) Drank orange juice every day  Optional: put prescribed steroid cream on rash for itching Hey guys, I never post in forums at all but I remember being desperate for online help as I was going through this, so I thought posting my experience would help others as well. Just for some background, I am female and of medium to dark-tan indian skin tone, and 23 years of age. I wrote it like a story to lighten the mood LOL. Enjoy! I first noticed a harmless little rash on my chest. I ignored it for like 2 weeks until I realized it had gotten bigger. Showed my mom who said it looked like a fungal infection. It looked exactly like ringworm (scaly with raised edges, semi-itchy). So for a week, I put lotrimin on it without any improvement. Then at the end of that week, I woke up with a TON of tiny blotchy raised bumps all over my chest, back, stomach, below stomach, and a little on my legs and arms. None on my face. I started freaking out. But for the next 2-3 days, I kept up with the lotrimin treatment to see if it would go away with time. It got even worse. I freaked out even more. so I researched online about what it could possibly be. I soon realized I had all the symptoms of Pityriasis Rosea, and that my initial ringworm-looking rash was actually the herald patch. I showed my mom how exponentially worse it got and she booked an appointment with a dermatologist right away. Since the appointment was still about 3 days away, and scared that it would get even more worse just in those 3 days, I wanted to waste no time and start doing everything I could to help cure this as soon as possible. I think this was   to clearing it up as fast is I did as I recognized it as PR only 2-3 days after my crazy rash even showed up. After reading a bunch of posts that said to try head & shoulders, I thought it wouldn't hurt to try. I stopped with the lotrimin (it's an anti-fungal, it wont help with PR), and washed my entire body with head & shoulders shampoo twice that day. It made them so itchy and dry afterwards, but i just dealt with it. I did that for the next few days, they kept getting dryer and miraculously, no new bumps showed up. When I went to my dermatologist, it took him literally 3 minutes to diagnose it as PR haha. He prescribed me a steroid cream to help with the itching. That day, having learned more about PR from the doctor, I opened my window in my room and let the sunshine in. UV rays help to clear up the rash apparently. I took off all my clothes and just layed in the sun for about 40 minutes in my room (make sure the window is opened, otherwise I don't think the UV rays will be able to penetrate through the window). I made sure every single bump on my body got a good amount of sun exposure (just a  I am of darker skin tone, and I have read that too much exposure to the sun may leave   dark marks even after the PR goes away. I would be cautious, maybe limit it to 10 - 15 minutes, twice a week if you're apprehensive). The sun seemed to irritate the rash and make them more itchy afterwards, but the next day, I was astonished to see that the rash calmed down significantly. Thrilled with the results, I decided to do another 10 minute sun bathing session the next day. From that day onward, for about a week, I kept up with the head and shoulders routine except toned it down to just once a day as it made my skin super dry. I also drank orange juice every day to help boost my immune system. I only used the prescribed steroid cream about 3 times to help with itching, but even the itching disappeared after a week. The spots seemed calm down so rapidly after that first 40 min session of sun bathing, I think that's what did it. After that day, I had absolutely no new spots. The healing began, the spots became so dry and started peeling, and were no longer raised. I didn't want to put any more creams or oils on top because it felt like the dryness was helping it disappear faster. After a week I was basically completely cured, no new spots, no raised edges, no redness or irritation, and no itching. I was only left with dark marks where the rash had been (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation; this is arguably worse than the actual PR for me and probably caused me more distress lol).¬† Thankfully, the spots have begun to fade even within just a few weeks. I am still trying out different treatments for it (Bio Oil, lemon juice, coconut oil, cocoa butter, exfoliation, fade cream). This part takes some time unfortunately, but feel free to message me if you'd like to hear about my progress with that.¬† PR blows; I know I was probably one of the lucky ones to have a pretty mild case of it.

I stumbled upon this by accident while searching Google for information that can help me. But first, my story: I noticed a red, scaly and dry patch beginning right under my bra line around Christmas. I didn't think much of it at the time -- just thought it was dry skin. After maybe two or three weeks, it didn't go away, so I tried some anti-fungal in case it was ringworm. That did nothing, so I stopped and made a derm appointment for the first week of January. When I went in January, the patch had gotten somewhat better, but was still there. I had no other lesions, so my doctor said it was a patch of eczema and gave me some Cloderm cream to put on it and asked me to schedule another appointment in two weeks if it hadn't disappeared.  In that time, it got better, but didn't go away, so I booked another appointment. I was also having symptoms related to my hypothyroidism, so I made an appointment with my primary for the same day as the derm appointment, just to make it easier to get everything done. This was beginning of February. Two or three days before my appointments, red spots appeared on my chest, neck, arms and abdomen. Not many, but noticeable. My primary diagnosed as tinea versicolor. Derm diagnosed PR, which seemed way more likely. She gave me a prescription for triamcinolone cream, and asked me to come back in a month no matter what. The cream works wonders. Spots I had, including my ""herald patch"" that haunted me since December went away in a week, tops. I was feeling really great. I had a few more spots pop up on my arms and legs, but just kept doing the cream and they have been healing. Fast forward to yesterday -- three days before my derm appointment -- and I have spots all over my back. They don't itch, just are unsightly. I can't actually see them, but my husband has told me they look like the other spots I've had and has helped me apply the cream to them. My rash isn't itchy, just ugly. And I'm just disheartened because this is not at all typical of what I've read online about this rash. My question is -- has anyone had a PR experience like mine? Is it going to keep getting worse still or will I finally start to kick this? Is it normal to finally be getting daughter patches almost two to three months later than the herald patch (my derm says it's obviously possible, but not as common)?

Like most people i read everything on the procedure and was beginning to have¬† doubts.¬† The problem with the net is everyone is always willing to post negative comments and the success stories not so much. I had the procedure on April 15, 2018.¬† I was in the surgery center for only a few hours.¬† I think the procedures took less than 20-25 minutes.¬† I was sent home in a walking boot with crutches. Day 1 - I have a very high tolerance for pain - probably because of the karate.¬† I took one Oxycontin as the gastrocnemius was causing the most pain.¬† the plantar faciitisomy¬†¬†was barely noticeable. Lots of ice and¬†Motrin Day 2 - I took another Oxycontin and lot's of Motrin¬†and icing. Day 3 - 10¬† I stopped the Oxycontin and kept up with the Icing and Motrin.¬†¬†By day 10 I no longer needed both crutches.¬† One was fine.¬† I progressively, as recommended by the Dr, increased the weight on my foot.

Plantar Fasciitis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-plantar-fasciitis-is-getting-worse-35792,My plantar fasciitis is getting worse,"I am a very active and sporty female who has had plantar fasciitis for a month now. It all started with me sitting in a chair and trying to curl my toes upwards when I suddenly felt a stabbing pain in my left heel. At first I thought that it was a cracked heel but was puzzled at how on earth it would have happened with me taking a good care of my feet and doing regular pedicures. And then I immediately thought about plantar fasciitis because I have two friends who have had it. I was waiting for a week for it to go away, hoping that I was wrong but that didn't happened. Went to my doctor who confirmed what I suspected - plantar fasciitis. I was devastated as I love going for long walks, running and doing boot camp style circuits several times per week as well as regular personal training sessions. I work as a housekeeper in a private home, so most of my day is spent being on my feet. This was the worst possible condition I could get! I spent 3 weeks feeling utterly miserable and depressed. Lost my appetite, lost 3kg of my weight and had nightmares about dead bodies. Meanwhile my personal trainer tried to persuade me to see a physiotherapist in a clinic where he used to work. I went there 3 days ago and regained my peace of mind. I am lucky in that respect that I caught it early, I knew what it was right away and stopped running and exercising except for walking. I had a full gait analysis and the results were quite shocking for me. Apparently my lower back muscles are very weak and cannot support my pelvis when I walk or run. Also I have a tight calf muscle (soleus) in my left leg. Both these things combined make me pronate inwards heavily while walking and running. The stress of it was too much for my plantar fascia and it resulted in a mechanical trauma. The physiotherapist was quite optimistic about my recovery and even advised me to continue exercising including running but avoid jumping. I am not sure about running but I am happy that I can continue my daily walks and not worry about causing any further damage to my foot. I will also have to do exercises to strenghen my lower back muscles and release the tension in my left calf. I also did a research about dietary requirements with this condition and herbal remedies. I am against synthetic drugs. Haven't taken anything since I was 17! Apparently, we should eat lots of salmon, sardines and pineapples. Luckily I love all these things and am very well stocked up on them now. From the list of herbal remedies stinging nettles caught my eye. Four years ago I cured my   by placing nettles straight on my back. So, now I am putting them on my foot inside the sock. I am also drinking bucketloads of nettle tea and even soaking my feet in it. It might be just psychological or a placebo effect but all my pain and discomfort is gone. I am not saying that everybody should try it but it certainly helps me. I definitely think that it is worthwhile having your gait analysed. As resting and not exercising alone will not cure the root problem. Unfortunately, this thing is getting worse for me. Been in pain for 4 days, cannot put the heel to the ground, so I am half limping half tiptoeing around at work. Needless to say it's making me depressed and miserable again. I am ready to try anything if it helps! If there is somebody who jas succesfully got rid of this condition, please, please, let me know how you did it!

I am now one year on from having the surgery, like others that I have read about on here, I also have the sharp pains on both sides sometimes. They are normally like a sharp stabbing pain for about 30 seconds and then it goes. (Something to do with nerve damage from the operations I have been told). However, the reason why I am writing on here is that yesterday the dreading air bubble sound in my chest came and I was feeling a bit of pain (exactly like the symptoms from my other pneumothorax's). So, I went down to a and e, had an xray which came back fine. However, I woke up this morning, the pain was slightly worse, and the air bubbling sound is still there. I dont know what to do. I feel silly going back to a and e, like im being paranoid or something? Its the air bubbling sound that really worries me though? Has anyone else had a similar experience after surgery?

It's to the point where I am having trouble with my daily routines.  I can not walk through a store and shop without feeling like I could collapse because my muscles are so exhausted.  This started as episodes in my thigh muscles and spread to be episodes in the muscles all over to even the muscles in my face.   When I speak any louder than my normal voice my vocal chords get exhausted and my voice gets weak and raspy.  When I'm eating something that takes chewing the muscles in my jaw get fatigued.  I have no trouble swallowing thank God.  The episodes at the beginning of this were infrequent and didn't last long, maybe 15 minutes but progressed to happening to each muscle that was used every time it was used and taking much longer to recover. After seeing  a neurologist and having all different tests done for jyst about every muscle disease,  he has come to the conclusion it is the Paxil that is causing all of this.  He told me neurologists don't like Paxil and that I was on too high of a dose, 60mg a day.  He told me to cut down to 20mg a day and prescribed Zoloft to start in 2 weeks or sooner if the withdrawal effects get too bad. Big mistake taking that drastic drop in dosage advice!  The withdrawal effects have been horrible especially on top of how I've been feeling with the extreme muscle fatigue in the first place. Here is a list of my withdrawal symptoms: electric brain squeezing, flu like symptoms which include sweating one minute to freezing the next (I'm on day 17 of lower dose and still feeling hot/cold throughout the day), muscle pain like you get with the flu, stomach pain with semi loose bowel movements, big time   episodes, irritable and overly emotional, trouble sleeping throughout the night and when sleepy because of this during the day I constantly wake up in a panic feeling like I'm on the verge of a severe anxiety attack. I contacted my regular physician to talk about these withdrawal symptoms and what would help ease them and she told me the drop in dosage was too fast and I should not be taking the Zoloft the same time I'm taking the Paxil even at the lower dose.  Yikes, it's hard to know what to do when the two Drs. you are relying on to help you contradict each others medical advice. At this time I am alternating 20mg and 10mg and not taking the Zoloft until I stop the Paxil.  I plan on calling my regular physician tomorrow to find out when to next lower the dose of the Paxil so that I can finally be off of it and find out if it is what has been causing the worsening, all over extreme muscle fatigue. My advice to anyone about to start taking Paxil, don't.  Ask your physician for an anxiety medication with less severe withdrawal symptoms.  Reading these symptoms on a list is nothing compared to actually experiencing them in real life.  I will try a low dose of Zoloft and look into cognitive behavior therapy to help me deal with my anxiety. If anyone else has had these extreme muscle fatigue episodes while on Paxil please let me know.  I'd really like to know if my neurologist is on the right track, I have had extremely low quality of life for the past year and am afraid of it becoming a permanent situation. Thanks for reading!

Penis Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/unique-self-treatment-cured-my-peyronie-s-disease-526065,Unique self treatment cured my Peyronie's disease,"I was diagnosed with Peyronie's in June 2016. It was determined I probably got it a few months earlier by attempting sex without a complete erection, and damaged tissues in my penis. I had hard lumps buried on the top of my penis, (most likely plaque) and what felt like two hardened worms stretching from the base of the shaft to almost the head. Any attempt to achieve erection was not complete and caused great pain. After the Urologist told me there wasn't any proven cure available, I did my own research. I noticed a few people tried Ultrasound, some with good results. Not having such a machine available, I thought I would try something similar, my Sonic toothbrush. I know this sounds weird but please bear with. I placed my thumb under the shaft, and with my fingers, pulled my penis down around the thumb to force the lumps on top to the surface as much as possible. I then took the flat side of the Sonic tooth brush (the opposite side of the brushes) turned it on to the highest vibrations setting, and firmly pressed on the lumps in a circular motion. I did this for about 5 minutes, and also massaged the rest of the top of my penis going from the base to the head with it. I can tell you they almost immediately disappeared, and the pain significantly subsided. I let the little feller rest for a couple days, then did the same treatment, followed by another one a day or so after that. The lumps have disappeared completely. I am thinking the high frequency from the Sonic toothbrush applied to the lumps caused the plaque to break up or dissolve. I then put some Castor oil on the hardened ""worms"" and they have softened back to almost normal. My penis is about 99% back to normal after a week or so of this treatment. My erections are back to normal without pain. I have placed this cure on several pyronie's sites, hoping someone else will try this to see if I am a fluke or if this is truly an easy cure for this horribly disabling disease. I hope this works for all who are suffering with no apparent hope. ¬† 5 likes, 317 replies "

I do not know if this was a physical problem or if it was my   kicking in since the problem was constantly on my mind. After about 5 days of me realizing I had this bump, I applied antiseptic wash on the bump for about 3 days and after I applied the antiseptic wash, the ""stinging sensation"" went away and never came back again. As of now, i feel no pain coming from the bump, I am just curious as to what it is. Again, i dont know if the stinging was actually something physical or mental. The bump has not grown, but at the same time it has not decreased in size. I'm not sure whether its HPV, an STD, STI or something I should not be worried about. I looked at other people who all had the same problem as me & they all said that they we're STD & STI negative. So I am not sure what it is.

It first appeared the day after I used a condom so I think I must have had a reaction to the latex or some other substance in the condom. The tip of the penis became super sensitive and noticeably hurt whenever it touched my underwear. The skin was and still is noticeably red close to and directly around the meatus. This redness gets worse and bigger after I've come out the shower or masturbated. An hour or so after ejaculation, I get a slight burn/irritation at the very end of the urethra when I urinate and this can last for a few days before subsiding. This has put me off from masturbating as much now. This has lasted for about 3 months now with no signs of improvement. I saw a doctor and was prescribed timodine/hydrocortisone cream and this didn't have much effect and am slightly worried it may just make things worse so have stopped using it for now. It almost seems as if the redness comes from within the skin rather than on the surface. I don't think its   as I haven't had that for over 12 years when I was a kid and that was with the usual smegma discharge etc, whereas this is just redness.¬† I've attached images to show how it looks straight after showering, which is when the redness is at its worst and the contrast between the normal skin colour and the redness can be clearly seen. 5 likes, 680 replies "

Penis Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/penile-rash-balanitis-not-responding-to-treatment-683412,Penile Rash/Balanitis Not Responding to Treatment ,"This all began when it started to burn while I urinated. I went to the doctors because I thought it was a UTI, but the test came back negative. Got tested for STD's, the tests also came back negative. Ok no big deal, I thought. Maybe this will go away on its own. I then started developing a rash on the tip of the penis and along the base that burned post urination and during ejaculation. I did some research online and thought it was probably a yeast infection. Bought some Canesten and tried applying it twice a day for a week. I also took the pill (Fluconazole). This resulted in no change in the symptoms. Went back to the doc, who then prescribed Fucidin H cream (Hydrocortisone 1% Fusidic Acid 2%). I rubbed it on twice a day for a week, no change. Went to a Urologist who did an examination (but no further tests) and told me I could get circumcised, but apart from that offered no further solutions. Told me it could be prostatitis. I then went to a Dermatologist, who looked at it and prescribed me Loprox anti-fungal cream with hydrocortisone (1%) told me to use it twice daily on the area for one month. I then switched to just Loprox because it appeared as though hydrocortisone was making the irritation worse. The Dermatologist told me to go see the urologist again if symptons don't improve. I'm still applying Loprox two weeks into treatment, and the changes are minimal if any. The rash goes down at the tip and expands at the base, almost triangular in shape. There are small scales (or maybe cracks) in the skin, and the area is red, almost as if inflamed. I have no discharge from the penis. Any kind of friction (i.e. masturbation) makes the redness and burning much, much worse. I have been abstaining from that for now and only washing the area with warm water. I have thrown out all my heavily scented soaps. I am in the process of attempting to get an appointment with another urologist in order to get a second opinion. Topical creams don't seem to be doing much, but I am going to keep putting Loprox on it for now. I feel like the Docs have been kind of brushing me off/don't want or don't know how to deal with  .

Let me start at the beginning.¬† Nov of 2015, I had a bacterial infection. It started as a little bump on my wrist and it wasn't until late evening (nine?) that I saw a red line going up my right arm. So, I went to the ER. Doctors couldn't say what it was. So, they pumped me full of what the nurse called ""the big guns."" I don't know what antibiotic it was, but that's what he called it. After that appointment, I was prescribed an antibiotic. It was called Clindamycin (also known as Cleocin) and was to be taken every six hours for ten days. I did this. The following health problems ensued. They are divided between cured and uncured. Cured -Extreme weight loss (took prebiotic inulin and probiotics to return to my normal weight) -Chronic   (comfrey oil is your friend; heals in a couple weeks) -Yeast overgrowth (apple cider vinegar) Uncured¬† -Anal muscle spasms. I can feel, when I have to poop, my butt literally trying to stay closed so as to keep the stool from passing - no pain. -Anal leakage. Clear fluid will come out of my anus every morning after I wake up, every time I have a bowel movement, and sporadically during the day. There are some triggers I have identified (drinking a cup of water too fast, eating too much too fast; maybe even exercise such as the exercise bike or mildly bouncing on my mini-trampoline). Otherwise, it seems random. Ruled out C. Diff. Stool test. Magnesium gel on/around my anus helped reduce the amount of leakage 20% - 30%, but it's still there.¬†¬† -Urinary retention/spasms. Literally, my male member will jerk back a few times and then urinate. Even then, it doesn't feel like I totally empty myself all the time. It just doesn't feel like it wants to go. I can feel my butt spazz at the same time, too. -Blood in my semen. Whenever I have wet dreams, they're accompanied by blood. I'm a virgin. These are my symptoms. The doctors I've talked to have suggested a nervous/muscular disorder, but without a solid way to address it. I'm 25. This is a problem for me. ¬† 0 likes, 16 replies "

Pelvic Pain and Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/what-is-an-open-bladder-neck--679996,what is an open bladder neck?,"I have been experiencing bladder problems ever since a catheter was unnecessarily and improperly inserted in me. Unnecessary because only 30 mL of urine came out. I could have been given medication to counteract the medication I was taking at the time to void normally. My bladder was never scanned prior to inserting the catheter and no physical check was done of my bladder or pelvic area for distension. Improper because a very rough nurse just basically jammed the catheter in me without ever sanitizing or lubricating the area first and did not put it in, wait for urine to draw, and then open the balloon as I now know is the proper way to do it. I have been to six urologists to date including the best hospitals that NYC has to offer including NYU, Columbia, and the latest in Mt. Sinai. I went to go see a reconstructive urologist in Mt. Sinai because every other sort of treatment or procedure I have done has failed. I have tried pelvic floor exercises twice, both times using rectal suppositories including external and internal stretching, as the second time I also had pelvic floor injections. I later went on to have botox injected into the pelvic floor as well. I do have pain in all of my pelvic area as well as my rectum and perineum because I contracted an infection from the catheter that was not treated properly and my urination issue has not responded to any of the antibiotics given. I even went to an infectious diseases specialist to take specific strong anti-biotics for this type of infection. I have also taken tons of Flomax, Alfuzosin for a while, many OAB medications including Myrbetriq, Detrol at the max dose, and Oxybutinin. I have also taken Elmiron for six months as a trial for interstitial cystitis. I also went through almost two months of bladder installations with no effect. I tried a two day trial of interstim which failed, however I felt the sensation in my rectum and not in my pelvis as my current doctor says should have been the case. I tried PTNS therapy for almost three months and after all this my urination issue still persists. I can get used to the pain but I cannot function with this constant leaking of small amounts of urine into my urethra out of my bladder into my urethra that causes a constant urge to urinate. It is non-stop from morning till night as I go to sleep with the sensation and it continues after I wake up and urinate in the morning. I had urodynamics testing done and it showed that I was retaining urine as I urinated out almost more than 200 mL of what was put into me. My stream was also quite weak as it is half what it is supposed to be. The doctor I had at the time gave me a ridiculous reason for this suggesting that I might have been shy because the techs were in the room. That is how I urinate normally as I have hesitancy even in the morning when I have a full bladder of urine built up from sleeping the whole night. I take medication for sleep or else I would be up the whole night urinating. The reconstructive urologist is going to run videourodynamics to see how my bladder neck and both urinary sphincter muscles are working more accurately. He said that I could have an open bladder neck and the treatment option would be to tighten the bladder neck. All that I can find from my searches on google is something called bladder neck obstruction and a lot of my symptoms match that diagnosis. However I see that the treatment for this is to open up the bladder neck and not tighten it. I am really confused at this point. I am starting to get pretty hopeless and desperate at this point for them to relieve me at least somewhat of this situation because my whole life revolves around the toilet. I can urinate literally hundreds of times a day. I do not have any strictures in my urethra which was seen on a regular cystoscopy. Also, I do not know if any medications will affect the test as I currently take large doses of a muscle relaxant called Flexeril and Flomax two times a day. I have to call the office prior to the test and see what I can and cannot take and for how long. My thinking is that the Foley catheter balloon was opened up in my bladder neck area and stretched out my bladder neck as it has never been able to recover. When the catheter was taken out I felt a sharp pain at the base of my penis and for one to two weeks after I had a very hard time urinating as it was coming out very dark and in small amounts with a lot of straining. One morning I woke up and started urinating non-stop. Since then I have gotten to the point of being able to hold it for hours but that sensation of having to go is always there. Can anyone give me some information to read about what can go wrong with the bladder neck. I know that catheters can cause bladder damage, but the urologist did not seem to think this was possible. He doesn't know if a surgery would really help me? Can anyone offer me any insight into this situation? Has anyone experienced anything similar and had relief from anything? 0 likes, 0 replies "

I am begging  for any help, ideas, suggestions in solving, or at least some u understanding on what's going on with me. Spare with me I am going to try and keep this short as possible but want to provide as much info as possible. Brief history, at 6 years old I was diagnosed with per perthese leg calves disease.  I used crutches and wore leg braces which resolved the issue. I walked with a slight limp most of my life.  By my late teens to early 20s I experienced chronic pain in low back and arthritic pain in and around my right hip, which was to be expected. I am now 34 years old, married and two kids. Long story short, 3 years ago the pain became intolerable.  after MRI and xray on back and hip it was determined I needed my hip replaced. pre surgery I was unable to work and in a lot of pain but it wasn't the end of the world. I had THR of right hip 2016.  Post OP I  was not healing as expected and surgeon was stumped.  Only thing my wife and I noticed was post OP x-ray showed a screw going away from hip joint and exiting pelves in what appeared to be the buttock area.  we were told not to worry about it but surgeon had no idea. I was unable to return to work and benefits ran out so I lost my job.  in March 2017, primary care physician diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.   Med after med was tried with no positive results. MRI on back, both pre. and post OP,  shows slight bulge in one of the discs but nothing that would be causing the pain I'm in. I've had bone scan on hip to check joint and ct scan of pelvis.  had nerve testing done twice, first showed chance of nerve damage in leg. 2nd nerve testing did not show any issues.  a shot was done around the random.screw and I recieved 15 percent relief for about a week.  this resulted in a revision surgery, by diff surgeon,  to remove screw and check hardware.  I am now 2 months post OP of the revision surgery and am back to same old problems and pain. I am.currently going to PT, who is the one who recommended I each out to a forum such as this. The PT's latest following is list of symptoms I have been experiencing throughout the last 3 years.  I understand not all symptoms are for sure related but listing all in hopes someone can relate, offer treatment ideas, meds or even a possible diagnosis. Low back pain, just above buttocks accompanied by a good size knot on both sides of back Shooting pain from back down legs.  was less severe and only down right side pre THR. now down both legs with right more severe. Pain in buttock and ham strings and also on inside of leg.  specifically just below right buttock mlre towards inside of leg going to inside if the knee Muscle spasms in back and legs with legs and buttocks being worse. sometimes so severe the whole bed shakes Legs have always been extremely tight but post THR I cannot touch my right foot even to out on a sock. Arms and legs fall asleep easily and I experience severe tingling in buttock and hamstrings specifically when laying down Bottom of feeti getting burning sensation as if a flame is being held to them, again specifically when laying down Low energy, smallest physical activity will drain me.  the more I do the more I will suffer Off and on migraines Pain that radiates from right hip into mid pelvic region and groin. also claims up side above hip to the bottom of rib cage Swelling along entire right buttock hip side and back Extreme sweating even without physical exertion.  but when  being physical, meaning folding laundry, sweat will put from head Dry scaly skin around ankles and elbows Low to no appetite Stomach will cramp and diarrhea when back pain is at its worse I have tried cymbalta, lyrica, gabapentin,  multiple muscle relaxers and other anti inflammatory medications.  None of the meds have helped and some have had negative results I am currently going to PT where I have had dry needling done and laser treatment. both made pain worse. only relief i get is from marijuana and massages, both temporary. PT is the one who recommended I reach out and see if someone has had similar experience or symptoms. PT did mention Complex regional pain syndrome.  I have appt next month with primary care to see what's next. sorry for length of this but as I said imam desperate for anything that helps.  I no longer have any hope I will get back to even my normal, pre THR, chronic pain. I only hope I can find some relief so I can enjoy at least some part of this life. Thanks, Jake 0 likes, 1 reply "

I'd answer ""I don't know"". I honestly don't. Whenever I would answer these questions what I am feeling in such an abstract way in 3 countries in the emergency room, I would not be considered serious. In the Netherlands I was asked few times if I was really in pain if I can't describe it and in the United States I was told that I shouldn't even bother going to the urgent care if I have a chronic pain, there is nothing that can be done. After all these tests, numerous doctors and insane amount of disappointments I was told that I have a chronic pelvic pain. That means that my constant state of pelvic muscles is tense, meaning there is no way of having a sexual intercourse, at least for the moment.

I tried everything.. meds, PT, botox injections and few days ago I was told by a doctor that nothing can be done for me. Nothing. I am 32 and pain should be the part of my life. I'm struggling so much to accept it and I am wondering if there is anyone dealing with a similar issue and if there is anything that can be helpful. Actually, the only thing I am looking for is hope.

I've just turned 40, am married, and severely depressed after nearly 8 years of chronic spinal/disc pain. I had a PLIF (L4/L5 & L5/S1) in 2014 at the Princess Alexandra, Harlow. After 2 years of agony on my part and a lot of shrugging of shoulders on theirs (followed by a ""we can't help you. That's it"" ). We finally discover through the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore , that my fusion has completely failed and I have Baastrups at L4/L5. I was gutted and angry that something so obvious has been missed, but also vindicated that it wasn't just hypersensitivity as I kept being told by the local pain clinic. I was   that it was something mechanically wrong, and I was right. After much wrangling with the Stanmore , who refused to revise my failed fusion and collapsed vertebrae. I went privately to one of their ex Senior Surgeons. One year on and the scans show a nicely fused spine (the screws were starting to fall out previously). Yet I am STILL in agony because it transpires that my SI joints are degenerating badly. I can barely do a thing without it causing pain in my SI joints, and my groin and inner thighs. It's like red hot knitting needles or knives in my back or it feels as though someone is trying to forcibly pull my leg off. The pain is worse at night and on movement which involves opening / stretching my legs (even going to the toilet). Any pressure from something (even my 8yr Daughter cuddling up to me), tight clothing like jeans, seat belts, being a passenger in a car (bump by roads and sudden braking are a killer). The worst though is sitting . I cannot sit on an ordinary chair for more than 10 minutes without needing opioids (40mls Oramorph ) or if really bad 100-200mg buccal Fentanyl . So now I am terrified of doing anything! So I stay in bed laying on 4 visco elastic pillows to help the pressure and I am practically always knocked out on Opioids . I barely see my Husband, and I have missed out on everything with my Daughter. It breaks my heart and I don't know what to do. My DH lost his Mum a few weeks ago and he really needs my support, but I'm just out of it. I came off all the meds this time last year by myself (800mg Fentanyl , 600mg Zomorph, and around 400mg Oramorph a day) . I had to wean myself off using 30/500mg codeine that my Mum gave me. I had no help from my GP, who firstly advised go cold turkey (! !) then confessed she was totally out of her depth. In the end I got off all the Opioids, but absolutely could not cope with the pain! ! ! So what's the point in doing it over again? ? I don't know what to do. I know about SI injections, nerve ablation etc , but the Stanmore pain clinic seems to be convinced I just need to get off the drugs and increase my fitness (physio sessions left me in tears) . I just don't trust anyone! I ended up with PTSD last time and came scarily close to an opioid OD, and had no real support from the MH 'Crisis' team. But I don't want my life to exist of nothing but pain, crying, drugs, sedation and finally sleep. When I wake , I am usually weak, exhausted, groggy, and feel emotionally drained. The pain just takes the enjoyment out of everything I once loved. I dread going anywhere or doing anything . So now I've pretty much become a recluse. A useless Mother and Wife in name only. Only leaving this dark room for essential hospital appointments, which my carer takes me to. I seriously feel that it would be best for all concerned if I ended everything. Thank you for reading.

Pelvic Pain and Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/should-i-visit-the-er--693647,Should I visit the ER?,"Hi! I'm a 27 year old female with PCOS. For the past two weeks I've been experiencing very concerning pelvic pain.When it first began, it was specific to the left side of my pelvis and presented as a consistent throbbing pain. Due to PCOS, and also having a Mirena IUD I shrugged it off as just some random cramping because I definitely experience that often. I was able to control the pain with Ibuprofen so I just went about life as normal. After a couple days I noticed the pain getting more severe and radiating into my lower back on the same side. Ibuprofen was no longer really helping, nor was a heating pad. The pain has continued to morph into a very sharp stabbing pain, and now I've noticed that the pain spans my entire pelvic area. With extreme tenderness when I press my fingers above my pubic area. The back pain has also spread to cover my entire lower back. I am absolutely doubled over in pain. I have a history of ovarian cysts, and it didn't feel half as painful as what's happening now. Those past cysts resolved themselves. My main concern is that I now have a cyst large enough to cause more problems than in the past, and I've scared myself a bit reading about how large cysts can twist the ovary. I also have considered the possibility that my IUD may have slipped out of place and is causing pain. I felt for my strings and everything feels normal. I called to schedule an appointment with my PCP, who isn't able to see me for two weeks despite letting them know how severe my pain is. I also contacted Planned Parenthood but due to my issue I had to schedule something rather than just do a walk-in and they can't see me for a week. I don't have access to any other urgent services except the ER right now. I just want some input on whether this is something I should wait a week to have checked out or if it warrants an ER trip? I'm very anxious about the pain continuing to increase, and it's certainly beyond uncomfortable at this point but I also don't want to take up ER resources, or spend many hours waiting for care if it was something that could have waited. Not having any abnormal bleeding or discharge. I do feel the sensation of pressure in my lower abdomen and pelvis. I'm having pain with urination but it's not urethra pain. It causes me to feel an especially sharp pain in my uterus area. I just don't want to overreact, or suffer any consequences from underrreacting!

I'm fatigued even though I sleep upwards of 10 hours a day. I had a clean ct and upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound (no pelvic ultrasound) and lots of blood work.

Pernicious Anaemia,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/low-normal-b12-im-shots-and-ongoing-symptoms-693915,"Low/normal B12, IM shots, and ongoing symptoms","Hi, I'm sure my questions have already been asked so I apologise in advance. In early 2018, after almost 2 years of increasing symptoms such as brain fog, fatigue, interrupted sleep, decreased sense of smell and taste, and burning feet accompanied with a sensation of wearing stockings to the knee and long gloves, I was told my B12 serum levels were 220 pmol/L and B12 active levels 41 pmol/L. My GP is proactive and commenced 1000 mcg IM methyl shots immediately with a schedule of 1 shot every 3  weeks for 9 weeks; then once a month. 4-5 months after my first shot I felt no real improvement had occurred and asked to have shots every 2 weeks, which my GP agreed to.  This continued for appx 6 weeks when I got sick of attending the surgery and requested they show me how to administer the shots myself, which they did. Thankfully I'm in Australia so can purchase ampules over the counter at a chemist, and can get free injecting equipment through a health organisation. I self administered every 10 days for 8 weeks. By then my B12 levels were well over 1000 pmol/L and have remained there. I subsequently stopped having the shots as I appear to be maintaining levels adequately. I was also taking 5000mcg of Methyl B12 sublingual tabs daily along with a B complex, fish oil, zinc and joint pain supplements (dodgy knees). I continue to supplement regularly although not to such high levels. In April 2018 I asked my doctor to review previous blood tests to check whether my B12  had ever been tested before as my symptoms had progressed considerably - it turns out it had been in Dec 2016 when I first went to get my issue of numb toes checked out. My levels back then were 198 pmol/L and 39 pmol/L for serum and active forms respectively. These results were never followed up by my GP at the time and I was completely unaware of them until April 2018 . At the time they had concerns it may have been MS as my sister suffers from the disease. I have also had my children tested as I was concerned that this may have been a dietary issue.  My youngest two tested in the low to mid 300's. I supplement them occasionally as a result as there is a chance they're not getting enough from their food. Over the last 3-4 weeks I've noticed a significant return of the burning feet and stockinged legs/arms sensation, particularly of a night time. I live in a tropical area of Australia and have noticed this seems to occur when the weather heats up. The brain fog is almost non-existent and my sleeping patterns have improved significantly. My memory however still has some gaping holes in it and I continue to struggle with retention of  information. I've also recently discovered I'm massively deficient in Vit D, which surprised me as I live in a place with almost constant sunshine (not as great as it sounds I might add!). It seems the Slip/Slop/Slap skin cancer campaigns have really paid off and we are a nation of increasingly Vit D deficient people. I have had 2 MRI's that were clear of MS, stroke, tumour, any form of demyelation disorder, spinal cord compression, and cauda equina. I saw two different neuro's who tried to convince me it was anxiety and wanted to treat me with anti depressants and then suggested I visit a psychologist. I went to see a psychologist who rejected the anxiety theory (as had I) but they suggested it could be fibromyalgia. My GP rejected this suggestion and frankly I'm dubious myself. I've had STI checks; urine protein checks; autoimmune checks for lupus, Sjogren syndrome, RA etc; diabetes; iron studies; MMA (after supplementation unfortunately); thyroid function; coeliac disease; intrinsic factor and routine bloods/chemistry checks. With the exception of a slightly abnormal liver function (ALT) test, all have been clear and normal. I'm not pre-menopausal. I am visiting my Dr again soon for follow up tests to check B12 & Vit D levels. I'm now also seriously considering environmental factors such as adult onset allergies, or some sort of contamination. The last I doubt is an issue as my children don't appear to be affected. So finally to my question(s) -  from the past experience of other B12 low/deficient patients: Hopefully someone is still reading this.... Many thanks in advance! 0 likes, 2 replies "

Pernicious Anaemia,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/pernicious-anemia-and-b12-deficiency-help-692029,Pernicious anemia and b12 deficiency help ,"I‚Äôm looking for some advice on pernicious anemia and vitamin b12 deficiency. I am a 28 year old female. About 2 years ago I went to the doctors with a cut on the corner of my mouth, they prescribed me antibiotic creams and thrush creams but it didn‚Äôt clear so they took my bloods and the results came back as slightly low in b12 and iron so they prescribed me some vitamins which I took but they didn‚Äôt really make much difference. After this I just left it and didn‚Äôt go back to the doctors but started noticing more symptoms. I have pins and needles in my hands and feet which are always cold, very dry skin on my face, an extremely itchy and flaky scalp, hair loss, hair seems to be greying quite rapidly, angular chellitis that comes for a few month then clears and then comes back again, a constant sore tongue, sometimes get a numb tingling sensation in tongue, burning sensation on skin on legs, flaky fingernails with vertical ridges, long spells of   followed by  , spells of tiredness, low mood but I suffer sever mental health issues so this is normal for me. A couple of weeks ago I mention it to the doctor that symptoms hadn‚Äôt cleared and seemed to have worsened so they took my bloods again but this time the results have come back all clear and no further action needs to be taken yet I am left with all these symptoms... I am very confused. these are the test that my doctor requested: CRP, full blood count, ferritin (CO_VIT=No), hba1c, liver profile, magnesium (MG2+), renal profile, throid function test (CO_PITF=No (CL_TME=0)) would these tests pick up low b12 or PA. Should I request to have my bloods redone or are there particular tests that I need to request? I‚Äôm certain that I have some sort of b12 deficiency related illness. Any advice would be appreciated!

I have two doses left on loading but i cant take any time off after them. one is on tuesday im working 16 hour days wed and thursday. im expecting to feel even worse with each dose. im unsure if its my immune system playing havoc or im generally reacting to the actual b12.

Palsy - Non Cerebral,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/bell-s-palsy-migraine-symptoms-affecting-body-653811,Bell's palsy & migraine? Symptoms affecting body,"Hi. I apologise in advance if this is long...  Two weeks ago I started to get a tingling sensation in my mouth on the right side, didn't think much of it but the next morning woke up and the right side of my face between my upper lip and eye was tingly and numb. My face looks normal overall, my  right eye doesn't blink and  you can see my mouth doesn't move properly if you really look but otherwise can't tell so left it for a few hours.  I'd also had a   on that side for a few days also at the back (top of my neck/bottom of my head).  Eventually called 111 (mainly because I'd previously had a DVT and   - caused by being on the pill, I was 31/32 at the time - so thought might be linked) and was admitted to the stroke unit as upon testing me they found my arm and leg were also weak, which I hadn't really noticed but could tell they were when they were doing the tests. I was also getting double vision and dizziness, and feeling like the room was spinning when I would close my eyes.  Had a CT scan which showed no bleed, also had an MRI which showed a small lesion on the left frontal lobe but was told this wouldn't cause what I was having so not to worry about it. Was eventually seen by a neurologist at around 11pm on the ward and he diagnosed Bell's palsy. I asked about the arm and leg weakness and he said they didn't seem weak anymore so could have been a migraine (never had one before). I was put on 60mg steroids for 5 days, with tapering off for a further 5 days.  I still have double vision, it comes and goes but I get it several times every day, also had spots in my vision a couple of times and a feeling like there is 'cloudiness' or blurriness, like I'm looking at things through a filter on my right eye. Got new tingling in my mouth and in my bottom lip and lower jaw starting on two days after I commenced steroids, has come and gone in severity (had it all day this Weds for example) along with intermittent numbness. Have also had tingling around my groin area on the right, and expericenced some very strange sensations of feeling kind of floaty when I was lying down, also felt my abdomen was tensing.  Called hospital and was asked to go in to see the on-call doctor, he seemed sceptical of Bell's palsy as he did the movement tests again and said my arm still felt weak (leg less so but was slightly weaker than left side - this was 12 days after initial symptoms, last day of steroids). He prescribed more steroids as a precaution, 40mg for 5 days, and said to attend my gp to get an urgent outpatient referral with neurology, however I already have one booked for this coming Wednesday and so cannot get in any sooner.  One more thing that may be totally unrelated, I did have a very intense pain in my eye on the left side (opposite side to my current symptoms, but same side as the lesion) for 4 days in the week leading up to this all happening. The neurologist did ask if I had had any eye pain and I said no as was only thinking of the right side but realised the next morning I maybe should have mentioned it.  Just wanted to know really if anyone else had experienced the same and whether this is normal, as none of the doctors I have spoken to have been able to say whether it is or not? I haven't really had much actual pain, which I would have assumed I would if the body symptoms are caused by migraine?  Thanks  0 likes, 2 replies "

Pancreatitis and Pancreatic Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/accuracy-of-ct-scan-691849,Accuracy of CT Scan,"Hi, I'm interested to know if anyone knows how accurate a   is to detect  ? The doctor requested a ct scan with pancreatic protocol, I don't know exactly what that means, all it says on the radiologists report is 'multiple phase ct pancreas including non-contrast, post contrast during portal venous, arterial and delayed phases'. The scan came back clear. I would like to know how certain the above is in ruling out pancreatic cancer. A bit of background.... I am a 41 year old male. I consider myself to be fairly healthy, I like to eat relatively healthy, enjoy exercise and rarely drink alcohol. I am 180cm tall and weigh around 74kgs. About 4 months ago I started to experience a vague pain that moved around my lower abdomen, this pain is now predominately in my lower right abdomen (to the right of the belly button) and sometimes in my right hand side. It is not constantly there, it comes and goes. About two months ago I developed a dull pain/ache deep in my upper back, below my in right shoulder blade, again this is not there constantly, it comes and goes. I have had muscle pain in my back before from over exerting myself in sport or lifting a heavy object, this is different to that type of pain, no as intense. During the past 4 months, I have had various other symptoms.... Episodes of light headiness and dizziness. A racing heart/heart palpitations. An indigestion type feeling the indigestion feeling isn't a heartburn type feel, but more of a feeling that something is stuck in my throat that is ready to come up back up (but doesn't), I have been getting a mild feeling of nausea with this as well. I went through a period of a few weeks where I was belching excessively immediately after eating (this had now subsided, though has come back more mildly on a few occasions) Periods of fatigue. I am normally an active 'get up and go' kind of guy, though I started to feel very lethargic and unmotivated. Instances of getting a bad chemical taste in my mouth, I also noticed that when drinking beer it tasted disgusting and not at all as it normally does. Tongue Sores My belly constantly pulses up and down, which is especially noticeable when sitting or lying down. I have been told this is completely normal though it's something I have never experienced before. I also know that I'm not overweight though I certainly have belly fat. Changes to my normal bowel habits. I have had blood tests, a colonoscopy and endoscopy and nothing untoward has showed up. I appreciate that I have had a lot of testing, which has come back clear, though I also know that PC is not always picked up from CT scans and that sometimes it is missed or that alternative testing is required. I'm not saying I'm convinced I have PC, though it certainly has been a worry for me. I would just like to know how confidently it could be ruled out. Thank you 0 likes, 1 reply "

I always had a very flat nice stomach. I blamed my desk job, long commute, and bad eating habits. Living in NYC, I basically subsisted on takeout. I had other weird symptoms though like muscle weakness starting in my thighs and arms, back pain too. Sometimes I was in pain for weeks then it would just go away. I thought maybe it was the way I was sleeping weird or something. I started developing aura migraines and everyday general headaches as well. Pain and pressure behind the eyes, like eye strain.

I was always around 110-115 lbs but now was around 125 lbs, so not a crazy amount but my body just looked different. It was all flab, no muscle, jiggly weird cellulite covered belly. I tried losing it but couldn‚Äôt. I blamed myself again and not working out enough. I started getting hot flashes and my face would flush. I always had rosy cheeks and was told I had rosacea so that isn‚Äôt anything new but the flushing was. I also started getting night sweats and sleep disturbances once in a while. I would have no issue falling asleep, but would instantly enter REM stage and dream but wake up every hour or two all night long. Then it would just go away and I‚Äôd sleep like normal.¬† I started losing my sex drive and blamed my appearance on it and depression. My moods started going crazy. I started having rage episodes, mood swings, severe crippling anxiety (like becoming agoraphobic anxiety), paranoia, depression. My body felt so weak and heavy in my limbs, I just kept blaming depression.¬† In 2016 same symptoms but all intensified. I noticed I think around this time that my hair was thinning, however a coworker passed away and I assumed it was telogen effluvium from stress. As my moods continued to go haywire, I started noticing my skin and face just seemed different. I was bruising very easily, my face looked puffier but not like full on moon face. My skin all over seemed like it was losing collagen, just thin and crepey. Still had zero motivation and weak muscles. Felt horrible all year and became convinced I was entering some type of early perimenopause.¬† In 2017 things continued to worsen. Sleep disturbances happened on a regular basis, headaches, zero sex drive, mood issues, horrific anger outbursts, digestive issues, hair loss, severe depression, muscle weakness, no energy. I knew something was wrong with my hormones because things were going well in my life aside from all these weird health issues and I went to see my gyno to have hormones tested. This is after two years telling my gp that I wasn‚Äôt well to only be written off as crazy or having fibromyalgia.¬† My hormones were checked for run of the mill female hormones, fsh, LH, prolactin, etc. my total testosterone was mildly high and my prolactin was high.

I explained all my issues and was told I needed psychiatric help, antidepressants, to stop stressing, and my hair was not balding. I left p****d off.

All my symptoms exploded. I‚Äôve had sleep disturbances since, I do not sleep anymore and if I do I‚Äôm tense and dreaming. I wake up after what seems like hours and it‚Äôs been 20 minutes. I started becoming   end of feb. And spent so much money on cabs because if I went down to the subway I was scared I would jump. In March I couldn‚Äôt even have strength to carry groceries. I developed a week long massive headache and afterwards my hair started falling out in clumps. It is official now, I am balding. It started with just my sides then the temples. Now it‚Äôs diffuse and I lost well over half my hair, weeellllll over. I put extensions in and it is not helping anymore. Just the last week, I lost so much hair. Like 400 strands a day. My hair is gone.¬† At this point I was already seeing an endo for the prolactin. She did an MRI of my pituitary and it was unremarkable. My total testosterone came back high but my free T always normal and my sex hormone binding globulin was high, at one point off the range high. She thought I was on birth control but I wasn‚Äôt. TSH normal, thyroid antibodies normal, Free T3 normal. I asked her to test cortisol and she said I didn‚Äôt look cushingnoid but it does take years to take on the appearance so she did an am blood test. My result was 21.6 with top range being 22. She had me do a 24 hour urine and the result was 48.something with top being 50.¬† I started developing in April long vellus hair all over my body and face. Like, all over. My forehead, cheeks, back, breasts, thighs, stomach. I was always pretty hairless my whole life. This is freaking me out. I was diagnosed with insulin resistance and pre-diabetes. My blood pressure was up a bit when I usually have low. The other odd thing is that now I am dropping weight like crazy. I‚Äôm only 103 lbs now and I have nooo muscle left on me but still have a flabby fat belly. My bones hurt even sitting on a cushion. There‚Äôs no muscle.¬† I‚Äôve seen REs who told me I had pcos. Had cystic ovaries and then didn‚Äôt on a second scan. Had one endo take back their pcos diagnosis, tell me I‚Äôm just crazy and that I have an eating disorder. I don‚Äôt.¬† I had my gp test my am cortisol again and it was almost 50 with top range being 22. Was told it was stress. My CBC had high red blood cells, high hemoglobin, and hematocrit. Low lymphocytes and high neutrophils. Saw a hematologist who said high neutrophils could be from high cortisol. He didn‚Äôt believe I had pcos. Thought stress. ¬† Most of my endos and drs washed their hands of me but I am not well! I did have a ct scan too of my adrenals Bc my DHEA-S shot up so I demanded one. Adrenals were fine but they found a benign tumor on my kidney and a cyst on my liver.¬† I‚Äôm balding, growing weird long vellus hair all over, weak, not sleeping, mood issues, anxious, falling apart. I haven‚Äôt been to work since April. I can no longer function. My boss recommended this pituitary and adrenal specialist and I faxed all my labs to herald was told she‚Äôd review and let me know if she wants to see me. I found out the other day that she wants to see me and is having me take all the cushing‚Äôs tests.¬† I‚Äôm so scared this is like an ectopic tumor and is cancer. Why am I losing weight when I couldn‚Äôt budge it before? My hair is gone. I‚Äôm so depressed. I had very thick hair even when it was thinning, it was thick. There‚Äôs nothing left. I feel so sick all the time. I used to be an active person who had dreams and desires in life. I‚Äôm just a husk of what I used to be. My life is in shambles and I don‚Äôt understand why no one helped me years ago. No one listened. My family all see it now and are doing everything they can to help.¬† I know this is not pcos. I have normal menstrual cycles and did for 20 years. Never had any signs of pcos. I have so many signs of high cortisol and cushings. The only difference is now I‚Äôm thin, flabby but thin. I was working with a trainer too who thought this seemed weird. I was dropping weight but body fat was going up so I was losing muscle even though I was weight lifting. I had to stop because in May I became too weak.¬† I want this nightmare to end. I also developed dry flaky skin and my cuts are not healing well. I actually got my ear pierced and have had 8 piercings with never an infection. Tattoos with zero infection. After my unremarkable ct scan I thought I‚Äôd go get my ear pierced because maybe I am nuts. Maybe the drs are right and I am losing my mind and it‚Äôs pcos. I was worried it wouldn‚Äôt heal but did it. Was fine for a couple weeks then I developed perichondritis I think it‚Äôs called or cellulitis. Had to go to the ER twice in the same night. Was told to take two different antibiotics and if it didn‚Äôt get better I needed to be admitted. My body is not the same. I‚Äôm scared. I want my life back and my hair. I‚Äôm so scared and depressed. I do t wang to die from cancer either. I just want help and answers. This can‚Äôt be normal. I know I used to feel healthy and energetic and was not balding and did not have weird mood issues and sleep issues.¬† Thank you for reading if you did. Anyone have any advice? Am I crazy? Is this pcos? Every pcos forum I joined, I feel rejected from. No one connects with my symptoms.¬† 0 likes, 2 replies "

Other pointers suggested Cushings but because of the variations in BP and Cotisol the Endos thought it was secondary Cushings which I had never heard of I was told that having repeated courses of prednisone isnt helping (8 in the last 16 months) and that if this were to carry on im at severe risk of developing Addisons within 5 years.¬† I just feel so confused right now.

I understand it needs to be ruled out with mild elevations and since I lost weight recently they don‚Äôt think I look cushingnoid enough.

A lot of my physical symptoms didn‚Äôt seem to concern here but it‚Äôs my body and I know all these changes are new and very wrong.¬† One of the first signs that I picked up on that something was wrong years ago was, aside from body comp changes, my mental well-being. I just developed weird mood issues, uncontrollable intense anxiety, anger issues, depression, etc. I can‚Äôt cope with any stress now, little or big.¬† I have been having many symptoms of cushings for years that I blamed myself for (job stress, loneliness, long commute, poor self esteem, laziness, etc.). I had body composition changes, weight gain of 35 lbs although I recently lost after cutting sugar and carbs but my loss is weird. My stomach is still flabby and fat but everywhere is skinny. I used to be pear shaped with a perfect flat stomach when I was my old self. I had a puffy round face that went away with weight loss but when I compare pics from my past I can see my face was not puffy looking at higher weights and at lower weights I had a puffy face. Makes no sense. I have worsening rosacea, bad muscle weakness and fatigue, hair loss, major sleep disturbances and insomnia, migraines, easy bruising and thin skin, severe mood and emotional issues. It really exploded this past March. I started losing hair more rapidly and all over my head, all the vellus hair on my body and face grew crazy long and I used to be a hairless person. I even have long vellus hairs on my eyelids now. I‚Äôm getting episodes of rapid heart rate for no reason, dx with prediabetes, insulin resistance, developed hypertension, high cholesterol, have had weird skin infections (cellulitis). I used to be so healthy, never ever had an infection like that before and I‚Äôve had tattoos and piercings that I could have cleaned better during the healing process but no issues. Can psuedo cushings really cause my issues? I feel trapped in a nightmare. Before it became apparent that everything that was happening to me was NOT my fault, I would ask my family if my face looks different, I would cry to my mom that I‚Äôm not myself anymore and I want to be old Gina. In 2016 I had a painful small hump between my shoulders that I took photos of, I blamed my deskjob but that‚Äôs when I read about cushings and suspected I had it. I remember checking every girl‚Äôs back on the subway to work to see if they had it too.

I was feeling so poorly last week that I went to the ER on Tuesday (it was too long of a drive to go back to Mayo). They did some tests, gave me a 100 mg shot of   and 3 day rx for more pain medication.  This helped... and I felt a better until Friday. Once again out of pain medication. I tried to rest, take Advil , Tylenol & hot showers. By 2a.m. On Saturday, I was so miserable that I went back ¬†to the ER. ¬†They did some lab work ,   and everything came back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. ¬†So home again with another 3 day rx of pain medication. ¬†Then last night , I took a pain pill at about 11:30 and went to bed. Woke up at 3a.m feeling awful. ¬†Pain on my side and mid-back, flushed,  , nauseous, chills and felt very weak and lightheaded. I live by myself so this was kind of scary ... I tried to calm myself down and took another pain pill. Laid back down until 6:30-7 - when I woke up feeling even worse. I called 911 and was taken to the ER by ambulance. ¬†They gave me IV fluids , medication for nausea, more pain medication, labs and another CT scan.

First off apologies for what might seem like a long post however I've had a few health issues which have been with me for about 18 months now and I dont seem to be any closer to getting a diagnosis as I was when this first started. I'm after help and advice as I seem to be stuck now and i'm all out of ideas. About 18 months ago I was taking a long drive on holiday (about an 8 hour drive) - during the journey myself, partner and children were taking regular breaks and making sure we had plenty of food and drink on the way. When we eventually pulled up for some reason I was feeling really weak, and felt like if I got out of the car I would pass out quite quickly. The feeling I got was that feeling when your really hungry and really tired, perhaps low on blood sugar. I some how managed to survive this ordeal and for the duration of our holiday I kept having spells like this. There were two quite intense occasions during the week we were there where I felt like this. I had to get some food in me and it perked me up. The final day we were there we stopped off at a tourist attraction and I spent the entire 2 hours in a public toilet as I was struggling to not pass out. - When we finally got home I decided I would go to the doctors. Ok so back to my symptoms. Since this first started I seem to get the following. I get the shakes EVERY day without fail and generally feel worse in the morning. Shakes and Nausea seem to always be together and the rest seem to be random. In the past 18 months I've been back and forth to the GP and had countless   taken (if anyone is interested in which tests then I am happy to post them with their results). Everything has come back as Satisfactory and after exhausting the GPs they finally referred me to the hospital to see an endocrinologist. When I went to meet the endo she listened to all my symptoms and gave me a physical examination. She said that she wanted me to have a Short   to test my adrenal functionality. - To my surprise this came back Abnormal. - This is the first test I've had where its actually come back like this. Everything else has been fine. It says that my level came back as the following ""Serum ACTH level 93.7 ng/L"" - Which makes no sense to me tbh. If anyone can give me an explanation of this level then I would be most grateful. Anyway I was quite happy to see that this had come back and I was thinking it proves that im not making any of this up. I had a follow up ""telephone appointment"" with my endo and she basically said that it shows that I've got a high level of Cortisol in my blood. The only way to lower this is for me to take up Yoga, breathing exercises and perhaps do some light cardio such as swimming. - Thats it. She wanted to discharge me. I said i want another follow up in a months time to see how im getting on by doing this and luckily she agreed.  I kind of feel like i've been   off tbh. Here i am feeling rubbish every day. I've tried to alter my diet, excercise and sleep routine and nothing has helped. Everyday I get the same symptoms. Mostly I get the shakes and nausea. I have had lots of other tests such as blood glucose, thyroid, vitamin deficiency, 24 hour urine sample and they have all come back as fine. Im sort of lost as what I can do. I've put this in here as after googling everything it feels like this forum might be the right place. Anyone with cushings have you had the same sort of symptoms etc? Is there anything else I can ask my endo to test? I hope someone sees this and thinks (that was me). Thanks. 0 likes, 13 replies "

I treated myself for Thrush by taking the tablet from the Pharmacy and using the thrush cream.  Again symptoms improved but did not go away. I have been through an enormous amount of stress recently and this pain began 2 weeks before an operation I was due to have to remove a cyst off my ovary (on the day of the op it was deemed unnecessary) but my stress levels had been raised massively prior to this.

I also had a miscarriage in September and have had a lot of bleeding and hormonal issues since then.  I was put on Cilest (birth control pill) to control the bleeding ‚Äì which it had started to do but then I had to come back off it in readiness for the Op.  So hormones are mucked about. The pain started 4 days after my husband and I had sex for the first time in 6 momths. Please can you advise?  There is no blood in my urine and the pain is at the end of urination - with some discomfort continuing after my first pee of the day. I have just seen our local Pharmacist who thinks it is Cystitis, but I do not have a UTI? Is it possible it is caused by anxiety?

A year ago I started a new relationship and ended up with a very painful UTI, blood in the urine, incredible painful! It was only the second I've ever had in my life. Took   and all cleared up fine. About two months later, again after sex with my new partner I ended up with an equally as painful one, again antibiotics kicked this one - first tried trimethoprim and then nitrofuratoin when that didn't work.  Again few months later I got another. This one wasn't as bad, no blood or stinging just frequency and twinges. Luckily I knew earlier than the previous two what was going to happen and was put on nitrofuratoin again. Since then I have had a further 6 UTIs over the course of a 6 month period.  They all stem from sex. I was put on daily trimethoprim that didn't work. So put on nitrofuratoin as a prophylactic after sex but I have just ended up with yet another one and this time nitrofuratoin doesn't seem to be kicking it so quickly. It's been over a week on them and I'm still getting twinges.  Worth noting that cultures were never run on my initial two UTIs, presumably because with the blood I was just treated ASAP.  Further 3 cultures - 2 have shown nothing, I presume because I started self treating, and the last one showed enterococcus.  Both myself and my partner have been tested and nothing found STD wise.  I'm at my wits end. I've tried cranberry, vitamin C, olive leaf extract, cysticlean, charcoal, d'Mannose, antibiotics. The lot!  The UTI symptoms I now get are different to my initial first two. I feel urgency but not stinging. There is a dull ache on my bladder and what can only be described as a spasm in my urethra. It spasms and almost goes from the bottom all the way up to my bladder in a sharp spam which then makes me need the loo.  - could this be IC caused by the initial UTI?  - am I now resistant to nitrofuratoin as that appears to not be treating it?  - is it an enterococcus UTI that just never went away and keeps coming back?  - I am now taking probiotics but is my immune system just out of whack with all the antibiotics and that's what's causing it? Just before I met my partner I was in hospital on IV antibiotics as well so could that have caused issues?  - my partner uses shampoo to wash down there (!) - could this be a reaction to that rather than a UTI per see?

They took out a golf ball 4 years ago. No cancer has come back, and that is spectacular, BUT..... We have gone to the ER at least a dozen times since then for  intense pain. At least a half dozen hospital stays with no known cause for said pain. My husband is a volunteer fireman, a macho man, not a whiny baby. For the brain surgery they pushed nerves out of the way and cut some. The right side of his face was paralyzed, not stroke, just angry nerves. Over the years he has regained some movement, he can close his eyes and his mouth. It took months to get from wheelchair to walker, more months walker to cane, and more months cane to without cane. During these 4 years he has had intense headaches, but we figured brain cancer and brain surgery- duh! Hospitalized for intense chest pain, but we figured he has had a heart attack- duh! So, today, lower left back pain.... Hospital, tests. There is nothing in that area except the kidney and muscles. They did urine, blood and ct scan. No urinary tract/kidney infection. No kidney stones. No scarring of kidney, no nothing. Great blood results, great kidney function, clean urine, no bacterial infections. With all eh chest pain visits, clear EKG, no arrhythmia, no blockage stent still in place, no ulcers (can present as chest pain), endoscopy shows beautiful clean insides. Headaches: clean brain scans, no sinus issues, no blockage, no infection. So, why pain? We were getting so frustrated. Until today!!!!! I had an epiphany! Intense pain in various regions with no known cause. Upset and cut nerves. ""Ghost"" pain!!!! Nerves shooting off and causing pain for no reason. There was a cause, originally. Now there is no sign of that cause, but the pain is real. I have been researching for hours. I have found a glimmer here, and a mention there. Most people are at the ""what is making me hurt"" stage, but most also report some sort of head/brain trauma. They are mostly at the ""I am not crazy, I hurt, why won't the doctor believe me"" area. I am throwing this out there to see if we can find a correlation between undiagnosed (because nothing IS there) severe pain in odd parts of you after brain trauma/surgery. Anybody else? Thanks!!! We can make a difference, we can bring this to the attention of the medical community.  We are not crazy, we are in pain. 0 likes, 4 replies "

I have a high pitched tone in my head all the time and it's annoying. When it first started (about ten years ago) it would be agonizing and torturously loud and would ruch on me the instant I fell asleep, catching me just before I lost conscoiousness, and I would feel stuck inside myself for a second, suffocating, being anihalated by that immense noise, struggling to wake up it felt like drowning but with a sound so loud I wished I was dead. Absolutely terrifying, but when it was that loud it wasn't a tone more a high pitched pulse maybe three pulses per second, like a fast high pitched sledge hammer pounding away on the inside of the head. The first night I couldn't sleep from this I thought I may never sleep again and die a horrible death, passing out into that tortue when I couldn't hold myself awake any longer, I ran from my house and just roamed the streets crying. After some time I came back home, and I managed to fall asleep. That's how it started, but that tone has never gone and it's always been there, it's there right now.The tone doesn't get like that anymore but it does get very loud and pulsing when im in bed or when my eyes are closed sometimes. Has anyone heard of anything like this? Any ideas what it might be? If it may be curable? I don't feel like I'm losing my hearing or anything like that.

I exercise at least 4 days out of 7. So thats a bit of background however on Friday I burnt 4000 calories and I worked for 7 hours straight, now I was moving around a lot but I didn't feel like I over over exerting myself. However since Friday I've been getting spells of feeling weird sensations down the left side of my body. In my left thigh and in the lower part of my upper arm. Sometimes I feel something in my upper chest too. It seems to come into play mainly when I go to bed like now, I've been fine all day and when I lay in bed it started. I was fine 2 days but it has happend 3 days and one day I felt it a bit at work. After I felt it I took it a bit easy at work but I still burnt over 3500 calories each day. Am I overexerting myself? Is something bad happening with it being the left side? Do I just need rest? I am a bit worried with it being the left side and that normally being a sign of a heart attack. Has anyone got any ideas?

Pain and Pain Relief,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/the-chronic-pain-that-ruined-my-life-687878,The chronic pain that ruined my life,"Seven years ago I began to suffer from chronic pain, which extends to all regions of my back and neck. It is important to note that the pain is completely chronic, it has not stopped for a moment during the last seven years. The pain over the years has grown stronger and stronger to the point where I have not slept at night for the past six months, until finally I collapse from fatigue in the mornings. The pain is sustained by standing or sitting for a long time, so it is very hard for me to work. Consider the fact that I can not find work that can be done lying down. After two or three hours of standing, the pain is on the pain scale from 5/10 to 7-8/10, an unbearable situation that requires immediate rest. From a person who has been able to work full-time in the past, I found myself working only four times a week, between three and six hours a day, and earning a minimum wage at work that requires physical effort. My partner is against me, working and earning about 10 to 25 times what I earn, with no effort, at her workplace. She runs a restaurant, and this is a role she has earned through long-term work at the place, rather than through learning courses or a degree. Recently our relationship has seen the problem that if we choose to move in together, I will in a sense be a leech, and live on her money. She said she had no problem with it, and that she would support me in every way she could, but I can not accept it, and this creates enormous conflicts between us that might break up our relationship. It is important to note that I have been in all the possible tests, the doctors have already given up on him completely, and thought that I was crazy, the pain I suffer from is expressed in the areas where the pain is present, when the pain begins to grow stronger. The source of the problem remains a mystery, and the doctors and medical experts all recommended that I take pain pills, the strongest (and most unhealthy) type, throughout the rest of my life. I also ask for advice on the issue of the matter with the company, and also on the health issue, I can not receive recognition from the extent of my pain and receive the percentage disability / monthly disability pension because the problem was not found medically.

Need help !!!,"Hi All I have had flank pain on the right side and doctors still don't know what is wrong It all started in august when I woke up with  an excruciati pain on the right side. I had kidney stones throuhout my teenage years and I recognised the pain straight away ! I ended up at the A&E at 6am and went through urine and blood tests, and also had a CT scan. All results came back negative, no infection but 2 unobstructive kidney stones on the left side. Ironic though because they were completely pain free. I came back home with painkillers. Within the following days, the pain persisted but I didn't get worried because when I had kidney stones in the past, I always got this residual pain for a few days. So I carried on with life however, after a week or so, I kept having sharp pain on my right front abdomen and sensation of compression around my right kidney. I went to my GP, he called the hospital I was discharged of to have further details about my CT scan. He found out that my appendice was normal and that I had a cyst on my right ovary. Back to the hospital, admitted in acute gynaecology where I had more blood and urine tests and an ultrasound (internal, external, the full pack !!). They did confirm the ovarian cyst but they were not the cause of my pain. My symptoms and the location of my pains pointed more towards the kidney and urinary tract. The day after, I had a KUB ultrasound which showed nothing. Everything was normal and still no sight of a kidney stone !! Frustration started... I then went back to my GP to get an urology referral. I saw the urologist a few weeks later. In th emeantime, the pains were still there, as well as a loss of appetite, occasional vomiting and diarrhoea, fatigue, reduced mobility as I was in agony whenever I moved. I also nearly fainted once and had what seems to be a very bad apnic attack (shaking for nearly 3h !!!). When I saw the urologist, he prescribed more bllod and urine tests, a CT scan with contrasts and an MRI of my spine (to rule out a neuropathic problem). Everithing went back normal !!! More frustrations...! So he made a referral for a pain management consultant. At this point I was taking Diclofenac (anti inflammatory), buscopan (anti spasmodic) and codeine (painkiller). On top of that the consultant added pregabalin (for nerve pain). The mix seemed to work for a couple of weeks or so, so I was seeing things more positively. However, at some points, when I started feeling better, I gradually reduced the medication as advised by the doctors, one drug at a time. It started well for the first few weeks, and then it went all wrong. After I stopped the last drug,the anti inflammatory, the apin came back within 4 days, full on ! So I started to take the anti inflammatory.  Since then, I cope with it and codeine occasionally. It is very strange because I can have a good week with little pain and suddenly it just comes back out of the blue, or after some activities (walking fast, standing up for more than 1h, running...). I still can't bear to lay on my right side.  I can identify some patterns in the frequency and the kind of pain: more sore on the front right flank in the morning, dull ache around my kidney at mid day til the evening when the pain seems to spread on my flank and across my back, like a burning sensation.  However, lately, I started to have occasional stabbing pain on the kidney area. This is extremely painful and worrying. i will see the urologist in afew weeks and I am hoping he will do a more thorough investigation. So far, as the scans and tests show nothing, his strategy is to try different medications to ease the pain. I am so frustrated  and confused by this mystery illness. It has been more than 3 months and has impacted on my professional and personal life. I can't keep going like this ! I am desperate for answers either from professionals or patients having similar symptoms. Please HELP !!!!!  0 likes, 17 replies "

Example 2: if I'm driving on normal speed and if someone is kinda like tailgating and if i saw speed camera, i drive fast but also slow to manage between both camera and car behind.  That time pain again on right armpit. Example 3: When watching movie or YT clip even the simple action/thriller or comedy, i sensitively know what is going to happen and that time burning pain on right armpit. Feels like lump is trying to pop out. It has been on and off for like 2, 3 Years. Went to GP,  result i get is due to stress/anxiety. But i don't think so, i can control stress with my mind by walking at park, cooking food and having funny talk with my wife and family friends. Now recently, it's paining too much, burning, tingling, sharp and dull, BUT not itching and no rashes. sometimes sharp pain on side of the neck. I've tried home remedies, essential oils, still having such pain. Note 1: I've also got one weird thing happened a year ago, something drilled from my right ear to left ear, like big insect passing through quickly, felt like tremor in between two ears. Explained to GP, he told me it's weird but nothing to worry about. Come again if it happens again. it was that one time though but still curious about it. Note 2: I feel like I'm losing sexuality. It doesn't erect like it used to. Only erects when I forced myself watch sex scenes and imagine such sexual stuff deeply. I do have open sex with my wife only. But for about a year I don't feel like having sex. Not to anyone, not even to my wife. I also have few moles appeared on balls and around and one circle rash on skin of penis near the top. Went to Sexual clinic, says normal. But why am i losing sexual desire and not erecting hard enough to do sex? Note 3: After I finish my meal whether lunch or dinner, there is sharp pain inside my throat when i try to gargle and cough. It also comes little bit saliva mixed of saliva coloured mucus. I also poop a lot like 5,6 times a day mostly, otherwise 3,4. It is not diarrhea, just straight one or sometimes fluppy pieces, or thin layers or muddy. Sometimes it comes within 1 hour of eating meals. I eat in Moderation. Same with urination. I have to pee 3,4 time within hour of drinking just one glass of water and i drink a lot like very 2 hours. When urinating, sharp burns on abdomen, feels very empty. Note 4: When I pour water on kettle, and if at that time i think of bad person i know or not suddenly, i throw that  and again pour water this time avoiding thinking bad person. Same like when i have chitchat with my wife and if something bad stuff or person comes in my mind, i start good conversation again. it seems like my mind just want good things between me and my family. Not traumatised by any person and Not Mental problem at all. Just making me do repetitive things by clearing my mind. These are my problems happening in my life for 2,3 years. It is making me stress like too much, but little as I think positive about my life and stay out of stress taking my dog for a walk or go for hike and eat good food at various places, taking pictures and making plans with my family. However, i would like to know why is it happening. I'm also thinking of having baby but my healthy isn't looking good no matter I'm health conscious. Is there some deadly pain hidden in my body?

I got this problem for around 6 years already, however now the pain is way stronger. About a year ago my wrists started to hurt, so hard that it was difficult to hold cutlery while eating. It feels as if someone was drilling in my joints. After that both of my knees started hurting as well. I find it difficult to walk on stairs, drive a car. All of daily activityies become difficult. After some time my elbows started hurting, as well as ankles. Every day I am in pain - does not matter if it's a day or night. I often wake up at night from pain, that later paralizes me. I always was physically active - lots of work & sport, however now once I start exercising or doing physical activity, the pain gets worse. I do not have any edemas around the joints. A few times a day I got raised body temperature - around 37-38 degrees. Usually I feel cold, got cold hands and feet. Sometimes I get  , diarrhea or flatulence, however the USG of my stomach was alright. I also did erythrocyte sedimentation rate test and it was good as well. I am doing lots of possible tests, seeing lots of doctors, but no-one so far can tell me what's exactly wrong with me. The most recent tests showed that I got degenerative-overloaded joints, reactive hypoglycemia and depressive disorders. I got prescribed the following medicines: Also I was adviced to do rehabilitation, visit a ginecologist and check my lower back in half a year. Any advice is highly appreciated.

In the first 4 years, the pain was so unbearable that I could continue to be on the computer or walk with people and go to sleep and just know that they were there but ignore them because they were not dominant, but only with a noticeable presence. Slowly since then, they have become so strong that they have become unbearable in the last two years, when in the past year they have reached the level of chronic pain that does not stop with pain 6 to 9 out of 10 if you ask me. The pains are most terrible. I have reached the point where I have not slept at night for the past six months. I am writing this post now at 09:02 IN THE MORNING. After I had not slept all night and lay in bed and only suffered from pain, that was what all my nights had looked like for the past six months. At certain moments I already feel desperate and it's hard for me to live like this. I'm still supposed to be inducted for a month, I have been in the process of medical inquiries for a while, I've tried everything you can think of. Orthopedic specialist, spine specialist, photos and MRI specialist muscle and joint physiotherapy and what not. No one found anything that could cause pain. I reached the point where I was supposed to be drafted for another month. I told them that I was f*****g half a year. I did not sleep at night because of my pain. My routine got to the point that all day I moved from my computer chair to my bed. Can not sit for half an hour without unbearable pain beginning to make me lie down. Sometimes I get up in the morning and it's so busy and painful that I have to crawl out of bed to the bathroom. I have reached the point where I stand in front of the IDF and they think that I am lying and that I do not really hurt. What frightens me is that not only can I not find a solution or a cure, I tried all the   and they did not help, even now they force me to enlist in combat. I do not sleep all night and then at 5 wake me up for running and exercises and I'm finished. And wants to go to sleep at 10 am after a crash, and do not let me, and it does damage to my body's systems. And I already see how they force me to do things like running and adopting my body in a situation where even for five minutes I can not get into a state of collapse from pain. I am just in a state of abnormal frustration that floods the entire body and simply prevents me from thinking, functioning and even rejoicing. The pain paralyzes me and the worry that my body and health will be hurt even more because Yael and the doctors do not believe / find the cause of my problem drives me crazy. I have already lost algae and I'm fed up with living with the pain. I was advised to go to a psychiatrist because the pain may be from a mental source and he said that it is known that a person who has suffered from  , stress, stress problems, and so on. That, she gave me Klux I took 2mg and it did not help at all and did not feel any relief from the condition or pain. I doubt anyone here knew how to help me if all the doctors did not know but I'm trying my luck. Maybe there's someone here who knows how to give advice. 0 likes, 0 replies "

","Hello, I have chronic over all pain, both in my joints and muscles.  I've had over all pain for many years but able to keep it at a dull roar with over-the-counter Aleve. It has gotten worse thru time and am now taking 2 Aleve every 3 hours to keep the pain down.  I am 62 years old and credited the original aches and pains to my very active work in later years.  My muscles have always slightly tingled when I lay still and quiet in bed probably the last 20 years but thinking no pain, no gain and always manageable.   I've been retired for several years now but kept up good exercise on my treadmill and stay active daily.  Because of the pain, I am now down to a 1 hour walk a day on the treadmill. I walk 6 days a week, religiously.  The pain is from my neck down and thru my body, all joints and muscles.  With the pain relief, it's unbearable.   I do not have headaches or any trouble in my head or face area nor my hands, just body.  I worked as an outside technician for telephone companies, installing and repairing lines.  In a day, 1/2 aerial pole work connections and 1/2 buried plant connections, including daily customers, so stayed very active and enjoyed the work.  I have never been sickly, always a healthy, active lifestyle.  My question... is this normal to have this much joint and muscle pain as we get older?  I am concerned about taking so much daily pain relief and still have the constant pain I feel.   I have not activated my medical coverage to date because of the huge expense, about $700 a month just for myself.  I can not afford that much each month.  Also, further information, I could be a candidate for Parkinson's as my grandmother had a slight form of this disease.  Her hands and head would shake but not wildly.   Sometimes I feel a very light tremor in my legs and feet when I lay still.  I have not gone to the doctor as I read they have no way to test for Parkinson's disease officially.  They test for many other causes to rule out symptoms.  I appreciate any help to try to figure this out.  If I'm not allowed to say brand names, I take naproxen sodium tablets, 220 mg.

Just wondering if any of you kind folk would be able to give me some ideas as to what it could be.

Firstly, I get this odd electric shock type pain in an area about two inches directly below my belly button. There has felt like a constantly discomfort in that area all day, and I've felt slightly nauseous all day, but every now and and again the pain changes to this electric shock type pain that almost takes my breath away. this shock pain doesn't last long, 30 seconds to 1 minute max, then goes back to the discomfort type pain. On top of that I seem to flatulating (farting) a lot more than usual, plus I've been getting odd moments where I can feel areas of my lower abdomen are fluttering. The shock type pain, flatulating and fluttering don't seem to coincide with each other or with anything I do, it's all very random. Apart from that everything else with me seems fine. No  , sickness or bowel movement issues, pulse and temperature seem fine, I don't think I've strained anything, haven't really done much to strain anything anyway, its all very strange.

Anyways, after the night ended around 3 am, we got to fast food resturant for late dinner and after a couple of bites i had a severe stabbing  pain just below my right ribs. the pain would last for 10 seconds and desappear for like fe mins  or so. then, it hit again for 10 seconds. this lasted until i got to sleep around 5 am. i was able to get good sleep, when i woke up it was fine up until i had lunch. after lunch the same pain in the same area and the same way of 10  seconds few mins pattern happened.  i looked online and Pancreatitis showed up.  i thought my pain was not severe to the point of hospitalization so thought if the pain presist after going home (i had a flight that day) i would go to hospital. well, the pain was gone  when i got to the airport like around 6 pm the same day. this was all on the 24th of FEB 2018. . the following 4 days were okay  with no pain at all but was feeling fatigued the whole time. so on FEB 28 i decided to get blood samples for amalayse and lipase (through private laboratory ) and the results were normal. i thought maybe it was a bad case of  , especially that i had a prior endoscopy in OCT 2017 which confirmed gastritis. During the last year, i have been dealing with severe acid reflux and bloating and mild   and always put it up to gastritis.  however, the last few months i have noticed  that my stool is often bulky, sticks to the toilet wall and has strong odor. i told the my doc my current symptoms and he requested an ultrasound for the abdomen which was normal expect that the pancreas was not visible. my question are: 1- Do normal amaylase and lipase levels after 4 days of onset of pain rules out  ? 2- what test can be done to rule out   now? i am so confused since i was never diagnosed with acute case and so i dont want to requests tests based on my thinking and self diagnoses. thank you in advance for your support and sorry for the long post.

This world ain't good in my book. Though I heard that endoscopic ultrasound is the best to diagnose. My pancreas has to be damaged. I sometimes get chills at night and bloating. 0 likes, 10 replies "

Pancreatitis and Pancreatic Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/how-to-deal-with-family-during-tests-682410,How to deal with family during tests,"Hi everyone, I am a 41 man. 2018 is being a year full of happenings. At the beginning of the year, abdominal discomfort led me to find out I had gallstones and - almost by accident and thanks to a very scrupulous doctor - a 4cm mass in my colon - which fortunately was benign. Very rare for a 41! But apparently I am going thorough more challenges. Early in the summer, I started having occasional back pain. Nothing serious, just annoying, and it would come and go. During August, I had a mild pain on my upper-left abdomen, that lasted a couple of days. I dismissed that as not significant. But then I noticed something strange in my stool. After the  , I took the habit to check my stool, and saw that at times they were very greasy, and that there was like an oily film on the toilet water. 4 weeks ago the pain in my back started to become more frequent, and intense, eventually waking me up at night. A nasty burning feeling between my shoulder blades. My doctors said it could be something related to my pancreas and ordered  ; according to the results, he will evaluate if an endo-scan is going to be necessary. I am now waiting for the blood test result. I do not know how to deal with this, and I feel alone. My wife is very worried - as I am - that I might have PC. I struggle to keep focus at work, mainly because in the recent days my back pain affects me during the day too and reminds me that there is something wrong. My sleep is becoming poor as I wake up regularly   at 3am with that burning pain between my shoulder blades, that seems to move around my spine according to the position I take in bed. I have not said anything to my parents because I don‚Äôt want them to worry for (maybe) nothing, but I am not sure that this is fair. What do you suggest? Should I talk to them now? I'm also asking myself if I should speed up the process and ask my doctor to sign me for an endo-scan or CT straight away. Thank you 0 likes, 25 replies "

Pancreatitis and Pancreatic Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/does-this-sound-like-chronic-pancreatitis-to-you--664916,Does this sound like Chronic Pancreatitis to you?,"Hey Friends, wondering if anyone can help steer me in the right direction. I have had pain and soreness ON my left rib cage, under my breast and around to under my arm pit - following the rib cage line - for the past 6 years. It is worse if I am constipated (sorry for TMI), and much worse if I have wine. I am not a heavy drinker, but did enjoy a couple glasses on the weekends. I have not had any for a few months, and the pain seemed better overall. I had champagne this week at a celebration - not a lot - a couple of glasses, and the pain the next day was the worse in a while - not so much that I can't function, but always there, like a burning, sore to the touch feeling on my rib cage. It's better when I am lying down, very still. And as I said, it is the left rib cage itself, not below. I have had multiple CT scans that show only diverticulosis and colon polyps. I have had an MRI that was normal, and an ultrasound that showed a mildly fatty pancreas. My GI doctor says it is not my pancreas, but I just don't know what else it would be, given the area that hurts. I have diarrhea at times, especially after any alcohol ( which I am again done with), and am often constipated. My bloodwork over the years, including pancreatic enzymes is always normal. So I guess, does it sound like  ? I have not lost weight, but am frequently bloated. I want to see another GI, but I am afraid they will not pursue it. It's been going on for so long, and the doctors give me no answer. I do have stress (don't we all?). I have a daughter with autism, one with Asperger's, and care for my mom with dementia. But still, I cannot figure out why this always hurts. If it is chronic pancreatitis, would I benefit from starting enzymes now? Many, many thanks.

Palsy - Non Cerebral,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/bell-s-palsy-for-2-months-now-am-i-recovering--592456,Bell's palsy for 2 months now... am I recovering?,"I got Bell's palsy march 26th 2017. I was getting these weird migraines on the left side of my head in the temple region for like a month before it happened. A few days before it started, I noticed I couldn't open my mouth all the way. Then I was eating soup and it tasted like I had burned my tongue really bad. Then my face started twitching on the left side EVERYWHERE. like my eyebrow, my nose, my lips, my chin, my cheek. Then I woke up on march 26th and couldn't keep water in my mouth while brushing my teeth on the left side.  I went to the er and they diagnosed me with Bell's palsy. They told me it was a mild case, but it just hadn't actually set in all the way yet. They gave me the anti virals and prednisone. They only gave me 20 mg prednisone that I took for 4 days only. Idk if they only gave me this much because of my weight (I weigh 140) or because they thought it was a mild case.  when I was reading online I saw ppl taking way higher doses for longer periods of time. Anyway it set all the way in and I could still close my eye a little bit it wasn't just open like some other ppl. I could still smile a little. But then it seemed like things were getting worse and I couldn't smile anymore at all.  I had a little droop. And instead of my eye being dry it just waters all day. I asked my doctor and he said steroids aren't good for you and they can do harm to other parts of your body. He was pretty much useless. So 3 weeks went by and I still wasn't getting any improvement. The taste in my toungue was coming back and it stopped hurting so bad. (At first I had shooting pains in my head and on the left side of my face). My hearing was hyper sensitive also and that went away too.  I still wasn't getting any movement and was getting discouraged because I seen some ppl recover in 3 to 4 weeks.  I saw some ppl did acupuncture and it worked for them so I decided to give that a try at 3 weeks. I hadn't been to a neurologist yet because I couldn't get an appointment soon enough the one my insurance covered was all booked up.  I did 6 sessions of acupuncture, with 3 regular sessions with just putting the needle in my face, and then 3 with electrostim. It seemed the acupuncture was working because I got some movement back in my cheek to where I could move part of my cheek by myself, and I was also getting twitching in some other places. I finally got a hold of a neurologist around 6 weeks and he told me there's no data on acupuncture working so I stopped going. By six weeks I had gained movement back in my neck, I could move my chin a little, I can raise my eyebrow a little, and I could move my ear... at 8 weeks now I can move the corner of my mouth just a little like its trying to smile. I also still have some twitching that goes on on my Bell's palsy side every now and then. But also, when I look in the mirror and try and smile and see what movements are coming back, my muscles feel kind of tight. Not when my face is at rest, but when I try and smile. I can see some other areas twitching in my cheek when I try to smile, like it's trying to work but it's to weak or something. My fear is that the electro stim and acupuncture made things worse and that's why It feels tight like that when I try to smile. Also when I move my lips a certain way or when I put hot water on my face I can feel my lips like pull upward on that side and there's a crease in my cheek like as if I'm smirking a little but I'm not. It's weird and only happens for a little Bit of time then goes back to normal. What is this? Also I can still only move that one part of my cheek and the the crease that comes when you smile still isn't moving yet... is this normal? I'm going to see my neurologist again on Thursday but I am a major worry wart and I keep worrying I made this worse by doing acupuncture and the electro Stim. Am i recovering okay or is something wrong? I also now get some headache and face pain on that side again but it's not as bad as it was when I first got it. I am 24 years old and my job has everything to do with how you look and is very competitive so I haven't been at work for 2 months. Just been staying home. I will admit I have been fighting with my significant other way more but than ever before and probably am more stressed than I should be. I also smoke weed sometimes to sleep and noticed that sometimes when I smoke I get more twitching on that side. Is twitching good? Because my face was twitching when it started, so don't know if it is it seems like it is good though because for like 3 weeks I had no twitching no movement at all on that side of my face. I hate this so much I'm so sad because I loved my smile before and I am a very pretty girl. I feel I've lost my face and I'm praying it will come back.... is muscle tightness when trying to move that side normal or is this a sign of synkinesis? I am so scared and keep crying I just want someone who's had this and recovered to let me know I'm recovering the right way? I also take b12, zinc, magnesium, multi vitamins and b6. I know it's only been two months but I'm scared my face will not go back to normal fully. Please someone help.  1 like, 47 replies "
