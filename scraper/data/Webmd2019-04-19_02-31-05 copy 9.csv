After a few minutes she ends up in the bathroom with diarrhea or what she calls ""sludgey"" bowel movements. We do have IBS, she has had an endoscopy, colonoscopy, h.pylori test, blood and biopsy test for celiac, tested for pancreatitis and everyone says the tests show nothing. She doesn't have Crohn's disease or any ulcers. She tried eating gluten free to see if she had a gluten allergy. She was diagnosed with excessive acid in her stomach. She takes acid pills for this but is still sick. She hardly eats, she is malnourished and just looks likes she's widdling down to nothing and slowly dying. She's only 22 and nobody can find anything wrong, but she is sick and in pain daily. Has any had this or know what could be making her sick?",
Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/34684/husband-s-issues,Husband's Issues,"Long story short, my husband was diagnosed with Gastric and Esophageal Cancer almost three years ago and had his Stomach and then his Esophagus removed one year a part (2015 and 2016). He has had chemo and radiation and now immune therapy (cancer peritoneal) . Since the esophagectomy and small intestines pull through to become his way to eat (small intestine is attached in front of his heart to the small left over esophagus)...he has been able to eat almost anything he wants. He gained almost 50 pounds since his surgery. Lately his food stops about chest high and will not pass and therefore he regurgitates his food and now has lost 10 pounds. He had an endoscopy and an upper GI barium test over the past two days. Both test saw food remaining in his upper intestines. Doctor is afraid the pulled through small intestines has lost his mobility and contracting ability to move food. Is there anything he can do to promotes the food to pass through down to his lower intestines and to his colon without throwing up? Digest his food? He had two feeding tubes during the surgery. They were removed. He wants to continue to eat normal. Any suggestions?",Bloating
Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/34685/going-on-a-dairy-free-trial-and-feeling-withdrawals,Going on a dairy-free trial and feeling withdrawals,"I've been seeing a nutritionist/registered dietitian for the last several months because, well, I've always struggled to get all of what our bodies need (it's been hard to willingly eat the right number of fruits, veggies, and fiber), but also to see if I could do anything on that end to get rid of the chronic constipation I've dealt with all of my life. Suffice to say, drinking the right amount of water and adding more fiber/greens hasn't helped me out. I've even been taking a broad spectrum probiotic, as recommended by my dietitian, but, again, no change to my bowel habits (I think taking the probiotic twice a day for several days made me feel sick, so I'm back to taking it only once a day). With all of this (which I've been working on for the greater half of this year), my dietitian decided I should try to cut out all dairy products for 3-4 weeks to see if I might have a dairy sensitivity (while intolerance causes diarrhea, she told me that a sensitivity can cause constipation). I started it yesterday after having tried out and chosen some dairy alternative products (her recommendation of pea-based Ripple Milk is great, as it has the same amount of protein as cow's milk, but isn't as sweet or watery as a lot of other alternative milk, and I found a dairy-free, plant-based ""butter"" that tastes just like butter...but I'll avoid any fake cheese like the plague, because what I tried tasted like sacrilege!).  BUT...on the morning of Day 2 (the day I am writing this post), I'm already feeling withdrawals. I feel a bit weak, even though I had a protein-rich snack and lunch (used Ripple Milk in my cereal for breakfast, so I got the same protein I would have gotten if it was cow's milk), foggy-headed (almost like a headache, but not really), and I am CRAVING sweets like no tomorrow. It sucks! Not to mention the agonizing realization that, during this trial period, I will have to avoid a lot of pastries and chocolate that are brought into my office (unless if someone had the heart to bring in Mighty-O donuts instead of Top Pot), and avoid all pre-made breakfast sandwiches served in any cafe, since cheese comes on them by default (and they are usually frozen/refrigerated, so the cheese can't be taken off before heating up). I mean...at least restaurants where they make their plates from scratch can honor a customer's request to not even add dairy products. It's only Day 2 and it's maddening to think how much food I love has dairy in it, even food that I honestly would never imagine would have dairy at all (same with things that have wheat/gluten - why add something extra to foods/drinks that has nothing to do with it? Which is why hard cider being labeled as ""gluten free"" cracks me up. But, no, I am not cutting out gluten, just dairy). And almost anything I see in grocery stores that has dairy taken out is labeled as ""vegan"" - I am not going vegan! I have nothing against eating animal byproducts! I just can't have dairy until the trial is over and I see if it made any difference. Can't things be just ""dairy-free"" instead of lumped up under the ""vegan"" label?? Well, anyway, that's my story, and I hope that perhaps people could give me some advice (besides what my dietitian already told me) on how to successfully get through the next 3-4 weeks...and how to treat the withdrawals I'm already experiencing. I should point out that I already take a Vitamin D supplement every day, since I get some seasonal blues with the lack of daylight.",

Moderation.,"Living a lifestyle conducive to heart health doesn't have to be all deprivation and no fun. Moderation is the key to developing long-term healthy habits.  Diet, exercise, and stress management are three of the key factors affecting heart health (outside of genetics).  —Reducing the amount of processed and fast foods, which tend to be high in sodium, sugar, and refined grains, is a no-brainer.  —Moderate amounts of alcohol, especially red wine, can actually improve heart health. —Exercising a few times a week can have a significant impact on your heart. —Add in some stress-reducing activities, and you'll be well on your way to a sustainable lifestyle that's good for your body and mind.

Sexual Health & STDs,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/20414/notice-small-bumps-on-penis-head,Notice Small Bumps on penis head,"I noticed small bumps on the head of my penis after masturbating about a week ago. After masturbation, I noticed there was blood. A minuscule amount. Stop bleeding after 2 wipes. I figured it was because I was too rough and didn't use any sort of lube. Also around that time, I was masturbating maybe twice a day. Shortly after this particular instance, I start to noticed my glands were red and raise a bit and inflamed. From a distance, it looked like a rash but up close I noticed tiny bumps. As you can see from the photos the tip of the penis head starts off smooth and the texture starts to look bumpy as you go down and then smooth again. It seems the rough texture is concentrated in that specific region of the penis head. I would like to say I didn't notice it before but I hadn't looked at my penis that closely until I realized there was slight blood after I masturbated. I would also like to say I remember the penis head being smooth all the way around and don't think I had those bumps previously but at the same time I didn't examine my penis with as much scrutiny before so it may have been there previously without me noticing.  I initially thought I had balanitis because I am uncircumcised and the inflammation didn't seem to go down nor the redness and I also noticed the bumps. Also, I'm consistently in the gym so I figured the sweat would be an ideal environment for balanitis, yeast, thrush. I start using Lotrimin for jock itch. The redness has gone down and not as red as previously but I still notice the bumps. If I was to have sex or masturbate the inflammation would return but would go down. Although it's not as red as previously It's just that area always seems to be redder than the rest of the penis head. I wanted to know is this a cause for concern. I'm still using the Lotrimin cream as the directions state to use it for 2 weeks. If I pull my foreskin all the way back you can see that the area looks somewhat like a scar or an abrasion. From a distance now it seems as if the penis head is wrinkled in that region but if I pull back the foreskin and examine closer with the phone there are small bumps. The bumps are painless as well as the head of the penis, I have no discharge, it does not itch. No pus. No boils or blisters, no pain when I urinate. Other than the appearance of the penis head I feel fine. I uploaded pictures as well. The pictures are from a very close angle. I attached multiple pics from various angles. I plan on scheduling an STD check sometime this week but wanted to know if there is anything particular I should check for? Is this normal? Is this a cause for concern? Is there anything I can use to help it go down? Should I use a different cream? Anything would help. Please see link to view photos",

This is pretty embarrassing but curious if i need to go see my Gyno. My boyfriend and I were having sex, as we normally would but I was slightly dry towards the end, which left me pretty sore the next day. It almost seemed to get worse as the day went and especially when I peed. It would burn REALLY bad, only on the actually skin that felt like it had been burned or torn. (Kind of like what a rug burn feels like, very tender to touch). Throughout the day it wasn't too bad but every time I peed that part of my skin would burn and sting, bad. At first the burning sensation was only felt if I touched it, peed or wiped, but now when I wipe there's a little bit of blood, from when I pat dry. After doing some research it seems like I have a vaginal tear from dry sex. What should I do? Will it heal on its own? I put neosporin on it the first day and the. Read that I shouldn't, if it's internal, which it is. Are there any over the counter products I should use? I prefer not to go the the doctor, unless I really have to. Thanks!",Women's Issues

These problems consist of sharp stomach cramps, usually after eating, followed by diarrhea. This happens a few times a week and lasts about an hour. It has continued since then, but has improved slightly. I also sometimes have nausea instead of diarrhea. I have been to my primary care doctor multiple times and have been waiting on an appointment for GI and my appointment is scheduled for late January.

Every time I have had a bowel movement I have bled, sometimes more than others but every time has enough that it is concerning. I have only had diaherrea twice since it started.

Here is my situation: I am in a long distance relationship. While my girlfriend was away I had been unfaithful and had slept with one other woman (unprotected) a week before my GF's return home. When my gf came back I didnt feel any symptoms. However after 2 weeks or so I felt symptoms of yeast infection. However, just to be sure I went to see a doctor and got my urine tested, and Chlamydia and gonorrhea were negative. So I assumed that it was yeast and had used some cream for treatment. Over two weeks the symptoms still existed which explained to me that it wasnt yeast infection. I only had sex two times with my GF over this time period. I thought it was safe after receiving negative results from my STD tests. However since my symptoms continued I visited my doctor again and he wanted to test for Ureaplasma Urealyticum and Mycoplasma, which I was tested positive. After I had sex with my GF two times, she had symptoms of Yeast Infection. This was her first time having symptoms of this kind. As she is a nurse, she naturally thought that it was yeast infection and treated her self with over the counter cream. After 1 day of cream usage, her symptoms were gone. Here are my concerns and questions: 1. What is the transmission rate of Ureamasma Urealyticum. I did have unprotected sex two times with my girlfriend. Is the transmission rate high? 2. Is it highly likely that she is infected or was it just Yeast infection?","Women's Issues , Men's Issues"

The first time, I was grocery shopping and it felt like my heart quit beating. I was instantly hot and aggravated and it felt like it took my breath away. I could tell that I was losing my ability to balance and stand, rather quickly. I had to lean on the handle area of the cart. I felt my chest and there was nothing...no beat...then after thinking to myself that I was in serious trouble, It started again, though at first it was insanely rapid and in a couple spurts for a moment at first, then began to level out. I was dizzy and felt completely exhausted. Everything seemed to move funny...like a delayed vision...almost a slow motion effect of sorts. I couldn't make out a lot of what my girlfriend was saying to me.   It took me a few days to correct the exhaustion. My girlfriend told me ""I"" was the one that seemed like was in slow motion. She says I moved slow and spoke slow.  I counted it as an ""I lived"" experience and kept going along.  About 2 weeks ago, while sitting on the couch watching tv with her...i had just finished saying something and passed out. Out of the blue. I felt fine before then....aside from a sinus infection Ive been fighting 2 months...but it was like someone just flipped my power switch out of nowhere. I remember it going dark and thinking, ""This feels good!"", as I felt my muscles all over, relax. Especially by upper back and neck. Then, just after then though, My head snapped back up and my eyes were open....I was confused for a moment but otherwise seemed fine. I don't know how long the instance actually was or if she even noticed it.....  Now, about a week ago, I had another heart stopping moment while also sitting on the couch, like the one before. Though the after effects didn't seem as severe, aside from the exhaustion. My chest did hurt for a day or two after that one though.  I've been having moments that feel like ""something"" is going to happen fairly regularly since. Almost once every day....and one night I had very big issues trying to sleep because it felt like it was constantly trying to do that again. I could feel it wasn't right...  I do know my family has heart disease issues that have even claimed a family member younger than I am. I am 39. Sadly, those issues are on both sides of the family.  There are other issues such as dementia, that my mother has. No idea if that somehow plays a role in any of this.  I'm growing concerned....and very confused.",

I have had elevated blood pressure since I was in middle school where I was followed closely.

Since then I have had several tests, 2 echos, hand full of ECGs, 3 holters, stress test, etc. ALL coming up with PVCs, PACs and tachycardia but no significant findings. My med dose has been increased a few times but I continue to have symptoms of tachycardia and palpitations. I am now a very active 31 yo woman.

I am very grateful for no significant issues but I go through the same tests year after year without any reason or explanation for the cause of my symptoms.

I have been quite sexually active in the past, but have not had any sexual encounters since May 13th (it is now august 9th). in february of this year I started to feel an inconsistent burning in and around my vaginal opening, as well as thick white discharge after being with a partner. worried about STIs i went to get tested at a clinic, and was told it was yeast. The yeast treatment did work, but only for about two weeks, when after having another partner, the symptoms came back. this time the burning was more intense, and accompanied by itching...due to how busy i was with school i was unable to get tested again until the end of May...the burning and itching continued over this entire time but was very on and off (some days it was there, some days it wasnt).  When i was tested this time, yeast, BV, chlamydia, and gonnoreha were all negative..and my (family) doctor said it could just be yeast that didnt show up on the culture. So i did the treatment, and it didnt work. throughout June and July i have had this on and off burning, pain and itching...and it is seeming to get worse. Now it is august and i am experiencing burning, itching, stabbing pain, throbbing, and even pain that feels like my vagina is being pricked with a pin. and there is some inflammation inside. (these feelings are still on and off, some times more intense than others). I still have a lot of thick white discharge, some days more than others. I feel it every day, and every day is a different type of irritation, there are just periods of relief throughout the day (which is what i now mean by on and off, instead of breaks between days) The irritation at this intensity has been going on for about two weeks now. I went to see a third doctor - at a different STI clinic who told me it had to be yeast, but once again the test came back negative. but for some reason she is still convinced? and so AGAIN i am being tested for yeast because she is ""certain"" it is not herpes, or anything of the sort.  but i am not convinced. Could these be signs of atypical herpes?  i have researched about vulvodynia, cytolytic vaginosis, and other things but I cant get the thought of having herpes out of my mind.

I'm about 100 pounds overweight so right there I know there are issues. I have the start of pre-diabetes as well. Plus a back injury from a car accident over a year ago I'm currently going to physical therapy for as it's created a sciatic issue. Now that you know that part of it, here is my issue.  Even being WAY overweight I've never had a blood pressure issue. Even at 120lbs my heart rate was resting in the 100-120 range. They could never tell me why. That hasn't changed. Other than having slighly high sugar, a full blood panel last month came back normal. I'm now back to exercising daily and eating well. I've lost 20 pounds in about a month. It's coming off very slowly, but I want to do it the right way and keep it off. (I gained 120lbs in 3 years) I'm watching sugar and salt as well as the bad fats. It's just a lifestyle change, nothing out of the ordinary. I don't count calories or cut out any foods. I'm just making smarter choices on what I put into my body. Anyway, my blood pressure suddenly is off the chart (for me). When I go out with my kids or go shopping I can always tell because I get stabbing headaches and tingling and numbness on the left side of my face. I don't know if that is a symptom or not. But it always goes hand in hand with my blood pressure going into the 150-160/100-110 range. At first I thought it was back pain causing it. But now with all the exercise that pain is dying down. Then I thought maybe it was blood sugar, but I've tracked it cafefully and it is pretty normal at this point. But the head keeps getting worse and nothing takes care of it. My husband almost took me into the ER this past weekend for it. I was miserable, tired, dizzy, nauseous and had major head pain after spending the day with my family at a museum. (Walking WAY more than I should have.) I had put it off until today when I finally realized when my blood pressure spikes, I feel miserable. I know the lifestyle change is a no-option deal right now. I have to get the weight off and get healthy. But I can't be debilitated when my pressure goes up. Heck, I don't want it going that high, period. Until I get where I need to be, I need a temporary solution. I'm calling my doctor when they open again next week. But is there anything I can do for the meantime to try to lower it just enough so I feel well? I'll go on meds if the doctor wants me to, but I'm hoping someone might know of something to keep it slightly down until that point. Any help is appreciated.

The only thing that came back wrong was a low white blood cell count. So for the next month, my family care doctor ordered three more CBC tests, along with a SED Rate test, Peripheral Smear (immaturity not observed), CRP C-REACTIVE PROTEIN, Parvovirus, IRON AND TBC, HIV, HEPATITIS PANEL ACUTE, EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS, and COMP METABOLIC PANEL blood tests. Everything was normal and good except that my white blood cell count values were low from 2.8-3.8 during that time, a high monocyte percentage of 11.8, and it was noted I have bilirubinemia. Through much of October and early November my symptoms went away again except for the fatigue but now I am experiencing much of the same symptoms again. As of last week I was referred to a hematologist and he took my blood in four or five tubes. I go back in mid-December to see what he says. The hematologist also asked me to go to a gi doctor while I wait so I did today. My gastrointestinal doctor said it was mostly out of his hands because all my blood tests only show a low white blood cell count. So, he put me on two medicines to help me use the restroom (#2) more frequently. Could anyone lead me to possible causes of the low white blood cell count with the stomach/abdominal pain and the fatigue? I am quite nervous about what it could be because at this point I have no clue. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!",

Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/32910/expanding-food-intolerances,Expanding Food Intolerances,"I am a 51 y/o WM and have been struggling for years with stomach pain. A few years ago I traced my issue down to intolerance to certain foods - especially nuts, chocolate, and berries. By eliminating these foods from my diet I achieved a significant level of relief. But lately the pain has returned and I haven't been able to determine what is causing it, nor to find any link between my food intolerances. I have spoken to my doctor and he doesn't have any theory or suggestions. It began with sunflower seeds. The second food to manifest was spearmint leaves - spearmint was, by far, the worst, causing acute debilitating pain. Next was blackberries, then peanuts, chocolate, and strawberries. At this time, I could still eat tree nuts, cranberries, and blueberries, but I had to eventually mark each one off the list - the last two to go were cashews, brazil nuts, and cranberries.  Having eliminated all these from my diet, I experienced several years mostly pain free. However, last year I added cherries to the list, and earlier this year I noticed increased discomfort after eating bananas. Next was green cabbage.  Related foods that I can eat - lettuce, napa cabbage, apples, plums, grapes, bread and grains, melons, legumes, asparagus, avocado, tomato, root vegetables, pineapple, citrus.  This week the old pain level has returned. I have not changed my diet, so it is something I have always been able to eat, and just like with the other foods, the change is sudden. I have no other symptoms, such as diarrhea or gas. The pain itself is caused by swelling - I can see the difference in size of my stomach when the pain is on me, and when the pain passes, the swelling passes, too. I worry that I can't keep eliminating foods from my diet as I will eventually reach a point where I won't be able to eat a balanced diet. I would like to find a cause and treatment, but the whole thing seems so bizarre, I wonder if that's even possible.",

I am a 24-year old male and about a week after Thanksgiving, I started to get this pain behind my left breast and in the rib cage area underneath the breast itself. Anyways, I really started to notice the pain especially when I breathed in or either put my arm up, raised it above my head, or put my arms in front of my body. The pain would really hurt around the left breast when I made those movements. In addition, I started to develop stomach symptoms such as burning in the stomach, cramping, diarrhea, and pain in the side of the abdomen as well as in the kidney area. After trying out a round of antibiotics, the pain was still there which caused my doctor to prescribe me with two new antibiotics (Ciproflaxcin and Flagyl) which helped to ease the stomach and chest pain for about 10 days.  However, the stomach pain is still there sometimes when I eat certain foods and my doctor recently put me on Zantac and Omeprazole to see if those would work. Besides my Primary Care doctor, I also received a referral to a Gastro doctor who I visited yesterday. The Gastro doctor doesn't believe it is anything serious besides possibly GERD, but I have to stop taking the meds for two weeks in preperation for a H. pylori test. Besides that, the Gastro doctor also wants to conduct a Barium swallow test to ensure that it is nothing major.  While we wait for that, I continue to deal with the chest and rib pain especially behind the left breast extending up into the collarbone and below both breasts in the rib area. Lately, I have noticed that the pain does come and go, but usually is pretty persistent in nature. Ibuprofen seems to help as does hot showers, but it eventually ends up coming back and hurts.  I do have a Subaortic Stenosis heart murmur, which the cardiologist is not concerned about and said to just monitor, and had both an Echocardiogram and EKG done last month. Both of those tests came back normal as did the chest x-ray which came back with no evidence of COPD. I am hoping that this is something muscular related or even Costochondritis and not a major cardiovascular disease or an issue related to my heart murmur. If any of you might know what is causing this, I would appreciate your help. Thank you in advance!","GERD and Heartburn , Ulcers"

Then, it was just non-stop pressure in my stomach. Nothing too bad, mostly felt like gas, and early yesterday morning, it finally went away. I was really happy, in a really good mood. I thought it may have just been something triggered by my end of my menstrual cycle, as something similar happened last month as well. Though, come about 7pm yesterday, I felt that awful feeling in my stomach again and had to excuse myself to the bathroom again. It was still diarrhea, which wasn't surprising, but this but time there was a rather large (maybe the size of a quarter) blotch of white.. slimy stuff on it ? Mucus, perhaps, just incredibly visibly white. Since then, I've felt so incredibly bloated, it feels like I'm going to explode.

Right after he tested positive for syhpilis (less than two weeks after I gave him oral sex), he let me know so I would get treated. I went to the STI clinic and they gave me a shot of penicilin. The nurse and I both think that it's likely that I did not get infected, as I was not in direct contact with my friend's chancre (I never even touched his butt, just his penis). Furthermore, my friend got flu-like symptoms under an hour after his penicilin shot because it was killing all the bacteria. It's been over three hours since I was injected and I don't have any side effects so far. My first question is: is it unsafe to have been injected with penicilin if I wasn't even infected? We may never know if I was or not, but it sounds like a pretty strong medicine, so that's why I'm wondering. My second question: my friend was told not to have sex for 7 days after he got injected. My nurse didn't tell me that but I will abstain anyway. Just wondering if I can masturbate, or should I abstain from that as well? Thank you!",

I noticed these small bumps last night while shaving. I had no idea what they could be and decided to investigate. Aside from their appearance, they are completely painless, and the surrounding area as you can see is not red, cracked, or irritated. There is no individual feel to the bumps and cannot be differentiated from the smooth skin surrounding upon a touch. I am not experiencing any of the ""flu-like"" symptoms commonly known for herpes either or any occurring pain. I had scratched one or two, with alcohol and soap readily available, and noticed that it was 50/50 blood and clear fluid. The bumps are all less than 2mm in diameter and appear quite sporadically aside from the one cluster of about 7. The last time I had sex was about 10 days before the discovery, and condoms were used. This was the 6th person I had sex with in my life, and each time protection was used. I am wondering your thoughts on what this could be and plan to get tested anyway soon.

Heart Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/2965/chest-breast-and-rib-pain,"Chest, Breast, and Rib Pain","Hi everyone! I am a 24-year old male and about a week after Thanksgiving, I started to get this pain behind my left breast and in the rib cage area underneath the breast itself. Anyways, I really started to notice the pain especially when I breathed in or either put my arm up, raised it above my head, or put my arms in front of my body. The pain would really hurt around the left breast when I made those movements. In addition, I started to develop stomach symptoms such as burning in the stomach, cramping, diarrhea, and pain in the side of the abdomen as well as in the kidney area. After trying out a round of antibiotics, the pain was still there which caused my doctor to prescribe me with two new antibiotics (Ciproflaxcin and Flagyl) which helped to ease the stomach and chest pain for about 10 days.  However, the stomach pain is still there sometimes when I eat certain foods and my doctor recently put me on Zantac and Omeprazole to see if those would work. Besides my Primary Care doctor, I also received a referral to a Gastro doctor who I visited yesterday. The Gastro doctor doesn't believe it is anything serious besides possibly GERD, but I have to stop taking the meds for two weeks in preperation for a H. pylori test. Besides that, the Gastro doctor also wants to conduct a Barium swallow test to ensure that it is nothing major.  While we wait for that, I continue to deal with the chest and rib pain especially behind the left breast extending up into the collarbone and below both breasts in the rib area. Lately, I have noticed that the pain does come and go, but usually is pretty persistent in nature. Ibuprofen seems to help as does hot showers, but it eventually ends up coming back and hurts.  I do have a Subaortic Stenosis heart murmur, which the cardiologist is not concerned about and said to just monitor, and had both an Echocardiogram and EKG done last month. Both of those tests came back normal as did the chest x-ray which came back with no evidence of COPD. I am hoping that this is something muscular related or even Costochondritis and not a major cardiovascular disease or an issue related to my heart murmur. If any of you might know what is causing this, I would appreciate your help. Thank you in advance!",

What are the benefits and risk factors of taking Fludrocort 1 mg. Daily (60 count) after 2 1/2 month prior heart attack and triple bypass. I'm a 70 y/o woman, 5 foot, 4 inches height, & weigh 120. My heart surgeon & cardiologist are concerned about my low weight, and can't seem to gain even with good appetite. I have a history of non-seizure passing out spells lasting from minutes to a few hours. I've had testing for all types of seizure in 8 hospitals as inpatient & 2 outpatient. A cause has not been found. Cardiologist now thinks the heart attack might be cause, due to decreased blood flow. Yet I did pass out three days ago for first time since HA but says my very low BP (April 74/50) could still decrease blood flow. They couldn't get it to go up except when I was in severe pain; at one time spiked to 180/110, which went back down quickly after pain decreasing. I have history of severe Restless Leg Syndrome extending into feet, toes, arms & fingers, yet usually just at night & mostly controlled with Requip. I have had 4 back surgeries, & use fentanyl pain patch 100meq for chronic pain, & no other pain meds. I'm extremely careful to follow directions completely with this & other meds, even keeping a personal charting system for at home use with names, times meds given, along with vital signs & follow up affects, weekly weight, etc. I follow my heart diet very carefully, have never used tobacco products, no alcoholic usuage ever, & no type street drugs or abused prescriptions. Although small, I've never been overweight.  & ate basically healthy even before my health problems. I've had 3 healthy pregnancies. Never really been sickly except for migraines & what I've already named. I have an older brother who had a Heart attack at age 30, shortly after a 5 year Air Force stay in Vietnam Nam. He was a heavy smoker until his first heart attack. He's had 3, then lived on a battery heart for over a year, then had a heart transplant after which he lived 13 years, & heart still good, but died from kidney failure. No heart problems from my mother's side, & my dad died at age 54 in 1964, from perforated ulcers which caused his stomach to burst. He had 6 surgeries in 5 months, & we didn't know it until we got autopsy report, but he was diabetic, which was I'm sure why his sutures never healed, & everything he ate, came directly out onto his chest from surgical site. His family died early on, before I was born, & we never knew anything about his family health issues. I also had 3 other siblings who died from cancer, 1 breast & lung, & 2 prostate ca, & skin ca. 2 were diabetic. I am considering getting a DNA to see what I can learn about possible family health & risk factors, esp since I now have 3 grandchildren, & 3 great grands.  I saw my primary physician today for my monthly prescriptions. My heart team gave my primary dr full control of my medications after end of first month post HA & surgery. He prescribed the Fludrocort, but other than for decreased BP didn't explain. I read on it, & very concerned about the side effects & found nothing about its use that close to a major HA, & bypass surgery. I called the dr back just to be told that shortly he had been called out of town for a family emergency. I did call my cardiologist, but did not get a return call.  I'm just concerned about about the risk factors before starting a med I'm not familiar with. I apologize this has been so long, but wasn't sure what was important & not.  Thank you so very much. I frequently read from Web MD, but this is the first time I've had questions. I am a retired nurse (LVN) & worked in geriatrics. I find more & more frequently that I have to refresh my mind about medical issues.

All of the tests came back normal, blood work was excellent. The week after I ended up in urgent care and then the emergency room for feeling the same way but I recorded a BP measure of 164/94.

My testicles have become small, soft and sensitive to touch. I have little to no desire for sex and I don't really get erections except occasionally, mostly in the morning. I feel numb down there most of the time especially when I'm not at home and might occasionally feel sexually aroused but it's not really all that intense and dies out soon. I'm currently studying at a university and I really don't have much motivation to study on time and to generally do things I should do on time, on time. I keep stalling and delaying what I should do simply because of a severe lack of motivation and a feeling of apprehension. I feel fatigued and lazy all the time. I also have a lack of self confidence about certain things which makes me on edge when someone points out something negative about me.   I pretend to be interested in girls when I'm with my friends even though I don't really feel much. Even my family doesn't know about it. I come from a culture where you don't really talk about having a girlfriend or boyfriend publicly even if you do, and if you do most of them refrain from engaging in sex for religious reasons. As such it's not really seen as all that unusual that I don't have a girlfriend. My friends just think I don't really make an effort to get to know a girl because I'm just too scared to approach one but the reality is very different. My family just thinks I'm being a ""good boy"".  I was pretty into girls and thinking about sex when I was 13-16. Something happened when I was 16 and I lost interest and then from that point onward my testicles became smaller and softer and now I'm 21... I really need some advice here on what I should do at this point. I'm really confused and worried. I've taken 5 years because the thought of bringing up something like to someone even to family especially in my country would be horribly embarrassing. My family really loves me and I love them but this is too much... I was hoping it would get better in the future but it hasn't now I really don't know what I should do... Thanks.",Men's Issues

I underwent two tests- a 24 hr Holter monitor that came back normal, and a transthoracic echocardiogram which came back totally normal except for the Grade I PAVM).  Knowing that I have this makes me rather anxious, though my cardiologist and primary care physician said its really nothing to worry about. I was told it was possible to correct this (through some sort of coil embolization) but its not worth it. How dangerous are Grade I PAVMs in general? Is it possible for me to experience symptoms as a result of the PAVM? I sometimes get panic attacks and can't distinguish between serious symptoms and anxiety (which makes my heart race). I've had good heart health for my entire life (at least as far as I know- I'm able to do strenuous aerobic exercise, for example).  I was also wondering what the opinion is (if any exits) regarding the safety of using alcohol and cannabis while having a PAVM. The cold medicine I took that resulted in arrhythmia is a vasoconstrictor, whereas cannabis is a vasodilator that lowers blood pressure (my blood pressure is around 107/65 mmHg). There is one time I recall feeling my heart race after smoking cannabis, but I don't know if that was anxiety or the drug. Though it is embarrassing for me to admit, I ended up going to the ER, where they initially said (if memory serves) that I had mild AFib symptoms, but after a subsequent check said I was fine (and I felt fine after around an hour).  Thanks in advance for your insights.","AFib , Heart Disease"

Assuming a healthy digestive system and stronger immunity, helping us to fight against infections and protecting us when we take antibiotics are only a few benefits that these tiny little bacteria can give to us. The world health organization defined probiotics as: “Probiotics are microorganisms that give many benefits to our body when they are consumed in proper amounts.”  The digestive tube is the place where acts our intestinal flora, intestinal mucosa, and immune system. Inside our digestive system, it works 24 h from 24 h over 100.000 milliards bacteria. That`s why our body manages to digest what we eat, synthesizes the vitamins and other nutritive substance. Things like stress, unhealthy alimentation, antibiotics treatment can cause an imbalance to our intestinal flora, and this thing has a serious impact on our health leading to repeated infections, acne, mycosis, digestive disorders (diarrhea, constipation), fatigue and depression. And what`s the solution to all these? Probiotics are the friendly bacteria that rebalance our intestinal flora and bring the feeling of wellbeing.  Our intestinal flora has many physiological functions, assuring a healthy life. Helps digesting the food helps to synthesize certain vitamins, feeds our intestinal mucosa and helps it, has an essential role in protecting our body because it acts like a protective wall which won`t let bad bacteria affect our body. When our intestinal flora is unbalanced, the good bacteria can`t work properly anymore. In this situation, to rebalance our intestinal flora is necessary a nutritive supplement based on probiotics. Probiotics help the wall to become stronger and to fight better against the bad bacteria. Probiotics also favor the multiplication of probiotics, and so no bad bacteria will have a place. So here are the essential rules when you choose a probiotic: It is recommended that probiotics should be taken in the form of supplements. To be sure that you have selected the most efficient probiotic make sure to follow those tips: 1. Choose a product that contains a sufficient quantity of probiotics so that it has the effect you expected. More precisely, be aware of the number of CFUs used in the supplement you take. .2 Make sure that the bacteria are conserved in a safe method and that they remain alive. In this way, they will have better results in your body. 3. void seasonal infections make sure you take a proper amount of probiotics daily.",

Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/13160/anxiety-bloating,Anxiety & Bloating?,"Hey! I'm trying to figure out the cause for my bloating. I'm a 32yo male, 67 kg in fairly decent health, I did smoke for 13 years and drank a fair amount when I went out 2 or 3 times a month. I'll try to give as much info as possible here below: Diet wise is good now. I've always been able to eat anything and have remained at 65-68kg regardless of what I ate. I was travelling in Asia for the past 14 months but have now been in Australia for the past 3. The past 6 months I have noticed bloating in my lower gut, front side all around where my belly button is. The first time I noticed it was in Asia and I put it down to drinking beer more regularly. The one and only time I had an actual reactive episode to food was around 5 months ago when I went to a good Italian restaurant and had pasta. Not a huge portion but within half an hour I thought I was going to explode. I have seemingly zero fat on me and my abdomen was bulging insanely. My gut area inflamed so much that I ended up being sick and having diarrhoea through the night. That led me to believe it was maybe a gluten intolerance so from then on I cut gluten out of my diet. But the bloating didn't really go away and I re-introduced gluten to my diet. That made zero difference to anything.  It generally gets worse at night but it is present in the morning still. I have no other physical symptoms present.  The only other thing I think it could be is due to stress and anxiety. On the face of it I feel happy, I'm always mentally aware of where I am in life and I'm good at making corrections in my thinking if need be. The first time an anxiety attack hit me properly was around 24 hours after finishing drinking during a hangover. It was a full on panic attack- tight chest the feeling of impending doom/ I was having a heart attack. I wasn't sure the cause at the time and then a similar thing happened a few months later and then became more frequent. It only happened on big nights of prolonged drinking. I'm a social drinker and the average week I drink nothing at all - a few units if anything. But when I go out for a big night, I drink a lot. 20-35 units in a single night. Although big drinking was rare, I've cut back further and only drank clean good alcohol.  The panic attacks/anxiety started to play a part in my everyday life. They were never full on attacks, more of a constant feeling and still always that tightness in the chest like my heart was failing. I read up heavily on the subject and started doing yoga and meditating daily. I also had a more fight than flight attitude mentally when confronting the anxiety which helped. So relaxing but also being firm in my thoughts definitely helps and the anxiety and tightness in the chest has largely disappeared.  But the bloating is still there. I should add I had a similar thing a few years ago. Never a panic attack but I was convinced there was a small hard lump in the centre left of my chest. Doctors then put it down to stress as I was cleared of anything else. They didn't give any explanation to how stress can manifest itself into seemingly real physical symptoms and really didn't take anything seriously at all. I'm by no means a hypochondriac but I'm fully aware how powerful the mind - conscious and subconscious can be. That's why I've taken the approach to my anxiety now. I eliminated certain foods to reduce the bloating but to no result - maybe I need to do it for longer and try different diets?  I'm thinking it might still be a stress thing. I'm a self employed travel photographer - I'm quite hard on myself as the market is a tough one. I love working and do so all the time without sacrificing my own happiness. At least that's what I think I'm doing.  So does anyone have thoughts on anxiety and bloating? Are there ways to reduce the physical symptoms of the bloating itself? Like I said, I'm fairly active. My diet is pretty good and balanced. No other symptoms present. I drink plenty of water everyday.  I'm asking here first as I am still travelling so going to a doctor overseas can be complicated and costly.  And input would be appreciated. Thanks","Irritable Bowel Syndrome , Bloating"

It still responds to exercise and when I get excited but it doesn't beat out of my chest like it used to. Feels like its deep down in my chest. I ran 2 miles the other day and my pulse was high and I could feel my heart beating but only if I put my hand to my chest. This has been for about a month.

Whoever is out there that can answer my questions. I am posting this on multiple websites.  It all started on Sept 30th, 2017. I went out with my family for a birthday dinner. My life was completely turned upside down that night. I was eating like normal and I accidentally took a whole shrimp into my mouth. I chewed it twice and swallowed it way too fast. There was no shell on it and it wasn’t a mini shrimp. I swallowed it whole because I was eating too fast. All of the sudden, I felt weird. The shrimp was traveling down my throat very uncomfortably and I thought it went down my air pipe. I thought I was choking and I started sweating like crazy. I started hyperventilating and had the worst chest pressure that made me feel like I couldn’t breathe. I thought I was going to die, I thought I could be having a heart attack. My family thought I had a panic attack. After I calmed down, I realized I could breathe but I couldn’t take deep breaths or yawn normally. I tried eating again but I started to get panicky sweats again and got very scared. I had the feeling there was food stuck in my throat and chest. (I’ve never had panic attacks before in my life). That night, I have never been the same. It is now Nov. 9th, 2017. The week after my panic attack, my throat felt smaller and I had troubling swallowing food or drinks. Every time I ate food, it felt like it got stuck in my chest, no matter what I ate. I starting eating a lot less, like 2500 calories a day to less than 1000. The night I had a panic attack, I slept like I usually did but I had a hard time breathing normally. I didn’t get much sleep. Every other night after, I had terrible pain in my upper rib cages right below both breasts. I couldn’t breathe still. I went to patient first and told them everything. I got an EKG, blood tests, Chest and throat X rays, everything was normal. Nothing got stuck in my throat. Nothing was wrong. They thought I might of have acid reflux or GERD. They told me to take a drug store antacid like Mylanta. I took it a couple of times. I was having so much pain that week after the incident that I went to the ER as well. They did all the same tests and didn’t find anything wrong. I told them everything and they said it was probably GERD or acid reflux. They gave me a GI cocktail to help relieve some pain. It didn’t do much for me and my breathing was still not normal. I went to an ENT and he stuck a camera down my throat and said nothing was there. I went to a GI specialist after and got an endoscopy. The endoscopy was normal. The doctor said I couldn’t rule out acid reflux though, even though there was no sign of damage to my esophagus. He prescribed me some antacid medicine. I never took it. I went to another GI specialist for a second opinion, she told me all the tests they could do and I did a barium swallow. That test turned out completely normal too. They did an ultrasound of everything with my digestive system and didn’t find a single problem. I started to feel better after that awful week and tried eating more and more solid foods. The week after the panic attack I drank a lot of ensure. I slept that whole week propped up too. The week after the ribcage pain went away. I think it was because I wasn’t eating a lot. When I started eating almost normally again, I felt way better but I couldn’t breathe still and I still had trouble swallowing. It doesn’t really matter what food I eat, when I eat or drink anything, it feels like it puts pressure on my lungs or something. The chest pressure and breathing have gotten way worst in some moments. After a day of eating receses candy and ham and veggies, I got this burning sensation near my left breast in between my chest. After that day, I got a sore throat. Eventually I had a fever that lasted two days and turned into a cold. I think it might of started a week or two ago but now I have no appetite at all. I kinda always feel full and I have a cough leftover from the cold. I hear squeaking noises when I breathe inward. The left side of my stomach makes a weird short fart noise occasionally. I have gargling noises that come from a different part of my stomach too. I started taking a medicine the second GI doctor prescribed, pantoprazole 20 mg twice a day. I’ve been taking it for two weeks now. Sometimes when I eat food, I feel like I have to burp but I don’t and it feels like liquid comes up. I burp constantly whenever I eat anything or drink. I’VE ONLY HAVE BURNING SENSATIONS THREE TIMES MAX. The liquid feeling coming up never burns, it just worsens the breathing. I’ve woken up at night three different times feeling like I swallowed something and it got stuck in my throat. In my head I thought I was wearing a mask, and I swallowed it (I don’t even own any mask).How do I know this is acid reflux and why do I not feel hungry anymore? I never can eat much because I have trouble swallowing and it feels like my life is falling apart. Someone please help me. I’m losing hope. I need help. I can’t do anything normally anymore. I can’t tell If what im eating is hurting me, I cant breathe right, I cant exercise like I use too because I don’t eat enough. I am only 20 years old and 120 pounds. Life is awful. I’ve tried Xanax as well, it did not help with anything. I have to eat all food by grinding up almost to a liquid in my mouth. My chest pressure has never let up since that terrible day. What is happening to me? Btw when I take hard steps or jump off something, the front upper part of my teeth hurt really bad. I read that may be because they are connected to my sinuses or something? I am allergic to sulfur drugs and I have celiac disease. I’ve had it since I was 17. I do not eat gluten ever. I have never experienced any of this in my life. Can that onset event trigger acid reflux all of the sudden???",GERD and Heartburn

I have a very active lifestyle, which includes weekly cycling or hiking and daily 30-60 min exercise consisting of aerobic and strength training. My diet is very low fat vegetarian and nearly vegan (very occasional cheese or egg as a “treat”). Despite my good diet, my cholesterol is a little over 230, so I am one of those unlucky people with naturally high cholesterol. According to my cardiologist if I hadn’t been following my current diet since ~1987, I probably wouldn’t be here to write this now. Starting last year I starting getting an intense pain in my chest along my sternum/esophagus during very intense exercise (i.e. hiking up a steep mountain, cycling up a big hill, etc). A key observation, I think, is that the pain goes away as soon as I stop or the mountain/hill becomes less steep. I also feel this symptom while climbing a few flights of stairs with a full stomach. The chest pain is often accompanied by moderate dizziness and disorientation and occasionally includes pain down my left arm. This last part led me to consult my cardiologist who immediately recommended I get a stress echocardiogram and a cardiac catheterization, both of which showed no issues. Given a strong family history of GERD, which can also apparently cause chest pain, I was also referred to a gastroenterologist who recommended an upper endoscopy to look for damage to my esophagus; however, this test also showed no signs of a problem.  I have now been diagnosed with “cardiac small vessel disease” since my main cardiac arteries are clear, but all that I have read indicates that this condition is not necessarily tied to exercise, but rather results in general fatigue, and is more common in women (of which I am not). I am now taking blood pressure, cholesterol lowering and stomach acid reduction med’s, but I am still symptomatic. I believe the key features of this syndrome are (1) chest pain during very intense exercise, (2) immediate relief of the pain when I moderate the intensity of the exercise and (3) the occurrence of similar symptoms climbing a flight of stairs with a full stomach.

Thank you in advance. I am a man who is considering dating and potentially having sex with a woman who has cerebral palsy and HSV-1/Cold Sore. Some backstory on my potential partner:  As I understand it, I believe it is not her fault and she was born that way. Basically when her mother was pregnant with her and was really sick, her mother had a cold sore and as a result, her mother was forced to give birth to her very prematurely. In the process, she apparently contracted HSV-1 from her mother at birth because of the cold sore. So she had some sort of neonatal herpes. So with what in mind, what I want to know is this: If I have VAGINAL intercourse/sex with her, is it possible for me to get HSV-1 even though she does not have genital herpes and only has HSV-1/Cold Sore? She does not have sex during a breakout, which is rare for her and as far as I know. She takes medicine for herpes, but I am not sure which kind as I did not ask. Before you answer, please read and consider this in order to give me a very accurate answer:  We will NOT be having any oral sex of any kind. Strictly vaginal. She does not have genital herpes. So there will be no spread from her mouth to my penis. But even though she does not have herpes in or near her genitals, is there still a chance I can contract HSV-1 from her? I am aware of safe sex practices, but I would like to have vaginal sex without a condom if at all possible. Is this possible? I have researched and googled HSV-1/herpes, but no material at all covers whether or not you can safely have vaginal sex if a woman only has HSV-1/cold sore and when there will be no oral sex at all.

I was sexually abused as a child/adolescent by the person who was my pediatrician as well as other individuals. *Warning: semi graphic information ahead* My sophomore year in high school, I had symptoms which when you look at the whole constellation of them could lead you to believe I was pregnant. Because of who one of my abusers was it was not uncommon for things to happen to me that very well could have resulted in a termination of a pregnancy without my being involved or knowing.  Only one memory exists which might have some bearing on that. I would have been only 15 and immature for my age so understand that I am only able to describe this through a child's perception. I was held down or restrained in some way. It was in his ""office"" which was in a private house and I never knew nurse's worked in places other than the school until I was way older than a normal kid because he didn't have one. My legs were being held spread wide open and I remember my hips hurt. He had a whole bunch of what I remember as metal sticks of all different sizes on a towel. He kept sticking them in me and there was terrible pain and my stomach hurt. I vomited at one point because it hurt so much and I was crying so hard. I don't remember much after that because I think I either passed out or dissociated. This would have been 1987.  I do not know what this episode was. If it was just more of the sadistic abuse which had in the past involved foreign objects. It is the most painful physically episode I remember. It is one of the last times he touched me. I escaped to college in just 2 years, early. But, I do not want to allow a false memory to be given to me just because something seems like it might be. So, my question is . . . Can my obgyn somehow during my exam tell if I was pregnant in the past? If not, do you think if I were to describe all my symptoms from back then to her along with the episode I desciped here - could I trust her opinion on what happened? I need to resolve this and I can't take the suspicion of a therapist with no medical knowledge. To be able to let it go or to face it, I need to hear the opinion from someone with better background to make that call. Especially since I have some medical training myself. Btw: my obgyn is an amazing person. She knows I have a difficult history. She sees me regularly just to check in. She is a big support. So, I know I can trust whatever she says.",Women's Issues

Right after my shower, I looked at it again and it became bigger and very white (as if it had never scabbed) it was not flat and ""pearly"" but more raised, bumpy and uneven. The reason i am so confused is that over the past two days i have been constantly looking at the bump, and every time it looks different. It looks the same as described above after i shower, then it'll look scabby, then it'll be more of a tiny dot of white, then back to the bigger white bump after a shower, etc. I have not had any sexual interactions for about 45 days, but have been quite sexually active in the past.

No GERD, no bloating, no consistent diarrhea or constipation, no food allergies, etc. CURENT STATE I am at my wits end. I've seen three doctors to get a fresh look at the case and none have any answers. I just want to diagnose the cause of the tenderness. Stomach tenderness is said to be a medical emergency, mine is not, obviously and yet its a significant reduction in my quality of life. I do have some herniated discs in my thoracic region from old football injuries, but when those hurt, its a very specific pain which I have not had to deal with in many years. This stomach pain comes from the front and does not radiate into the back at all. My spine is not tender to touch as it is when I am injured. I am considered obese, though I am quite active and healthy otherwise. I weight 240 and am 5'10"" tall. I do not smoke, I do not eat red meat, consume alcohol, or any other drugs of any kind, legal or not. QUESTIONS Is there any other bacteria I should be tested for?  What are other possible sources of this tenderness?  Any tests that are not listed that I should try?",

The ENT Doctor said I've had trouble swallowing because I said everytime I swallow a pill it feels like i'm choking. I have Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy so I go to a speciality clinic for my disease. Me and my mom asked my pulmonologist that comes in the room as well as a few other doctors about what has happened, so they gave us this rescue inhaler with a spacer because they thought it was asthma related. But that hasn't helped at all, so the ENT Doc went ahead and got me to do a barium swallow test and that doctor that did that procedure said it's probably Acid Reflux.  My symptoms so far have been sore/burning throat, mucus that keeps producing, wheezing, and abdominal pain. When I have bad coughing spells I usually throw up, gag, and burp. My chest/stomach usually hurts bad when I get those bad spells. I've been trying to take tums before every meal and it helps until an hour after eating.  The surgeries/Hospital visits i've had in the past have been constipation, pneumonia that led me to wear a bipap mask at night, a spinal infusion, feeding tube/g-tube mickey button.

So I've been in a relationship for over 9 with the same women we have kids blah blah blah my problem is first I'm very sexual and she not now it used to be different we've both done our fair share of hurting and lying. We've had an open relationship and it was ok. I've had a lot of sex obviously so it's gotten to the point now instead of a few times a day then it went once a day now I'm lucky if it's every 4 days. Unfortunately for me i was not blessed with a huge package but it's not tiny either. So I've noticed that when we don't have sex for a few days she is normally tighter and sometimes she is not. I know all the muscle and medical blah I'm saying that this is bad for me I'm sure due to one guy she messd with when she got home I could tell immediately that dude was hung like a bull. So I know for a fact in my own experience that if someone bigger than me has been her it's different so that being said I'm pretty sure of even 2 days of not having sex she should be tighter and always has been so we have our open relationship and she should not be going behind my back. She says she's not but damn I gotta beg her to get laid Is he don't kiss me anymore don't look at me when we do have sex always has her eyes closed sometimes is even on her phone. I as and I get told I'm crazy and paranoid she's always on her damn phone has Instagram facebook and Snapchat with all kinds of dudes. She tells me it's because were busy and a bunch of what I consider b.s. I understand our busy lives but I'm always trying to give her love and affection I always make time I love her a lot and want believe she's not but what am I supposed to think? I know this long and if your still reading this thanks. I don't go through her phone because all but facebook don't store messages no point evidence gone. I did recently and noticed she has had a secret Yahoo email. Also she used to text me a lot and now I barely get anything she is super busy but I can't even get a simple ily text back. She always gets defensive and tells me I'm paranoid crazy. This has been going on for awhile and I'm going nuts has anyone gone through this is am I crazy?

Bad circumcision?,"Hello all,  I'm a 47 yr old male. I've had big problems with sex from my earliest experiences with it. I recently read a description of the possible bad side effects of circumcision and they mirrored my experience very well.  - I get erections very easily.  - The sensation of rubbing the shaft feels very good, but doesn't really stimulate the build up to orgasm.  - The head and the frenulum can feel good, but often begin to get painful or numb quickly.  - The ridge behind the head of the penis is very sensitive and rubbing it is how I get to orgasm (if I can.) But there are points on my penis that get very painful from this stimulation even if I use a lot of lube and rub very gently.  - There is a strange ""inversion"" feeling that happens often. I'll get closer and closer to orgasm and it inverts. It goes away. The build up kind of shoots into my gonads or gut without release and feels really uncomfortable. The penis is really sensitive at this point and usually painful. If I carefully rub the areas that don't hurt too much I can usually get to orgasm. But sometimes this 'inversion' will happen 2, 3, or 4 times. The effect is to really, really want to have an orgasm, but more and more discomfort, pain, and acidlike burning to get there.  - Orgasms don't feel good. They are painful, they often burn or I feel nothing at all. Many times I could not tell if I had and orgasm or not.  - It often takes a long time to get to orgasm. In my younger days I'd masturbate for hours sometimes, just trying to get to the release.  - If I compare the sensitivity of the anus to the sensitivity of the head of my penis, I'd say the penis has about 20% of the sensitivity.  - The biggest problem I have is, the more aroused I get, the harder it seems to have an orgasm and the worse it feels. So, being really attracted to someone has the effect of essentially giving me really bad blue balls. To be honest, the lack of enjoyment has left me feeling like I've had blue balls for 35 years. I've gone as long as 12 years between sexual partners, because of the confusion this has caused. It's not that I don't want to have sex. I do, the drive is there. Spring time is here and I'll be seeing women out on the street in less clothing. I have desire, but the sex is so uncomfortable and I get no satisfaction out of it, that most of the time it's better to pretend sex doesn't exist rather than feel the discomfort. I've had few partners. And the ones I've had get discouraged because I never come. Like 7 month relationships without an orgasm. Certainly brings up questions of ""Are you really attracted to me?"", for both of us.  Thanks",Men's Issues

It lasted for like 2 minutes. I also shaved my penis and balls right before the encounter. He said he was STD free and I didn't see any signs of him having STDs. It was the dumbest thing i've ever done. That's my only sexual encounter of my whole life. As soon as i got home from this encounter I rubbed a waterless antiseptic foam on my penis and balls pretty roughly. This antiseptic contains 62% ethyl alcohol by the way. After doing that I scrubbed my penis and balls somewhat roughly with a bar of soap and water. I didn't take a shower and didn't wash away the soap as best as i could, but i rinsed the area with water until there was barely any soap visible, then i headed to sleep.  There hasn't been any pain when i pee, However, I did ejaculate once and it was slightly painful. And after that ejaculation, which was a couple hours ago, I've been feeling a weird sensation in my urethra. After the ejaculation my pee does feel very slightly stingy, but barely anything from normal. If I don't think about it, I can make the pain mostly go away. My testicles do not hurt at all and are not swollen. I don't have any puss coming out of my penis and i don't have any sores/blisters/warts. But, I am an incredibly paranoid and anxious person, so I've been freaking out that I have herpes or some STD. I'm going to wait two weeks from the day I had the encounter to get tested. But in the meantime I am so insanely paranoid that I have been using hand sanitizer obsessively after touching anything that's been near my junk, including clothes and towels, etc. The irritation is tolerable, however the anxiety is bad. I looked up the effects of antiseptic on penises and it said it could cause penis irritation or even Chemical urethritis. I know the very slight irritation can be because of the antiseptic or an STD, so i will have to wait to be tested first. My question is do I have to wash my hands after touching my penis every single time? I;m worried if i don't i could spread HPV or and STD to other areas of my body or to my family.

The first sloppily lost blood and urine samples, but when the test was finally completed correctly it came back with borderline HSV1. When I say borderline it was right between positive and negative. I never got an explanation of these numbers as that doctor was too incompetent to follow up or respond to inquiries.  The next physician looked at the same test and decided I needed a swab test. According to new doc, the blood test for HSV was not always reliable in its predictions and a physical swab was the best indicator. The swab came back negative for HSV 1&2.

That would explain all your symptoms; I would however need to dig more into your “ slight fever”. A less- than 38 degree Celsius still fits into the spectrum, but higher values may point to possible latent infection that flares up with waning immune status in company with sex hormones imbalance and a bleeding endometrium, especially if there is local uterine pain.  Stemming from such a pathophysiolgy antidepressant use is of help, evidently keeping in mind your position regarding use of those.

He swares he'll never forget they were the most beautiful shade of dark blue hes still ever seen. Ive got the scar, and matching stories from dozens of family members so i know it happened. But ive always wondered if dad may have been a little bit scared and understandably, a little hollywood about my testicles actually being completely severed and at least for a few hours not attached to me. If he wasnt exaggerating then it means a surgeon in phx, az around 1985 was able to reattach my jewels (cuz they are in their) and since ive got a beautiful 9 year old daughter, reattach them 'right.' i cant imagine thatd be a common fix, right? Or is it? And lastly what if any effect would/could such an injury have on the full development of my testicles and penis? Because, though ive never had any confidence issues, its not exactley all proportional with the rest of my body. And the scar size in the shape of an L or a 7, depending on POV, was definitely a pull it tight and hope it holds job. My scrodem seldom hangs, and 90% of the time is really tightly snug with my body like when its cold, or accidently caught it while zipping up ur pants too fast, if you know what i mean? Does that, this, make any sense as ive told it? Because its the story ive been told for 30 years.",Men's Issues

A few days later it started burning when I urinated and the tip of my penis looked red and irritated. I went to my Dr. and he did an urinalysis that following Wednesday. It came back clean. I then went in the next day Thursday and they took my blood to run all the STD tests there are out there. It came back negative. There is now a small red bump about the size of the end of a writing pen. Does not hurt burn or anything. I went back and he did a swab of the area and sent it to the lab. I'm waiting on the results. Has anyone out there had a similar situation? Does anyone have any idea what this might be? Thank you for the help.,"Chlamydia , HPV/Genital Warts , Men's Issues , Gonorrhea , Genital Herpes"

It starts before or during my period (but not in the last two months.) I get a cough, reduced sense of taste and appetite, diahrea, slight fever, intestinal issues, nausea, and sometimes vomiting. I am considering going on birth control to get rid of the symptoms (hopefully.) No, there is no possibility I am pregnant, this has been going on for longer than 9 months and I'm tiny, plus I never miss a period. This started when I began using a cup instead of tampons. I quickly stopped because I would get sick every period for the first couple days. I chalked it up to pressure on my cervix, and never being able to learn to properly apply the cup. So for pretty much this entire year I have been using tampons again. Recently, my ""flu"" has been much worse, and I've been sick 3 times since September. The symptoms last one to two days max.  I have had giardia, almost 3 years ago. I never got tested after my medicine to see if I was free, but the signature sulfur burps and farts are gone. So is the liquid diahrea that seemed to be undigested food. So I'm pretty sure it's not giardia, but I will get another test done to make sure. I'm tereified it might be something worse. Probably not TSS because I've never needed to be hospitalized. I have not ever had an all inclusive std/i test done, but my paps smears onky ever turn up bacterial infections likely caused by ph imbalances. I drink kefir to help my probiotics. Another posibility is maybe cancer (haha laugh at me all you want, my left tonsil has been swollen for like 5 years, after an episode of strep, the doctors wouldn't take it out because I was too old.) I have no known allergies, and no one in my family is allergic to anything, except my aunt to foods in the broccoli family. I don't have the conviction to keep a food diary, I have tried so many times. I could never say whether the symptoms hapoen after certain foods. I eat grain and dair basically everyday. I've thought maybe a hole in my intestines, but I'm sure sepsis would hospitalize me, so probably not that either. This is VERY long term.

The results say: “Polypoid fibroma with overlying features suggestive of early condyloma acuminatum.” ""Suggestive of early"" is the part that is throwing me off. I interpreted that as it looks like it could be something that might've became a genital wart if I left it. My doctor didn't offer much explanation or clarity when I asked him to elaborate. He said it's vague, so I guess that means it may just be a little benign growth, or it may be HPV. But couldn't they have tested the biopsy for the virus to know for sure? Or is that not something you can identify easily? The only time I've had sex (oral and vaginal) was a few years ago and I used protection. I still don't think it's possible for me to get it, so I'm leaning towards believing that it was just a benign growth not caused by anything.

I have had genital HSV-2 for about 5 years now. Usually I have outbreaks in the same area on my genitals and only once it was in a different spot just slightly lower than I normally get them. The other day I had what I thought was a spider bite on my lower back but it looked very similar to an outbreak. It didnt have the tingling that I usually experience but it was irritated with multiple pus filled blisters very similar to an outbreak. I was just curious about if someone has HSV-2 is it possible for the outbreaks can change locations that much. Usually I have outbreaks on the base of my penis but this is on my lower back above where my underwear is. I cant get into the doctor for another week and I think by then it will already be healed up. Any advice or info?","Men's Issues , Genital Herpes"
Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/29514/with-all-the-hopes-in-the-world,....with all the hopes in the world,"Hi, first let me say hello and introduce myself. I am Chantale, 44 ( soon 45) from Montreal , Canada.  I come to this place, for a hint to something new. Because frankly, i am heading for depression and, i came in Montreal to fulfill my life's purpose.  Since 2013, it's a copy paste. Just to mention that i've seen doctors, specialists, but they never stumbled upon something that could be helpful. I have a very very long term constipation condition. And when i say constipation, it means no natural bowel movement at all. At all.  Before, i used to go to the emergency room to empty my bowels when it was too hard to live with. They were simply emptying me, and sent me home. Years like this. They tried all the possible medication avenue on me, including Resotran ( prucalopride) and food combination. Still, the same. If i am not having an enema, i'm not going. 3 liters of water per day, exercice, healthy eating, and we've been into the no gluten, no lactose, no this and no that, and no changes. Now, for two months, i've stopped going to the emergency room cause i was about to loose my job because of it. They would even send me home very often with a 4 liters of Peglyte ( or Golitely). I was sick for days. I became anorexic because of this, for two years. I would feel like food was just poop that would be stuck, and that i was a *** barrel. Nothing else. My life is all about this. That's a handicap, pure and simple. NOW, what's happening is that, i poop with a suppository. If i don't put it, nothing comes out. No matter how i force, the position, no matter nothing. I don't feel the need to defecate, i don't cramp, it doesn't push. I just know it's time because i get extremely cold, like it's winter inside my body, lightheaded, and passing so much gaz that it's another handicap. Now here is the interesting part. The suppository never even have the time to melt. I insert it and two minutes after, i hurt so bad , i have to go. No pushing. It comes all out, always the same: a veryyyyyyyyy long ""s ""shape smooth poop. So long, you wouldn't believe it was sitting there, right at the door...without knocking. But it is. I have no sensation in my anus when i push, as if it's dead. The suppository just induce the feeling for my anus to expulse because, the feces are right there.  I have to do it like two times a day, to avoid inconfort.  After i expulse, i feel terrible pain all over my body, i ache everywhere. It's like my skin becomes all thin, dry, my bones hurt, i feel soo soo cold....and i can feel the older poop sort of moving down, and that's why i have to insert another 4-5 hours later. Then the same amount of feces comes out.  In a way, i am and should be happy that suppositories replaced enemas. But....i don't feel better. I still feel ill and sick, every single day. I could not take the enemas anymore, it made me suicidal. Before, suppositories would not work. Now they do. The doctors were always impressed by my constipation, especially all located on the right side. And the amount of it. Several pounds. They never forget mentioning me. How a tiny person like me could have so much feces. They made me feel like an animal.  So this morning, i wake up and...im tired of the suppositories. Why is that nothing comes out, and that it's RIGHT THERE? Sitting there, that long thing. It hurts, im cold, tired, feeling weak, the pain in my body is just excruciating. I even have heart palpitations when the feces are moving inside of me, as if they touch my heart. So..why is it that a suppository that doesn't have the time to melt, makes my feces comes out in one split second, to make me feel cold , in pain ( i even had to call off work often because i was too cold or lightheaded to get out) .  My whole life is about that. I'm unhappy, so unhappy. Please someone say something.",Constipation

A little bit of skin is exposed while having sex where my underwear slips or the condom rolls up, where I accept maybe there is an incredibly small percentage of a risk, but what are the risks exactly? The amount of skin exposed would be fractional. 2. No skin is exposed during sex whatsoever, and all three elements (condom, boxers, and underwear) remain intact and unmoved.

Then I felt the same symptoms and had another endoscopy that found ""varises"", varicose veins in the esophagus; the most common cause is cirrhosis of the liver for which the most common cause is excessive alcohol consumption. Since that is not the case for me, the doctor performed several liver biopsies (through the throat!). Nothing's wrong there. Now the thought is that the cause is the Hepatitis (A) that I incurred from eating a Sara Lee Frozen Fish dinner in 1964; the product was taken off the market in subsequent weeks.  We're still at the beginning of what to do about varises....  I will share with doctors your issue - we might be related....Good Luck!",

That is sad but a fact. I have been diagnosed with Chrohns Disease about 4 years ago. I was bleeding profusely from the rectum and bowel movements were up to 38 to 40 times a day. My doctor had put me on infusions of Remicade and that really helped me. I had to go back to work and could not take 4 hours every other Friday for infusions so I stopped. I tried to go holistic. What a mistake. I felt ok for almost 7 months and then wham I was in full blown relapse. I have had some surgery only to remove a mass that was in my intestine. I went back to my doctor begging for forgiveness lol. The one problem with Remicade is once you go off of it you cannot go back on. Your body builds immunity and you can also become allergic to it. For the last 3 months I have been self injecting Humira. It does not seem to work. I have been feeling so sick and eating Immodium like chicklets to get through the work day. For a week now I am lethargic and just feel so ill. I still pushed on through my week. I am so scared and really do not have anyone who really knows what this does to you to talk to. This disease is ruining my life. My doctor knows that I refuse to have the bag on. I told him the only bag they could put on me is a Prada! Mentally and emotionally I just cannot handle it. He hugged me and said he would not give up on me kid... I told him I would rather just die then do that surgery. I know it has helped a lot of people but I just cannot do this. So there is one more infusion therapy I can try but will be missing work which may lead to losing my job. I try the healthy eating and low carbs and tried low lectin diet but my pain and bathroom trips are still not manageable. Does anyone have any advice on what helped them? Humira does not seem to be working. I am exhausted all the time to the point I sleep all weekend because I feel ill.",Crohn's Disease

I bought a 1 day yeast infection kit, and will be taking that tonight.

When i Urinate or have a bowel movement, the pain reoccurs.

A few spots here and there, and for a while the instances were rather far apart. Every few weeks, I'd get a day or two with some splotches of blood on the paper. I wrote it off as being the fault of the paper, or maybe something akin to hemorrhoids. The last two weeks, however, the bleeding has gone from a few splotches to a very highly concerning flow of blood. The paper is almost covered in wet, crimson blood. Twice this week I have had to spend an extra 5-10 minutes on the toilet making sure that I was finished bleeding before exiting the restroom, to avoid getting a not insignificant amount of blood on my underwear. The flow was heavy enough to the point that it was dripping onto the floor whilst I was attempting to examine the issue. I have several other typical symptoms of hemorrhoids, that being soreness/discomfort and itchiness around the effected area alongside the bleeding. I have had difficult bowel movements ever since I was a child, where I would go for days and days at a time without one and then have very uncomfortable and long lasting movements with stools that begin loose and become formless by the end of the ordeal. It is a chronic issue I've never had examined by a medical professional due to it never having caused me any significant issues in the past, and due to the obviously embarrassing nature of the condition. I'm seriously concerned about the level of the bleeding now, however, and am wondering whether or not I should seek medical assistance, or if these are common symptoms of hemorrhoids (something I have never before dealt with) that I can treat myself.

I have celiac disease and a history of anxiety.I take 10mg citalopram for anxiety. I recently traveled to Austria. I flew alone to Munich and the journey was extremely stressful, I had three panic attacks on the way. When I landed I missed my train and had to take a 400 dollar taxi to Innsbruck... basically, a very stressful journey. That night I felt fine but wasn't hungry really. The next morning after light exercise and being out in the sun I started feeling like I had a fever. Though I never took my temperature, I think I had a fever for a day or two. When I got back to the hotel room I felt extremely nauseous yet also starving (I ate nothing on the entire 24ish hour journey). I had panic attack which includes scratching myself, contemplating jumping out the hotel window, etc. Felt like I was about to throw up for hours and hours yet never did. Slept 12-14 hours for the next few nights. Was extremely hungry but whenever I saw food or smelled it I grew extremely nauseous. I expected to throw up many times but never did. Had diarrhea once, then no more bowel movements due to lack of eating. Took Zofran for the nausea twice, helped temporarily and then the nausea came back. I am definitely not pregnant. Took benadryl as well. I then took Valium. Went to a hospital, had an IV for fluids and also had Vomex in the IV bag. Took a flight back to the US (very traumatic, extremely nauseous the entire time, held a barf bag but never threw up) and went to a hospital in the US. Was given fluids. Then saw my therapist and psychiatrist. They told me that from not eating my body went into ""Starvation mode"" and stopped wanting to eat. They said my anxiety was causing the nausea. Forced me to eat, increased the dose of citalopram ( though it takes 3 weeks to kick in) and prescribed valium for panic attack/ extreme nausea, which I took twice but it made me really sleepy and extremely thirsty. Standard blood tests were done, and am going in for more specific blood tests soon (lyme disease, etc). I am extremely fatigued, unable to really eat, and constantly nauseous. Nothing seems to be helping, I have tried Sea-Bands, Zofran, sparkling water and more. I feel as though this is not anxiety because it began with a fever and hasn't happened in the past, and also because it is continuing for so long. I have been sleeping plenty, need to go to school because it's senior fall and important for college. Any guesses as to what I should try or what this could be (besides anxiety) would be extremely helpful. I am getting desperate, as this sickness is lasting for what feels like forever and I don't feel that I can go on for much longer.",

It took 3 ultrasounds and finally an MRCP image to confirm it. My daughter has suffered her entire life with GI disturbances and we always blamed it on something else b/c we had never heard of agenesis since it is rare. Now we are left trying to figure out how to get her feeling better but we are also afraid that she may have additional GI deformities b/c she is always pressing on the gallbladder area saying that it hurts there. She also has severe joint pain, joint swelling, dizziness and fatigue. Anyone have any information or data on people actually born without a gallbladder or doctors that may be doing a study?

Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/23767/mysterious-illness,Mysterious illness,"Hi all,  I've had a mysterious illness for 4 years now but I won't bore you with all the little details. I've had every test under the sun done (literally), and have even been referred to Johns Hopkins University. I'm 100% healthy according to all tests.  Johns Hopkins thinks it's Migraine related.  It came about while eating dinner in 2013, I suddenly got very dizzy, foggy headed and confused.  The first year of this illness was the worst, tingling arms, confusion, dizzyness, extreme fatigue etc..  my eyes have been so puffy that I look 10 yrs older.  It has slowly gotten better over the years, or I'm just used to it now.  Slot of those symptoms have subsided but...  My main issue now (after 4 years) is that the tissue around my eyes are swollen 24/7 with pressure behind my eyes, and my neck cracks like crazy. It always cracks in the same place, in the center about 1"" above my shoulders.  They are related because when my eyes start to hurt worse, my neck starts to crack more, and I start to feel that foggy, spaced out feeling.   I have also found that I can make the situation better or worse. For example, if I eat a whole bunch of food I quickly start to feel spaced out, my eyes start to feel pressure and then a few minutes later my neck starts to get tense and I can crack it. On a bad day I can crack my neck at least 100 times. It Constantly feels like it needs to be cracked. It gets tight and grinds.  I can also make the situation much better by not eating much food or by fasting. If I do this my eyes only hurt a little bit and my neck will start to feel much better. I feel like eating any starchy carbs makes it happen very quickly.  I've been on so many different diets because I have thought that it might be food allergies but I've come to realize it's basically every food.  I've Also come to realize that it's probably not specific foods causing my problem but more along the lines of my body processing those foods, digesting food, or carbohydrates... I can't quite figure it out but it's definitely related to the amount of foods that I eat. Any ideas why food causes a stiff neck? Or painful eyes and pressure, for 4 years?!  Thanks!",
Heart Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/2863/mysterious-pulmo-or-cardio-problem,Mysterious Pulmo or cardio problem,"Hi everyone. I am a 30 year old Asian male. I'm about 165cm and I weigh about 49.8 kg. I have been a professional copywriter for the past 7 years and for more than a year now, I've been experiencing spells of breathing problems, palpitations and chest pains. There have also been several occasions wherein I felt as though my back would heat up whenever I lie down to sleep. Vices: I don't drink but I do smoke. And because of my work, I foolishly got into the habit of smoking a lot because it helped me concentrate. I would consider myself a heavy smoker for the past 7 years. I used to smoke about 25 sticks per day but now I'm down to 15. And towards the end of 2015, I was also drinking a lot of coffee. My health problems started on November 2015, a couple of months after I started working from home. I woke up feeling as though I'm not breathing right. I wouldn't necessarily say that I'm not getting enough air. I do have a pulse oximeter and my measurements are normally at somewhere between 95 to 99. But on that day, it almost felt like my lungs were struggling, like there was a thin layer covering the insides of my lungs (if that makes any sense.) No phlegm though. Towards the end of the day, I started palpitating so I went to the doctor and have my self checked. I underwent ECG and the only thing the doctor could find was a right bundle branch block. So, she insisted that I go for a pulmonary function test and a chest x-ray. Both of which showed nothing. Meanwhile, my condition continued to worsen due to sporadic chest pains. The pain would often affect random parts of my chest and upper back and they'd normally feel like they're coming from a bone or the spaces between bones (or at least that's what they felt like.) So, my doctor suggested that I go for a 2d echo exam. That too yielded no results so my doctor suggested that my issue might be psychological. I'd love to think that it is. I want to agree with her but after a couple of months of my condition failing to improve, I decided to see another doctor. This one deemed the same thing though he did perscribe me to start taking Coralan for my palpitations. He gave me the smallest dosage available and ordered me to take it twice a day so long as my heart rate isn't anywhere below 60 per minute. Eventually, he reduced it to only once a day. However, my condition remains vastly unchanged. I also took a blood exam but the only problem they found was that my uric acid was too high. I took meds for that already. These days, I really feel as though I'm out of breath. I'd feel out of breath whenever I walk my dog or whenever I climb up the stairs. There was also this one frightening occasion wherein I tried to jog and after a while, my sternum started hurting whenever I took deep breaths. But that only happened once. Could I simply be out of shape? I work from home now so I no longer have to walk 20 minutes a day for work. I try to walk every now and then but it hasn't been a regular habit. Could this simply be a side effect of my smoking? I smoke a lot less now but I still do because I find it extremely hard to concentrate while working. Or could this simply be--as my doctors said--all in my head? I'm writing this not expecting for a solid answer but I do hope you guys could point me toward the right direction. Thank you so much.",Heart Failure

So my doc gave me lactulose and said ""take as much as you need to go"" well I didnt know what enough was so I started taking up to 18 tbspns at a time every day. Then after almost a year of that, I started taking 1 cup of peglyte and 4 sennakot in morning and 4 at night. Every single day. I dont know wth I was thinking..IM so stupid!...anyway...so I eventually lost ability to go even with that. I only go one little amount..and then everything else is left over..even if i take a whole bottle of lactulose..ill only have initial release..then nothing else....   Ive had colonoscoy..and dr said everything is fine...ive since dropped laxatives significantly..I am now only taking 4 tbspns at night...but Im having these major issues: - Constant bloating - non-stop gas build up in lower stomache (almost like pressure building and popping, but no flatulence) - Passing of gas when I move in certain positions eg. (when i lay on my side for a few minutes, then turn over, i pass gas every time) - incomplete bowel movements ever single time. - acid reflux sometimes, gas pains - Crunching, popping feeling in gut   Now, after extensive research and everything seeming to fail..i think i might have figured it out... I MUST have completley stripped my intestinal flora.. i have no idea why the gastroenterologist didnt mention this to me. But I have a feeling that this is whats wrong with me. I hope anyway, because i have tried everything and nothing has worked...and i cant get a diagnoses...they alwasy say ""its the methadone""..bnut its not! Ive had opiate constipation..this is NOT it....Im not even constipated. I got almost every morning..,Its the constant symptoms ive listed....   Can anyone chime in on this and give me some advice? Maybe how i can restore flora..etc?   Much appreciate any help at all.. Thanks.",

She ran my thyroid levels since I only have half my thyroid. They came back abnormal and I was put on thyroid medication. I never felt better in my life. Primary doctor kept me on it for a few months and then wanted me off of it. A few months after being off of it I was eating a box of macaroni and cheese. It would be nothing for me to eat a whole box and want more to eat. I was fine one bite and then the next bite I felt this really full feeling or pressure right above my belly button. This pressure can get really bad with me eating one more bite, taking a sip of a drink, or doing nothing. It can be tolerable one second and then the next second I am miserable. I went to primary doctor who ran my thyroid levels again which came back normal. I was eventually referred to a gastroenterologist who has done two upper endoscopys, colonoscopy, gastric emptying study, SIBO breath test, Hida scan, and a manometry study(haven't gotten results of this). All have come back normal besides the SIBO test. I was put on an antibiotic for that which did not cure my symptoms. A year ago I was having severe stomach pains right where the pressure above belly button is and would move across abdomen. I went to the ER. They did a CT scan without the dye because I'm allergic to it. They were mainly looking at my appendix but I was told the scan was normal. My periods have also been very irregular. I went to my gyno about that. They did an ultrasound to look at my reproductive organs. They found a very small cyst on right ovary which should have dissolved on it's on. Funny because the tech told me she couldn't see my right ovary because a lot of gas and feces was blocking it. I belch a lot more. I get quick, sharp, stabbing pains in my abdomen where the pressure is and on the sides of my abdomen in that area, on my lower back (by kidneys), shoulder blades, and chest right below throat. I have a pressure on my chest just below my throat. I feel and look bloated sometimes. It feels like there is a balloon inflated inside right by my belly button that is pushing that area of abdomen out. I also have more frequent bowel movements. Can anyone help me get answers.

I didn't go again for a few days, and when I did, all I did was pass some bloody mucus. The next day, I started passing ACTUAL stool with the mucus (which after a while stopped having any blood in it, so that's a plus I guess). The stool was fine and normal, but causes horrible pain on my lower abdominal when its going down. I noticed this was the only time when I was in pain (although between BMs I'll feel awfully crampy and achy, but the next day I felt pretty good since I was ""empty"" and hadn't eaten a single thing, so nothing was moving through that ""problem area"") So here I am afraid to eat, so I haven't.

Here's the story: I recently went to the doctor to see about a pain above my right buttock. I got tested and confirmed a diagnosis of a UTI (which is unrelated, but I didn't know I had it), and Ankylosing Spondylitis. The UTI might be caused by my phimosis, but it doesn't happen often. Anyways, he gave me pills for the UTI that I had to take for a week. In this time period, I stopped masturbating for about 5 days because I didn't want to interfere with the healing process or whatever. When I did it again, I had this very uncomfortable feeling. You know when you ejeculate and you experience contractions in your penis that feel amazing? Well, it was like that, but I felt little to no pleasure at all. The contractions felt like I was constantly trying to push something out of the penis, like the semen was trying to rocket out too hard and the pressure was too great to enjoy it. It really killed the feeling for me and now I'm worried. It happened consistently for a while and now I just quit masturbating until I find out the issue. What's going on? Why did this suddenly start happening? Is it because I spend a lot of time sitting down? Do I need to consistently masturbate for a while until the pressure dies down? Was it there for a while and the UTI was just desensitizing it for me? It feels really weird and not like it used to. I really can't see the doctor about this because unfortunately my parents are very religious and don't condone masturbating of any sort.

The reason for me blocking my digestive system. I was given 60 hours to recover by myself then I would have to have an operation. 48 hours later I vomited 800 milliliters of bile.

Plus a bad touch sensitive area in my abdomen 4 inches above my belly button on the hiatus hernia scar at this point I have a dimple the size of the end of my middle finger.

Since I have been taken Naproxen my blood inflammation levels have gone back to normal. Naproxen seems to stop working after a while ( I start running night fevers etc ) and I switch to Meloxicam. Been to my Doctor recently and was told to start taking anti acid tablets which really upset my pain in the abdomen. Tried 3 types first two I could not abide Lansoprazole I stood for 3 weeks. No longer can I take them. I have had CT Scans with enhancements. Ultrasound examinations of everything and an endoscopy examination. All with no results. At it's best the pain is touch sensitive with the anti acid tablets my abdomen became very pain full. Galveston calms the pain as does Ginger root tablets and peppermint tablets. All taken together.  Before I started the anti acid tablets I could eat any food Very Hot curries etc. After the Anti acid tablets I am very much on a restricted diet. My GP is stumped as are three consultants I have seen. Recently I have found taking 2 7.5mg Tablets of Meloxicam tablets an hour before going to bed I go through the night without a fever.

We've been having sex since January, so for about 5 months on a weekly basis. And we haven't used condoms. (Yes I know its stupid. Really need to work on that one.) Since late February I notice after we hookup there's a change in my discharge. Usually more of it and its thicker than normal and I even get itchiness, only lasting maybe 4 days. Once I even had to get monistat because I was sure I had a yeast infection. But I thought maybe the changes were just due to the fact that after we hooked up we had to go on about our days which means hours without taking a shower. Then I ended up living with him for several days which we had sex several times a day during those days. And the same after reaction happened. But this last time we used a lube and I'm pretty sure I've ended up with an infection because of a reaction with the type of lube (infection having much more discharge, the odor, and I'm pretty sure the cottage cheese effect... :/). But still yet again with an infection. So I'm wondering if I could have some kind of STD that I need to get checked or what?!?

I had also noticed that I had been feeling sickly in general. I was experiencing a low grade fever, bad headache, bloated / distended belly , nauseated , feeling weak and tired. I was also having stomach cramps, lower abdominal cramping and some mild / moderate pain on the right hand side - a little lower than the rib cage.

A couple of days later -I became concerned and contacted my doctor's office - I was unable to get an appointment because she is out of the office and everyone else was booked. I did speak to a nurse and - She pointed out the that the items in the stool should be a concern since it sounded parasitic. (And considering I was recently on vacation in Florida - that wouldn't be unheard of). The nurse suggested that I visit an urgent care facility. On 07/31 -Once I was in Urgent Care I was sent to the ER because they don't deal with any abdominal pain issues. In the ER they drew blood and sent me for a CAT scan. I was advised that I would also be getting a rectal swab / exam. A few hours passed and a Nurse Practitioner advised that I had a burst cyst on my ovary.

I've had a history of stomach problems going back through recent years -  it can be extremely sensitive at times which mean I'm often needing to his the bathroom with the runs. Polyps near the end of my large intestine have also led to bleeding from my rear end, which is always fun... So I recently incurred an ingrown toenail on my left big toe which became infected shortly after. As a result of the infection, I went to my local doctor and was given a prescription of Erythromycin antibiotics, which lasted a week and ended on Saturday just gone. The toenail seemed fine after the course, not paining me, so I thought it would be ok to walk around on it as normal. The following Tuesday, pain had returned. a quick examination of the toe led me to believe that it had again become infected, as there was a yellowing of the skin in behind the nail. I again returned to my doctor who this time prescribed a stronger dose of antibiotics called flucloxacillin. I began taking them without thinking there'd be any side effect. The flucloxacillin began to throw my stomach for 6 - I was fine for the first day, but thereafter was experiencing diarrhea 3/4 times a day. I thought this a normal symptom, but it ended up getting so bad that halfway through the course I found myself with a pot of blood underneath me after a trip to the bathroom. I decided that taking the antibiotics were doing more damage to me than they were worth, so I stopped taking them at the halfway point and saw a podiatrist about my toe instead.  The podiatrist did the trick, but unfortunately the antibiotic has left my stomach in disorder. I stopped on Saturday and it is now Thursday and I've had persisting diarrhea (through not as frequent, maybe 2 times a day) and bloating/sensitive stomach since. Thankfully I haven't bled out since, but the stool has had a sloppy consistency and contains remnants of what I've been eating including peppers, nuts, corn etc. Today I had a case of orange stool, which a quick google told me isn't exactly a good thing.

To start with, I'm a 23-year-old male, standing around 5 feet and 3 inches tall, and I am slightly overweight - weighing about 12.9 stones (Or 180 pounds)  Around 2.5 years ago I had a severe case of Epididymitis in my left testicle which, by the time it was diagnosed had already caused damage to that testicle, and subsequently lead to testicular atrophy in the left side, and has left me with poor blood flow to the bottom half of my left testicle according to my Urologists who have done endless blood tests, blood flow scans, Ultrasounds etc...7  Shortly after this problem began to get better, I started getting pain in my right testicle, and despite the fact that every single scan and test has come back completely clear for the right side, my testicle on the right appears smaller and lighter than it used to be.  The 4 Urologists I've seen about this, including one whom carries the name of Professor have all said that the right testicle looks fine both inside and out, and it is around the wright size for my age, height and weight, however I know for a fact that this is not the case, as I remember it used to be bigger and a lot heavier than it is now.  Throughout my life I have been taking a medication called Atomoxetine for the treatment of ADHD. One of the side effects of this medication was that it would always cause my penis and scrotum to retract as if they were extremely cold all the time throughout the day - causing me to have to take hot or warm baths to temporarily solve this. It actually made it quite uncomfortable, and the surface temperature of the skin on my penis and testicles was quite cool as if not enough blood flow was getting to them. Stopping the meds has obviously solved this.  From time to time I get a tingling feeling in my scrotum, and my testicles quickly retract for a while, and only seem to go back to their ""loose"" formation when I'm very warm such as when in the Sauna or a hot bath. They then go back to normal.  My sex drive has not been affected as of yet and I can still have sex perfectly fine. I'm not so worried now about fertility since my fiance is now pregnant with our first child, but the size of things down there is really starting to bug me.  I have also gone to the extent of purchasing an Orchidometer, which doctors use to determine the size of testicles, and my right one does measure almost exactly the top size, which is 25ml and according to this, this is the normal size for an adult testicle, but things still feel a lot lighter and smaller than they used to be. My issue is that things used to be larger than they are, and there seems to be no evidence of any issue which could have caused the right side to get smaller, and yet I notice it quite a lot and notice that its not only smaller, but also a lot lighter than it used to be.  I've discussed the use of Clomiphene to my Urologists, which is a hormone used in women mainly, but can reverse testicular atrophy, but none of the 4 Urologists seem to think this is necessary.  So far I've had several ultrasounds by several different Urologists, physical examinations, blood flow scans and also had blood tests to see if I have the right amount of testosterone and growth hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, Luteinizing hormone etc... - all of which show normal results.  What on earth could this be? What can I do to reverse the atrophy (if anything) and what on earth could be causing it?  Thanks in advance!",Men's Issues

Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/8144/discomfort-under-my-rib-and-skin-problem,Discomfort under my rib and skin problem.,"Greetings! I'm 18 years old male with a long-lasting problem that I'm very hopeful you can give me some advice on. Here's how it went. About 2 years ago I've noticed cracked skin on my hand. Since then it's always cracking more with the exception of when I apply an ointment to it, after which it heals the skin for a bit. If it matters, ointment that I use is a local one with galipot as it's core component. About half year ago I did some tests on the matter: complete blood count, biochemical blood analysis, syphilis blood test, several different urine tests. Only values out of the norm on the result of these tests were AST and ALT activity level: 106 for AST, 196 for ALT. I then went for an ultrasound examination that have found me to have cholecystitis, with only other unusual notes being that bile echogenicity is slightly increased and there is a bend in the bottom part of the gallbladder, no stones or anything else unusual was detected. I also did test for HIV, Hepatitis A, B and C. All results were negative. Around 4 months ago, a noticable activity started taking place under my right part of the ribs: sometimes there's something moving or contracting, also a general feeling of tension around this area. There were no acute pains for that whole period. Since then the state of the skin on my hand was only getting worse in proportion to discomfort under my rib. Then around 3 months ago I started the following course of treatment in hopes of curing cholecystitis assuming it's the only problem: Allochol - 1 tablet after a meal 3 times a day; Silymarin(Silybum Marianum) 140mg - 1 capsule 3 times a day; Drotaverine - 200mg distributed for 3 times a day; Pancreatin - 2 tablets with a meal 3 times a day; I did that for a week and it was the first time the skin on my hand was getting healed on its own without the use of ointment. The feeling under the rib also got better, tension was gone and there were little to no contractions or any signs of movement. I then took a break for about a week and the symptoms began to return. After I noticed that, I returned to the same treatment plan, but this time it didn't seem to help that much after a week, discomfort considering skin and the tension around liver was slowing down but wasn't completely reversed this time. But I was adviced that it requires couple of months of this kind of treatment to take effect, so after a similar break of about a week I started taking these medications again, only this time plan was a little different: Allochol - 1 tablet after a meal 3 times a day; Silymarin(Silybum Marianum) 140mg - 1 capsule in the morning; Drotaverine - 120-240mg only when there are noticeable contractions at gallbladder area; Pancreatin - 1-2 tablets with tougher meals; After 1.5 weeks of this, the effect, again, was little and symptoms were only slowing down a bit. I did this for another 3 times, 1.5 weeks each, with around a week in between each. Each iteration it seemed like it was helping less and less, and definitely didn't seem like it was on the way of completely reversing the symptoms like it seemed initially. The general pattern is that under no medications my hand skin and area under the rib are in a very tough state, and with these medications its only about half as bad. Symptoms at current point in time consist of: general constant feel of tension, contractions or movement, sometimes burning - all that regarding area under my right part of the ribs, also rarely all of these symptoms can be felt in my chest for a small amount of time after which they return under the rib. I only had one noticeable bit of acute pain at gallbladder area in this whole period of time 2 weeks ago. The state of my hand skin correlates directly with discomfort under the rib. It cracks from time to time and when it does it also burns and itches. When I'm taking Drotaverine there are little contractions or any kind of movement, but it comes back if I don't take it. Other drugs on that list relieve general constant feel of tension and sometimes occuring burning under the rib. But they're still there, only little less while taking them. Overall, I don't seem to be heading on my way to recovery at all with current actions. So far it is only getting worse and I'm not even sure that cholecystitis is the only problem here. What would your professional advice be in this situation? Please help and I will be eternally grateful to you.",

By July 22nd (approx. 3-4 days later), I had a sore throat and it hurt to swallow, and when I looked, my left tonsil had started to swell and there were white patches on it. Other than that, I had no fever or any other symptoms of anything. I waited until Tuesday the 25th to go to the doctor because by that time, it had spread to the other tonsil. I didn't mention the encounter ( didn't feel comfortable about it), but she tested me for strep A, which turned up negative. She prescribed me amoxicillan to help with the infection, and I've been taking that three times a day since. The swelling and patches have gone down, but I'm still concerned over whether the amoxicillin will cure it completely if it wasn't standard strep or tonsillitis and is, indeed, a STD.  I know unprotected sex always carries these kinds of risks and the best way to know for sure is to get tested, but I'm curious: 1. What the likelihood of contracting this would have been for me given the circumstances, 2. Would the amoxicillin affect a throat culture result if I went and got tested, and 3.

They focus too much on whether something works or not but less on potency or just how effective it is or things like consistency and if the supplement is reliable or not. Yes, CLA works if that is what you are asking.  There are surely several studies which can be used to clinically/scientifically prove it. Furthermore, there is a meta-analysis in humans, from 2007, which identified 18 eligible studies and compared them and the conclusion was that conjugated linoleic acid taken at a dose of 3.2, which is a pretty small dose when it comes to CLA because it is of a weak potency, can be able to promote a modest body fat loss in humans. Modest is the key word here, however.  Another thing people mistake is when they presume that their results will be the same as the results seen in a certain study or trial. No, CLA may not even work for you. In fact, it is clear if you go and look at the studies and trials, that conjugated linoleic acid has had to contradict and mixed results. It is perhaps the most inconsistent and unreliable weight loss supplement. The claims that are made online about CLA, some are just to overhype it and to sell products, meaning they are not true. Conjugated linoleic acid at a 3 grams per day dosage can work depending on the person, you may need more, up to 6 grams per day if you want better results. Your results will also depend on how active you are regularly and of course on what you choose to eat and what caloric intake you have.  For those that are interested. CLA works through PPARs which are nuclear receptors in your body, essential for energy metabolism. It's just not that effective, CLA that is, and may work differently for each person.  Although it's found naturally in cattle beef or yogurt or milk and other products from ruminants, grass-fed cattle, the quantities in foods are not enough. You'll need to invest in a supplement and it just might not prove to be the best investment. I would advise you to consult a medic as well since CLA supplementation can come with side-effects. To those that are new to weight loss, it may sound confusing. What I mean is, there is really no supplement out there which can burn your fat away without you making a change first. Let me explain because it is very simple.  The reason why you are overweight is a combination of two main factors, unhealthy eating habits, and a sedentary lifestyle. No matter who you are, unless you have a health problem that is causing you to be overweight/obese, you are either not eating right or you are very inactive. Usually, it's both, a combination of both. Some are kind of active, they go out to run once per week, which is not enough when you have bad eating habits because you are not burning enough calories. This can be resumed in two words, imbalanced lifestyle. People that are fit lead a balanced lifestyle. Yes, they eat healthily but don't think that they don't eat pizza or fast-food or enjoy a cold beer, eat cake and sweets, etc. They do, but they don't do it regularly or abuse it.  So you may wonder, of what use is a supplement if I still have to exercise and diet? Well, if I am to be perfectly honest, you don't need a supplement to lose fat, it's that simple. They can help but you just don't need them to do it. There is no such thing as not being able to lose fat without using a supplement. Diet, exercise, and fat will go away, no doubt about it.  However, supplements can help, even though the benefits are quite small.  What's more, sometimes it's difficult to tell if the supplement is working since you are dieting and exercising and that boosts your metabolism and lowers your caloric intake creating a deficit and thus helping you to lose excess fat. There are hundreds, thousands of people that have lost fat without using a supplement, we know it's possible, it's a fact. It's common sense actually.  But let's go back to benefits of a supplement. Think of CLA (conjugated linoleic acid). It is quite popular, although there are misconceptions about it.  Could it help you? Yes, I mean it has clinical evidence. We know that it has influence over PPARs (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors). In turn, the PPARs have influence over your metabolism and its regulation as well as other things in your body.  Unfortunately it is one of the weaker weight loss supplements and it has mixed and even contradicting results in studies and trials but nonetheless, it can work. Some of you may use it, though, and not notice that it is working. It doesn't work for everyone and there are different isomers of CLA.  Especially if you are dieting and exercising, which you should be, you may just not be able to tell if it's helping. Using supplements like CLA Safflower Oil might improve your condition.

This has been going on for 20 plus years. Many doctors, tests, colonoscopies etc. with no diagnosis. I truly believe this is somewhat all in my head. EVERYMORNING I get up hours early and spend at least an hour on the toilet. At least three out of the 5 days to work I am making pit stops on the way to relieve myself. Funny thing is though while driving to work I get the urge that I have to go but when I sit nothing happens? Then once at work I am usually fine. And very rarely do I even go the remainder of the day. Weekends I do go in the morning but it is not to the extreme as it is on workdays. So is it mental? Is it my bowels? I really watch what I eat and when I eat, I have been going to the gym almost daily for months, my max weight at one time was 236 I am down to 205. I don't eat out, no fast food, but on occasions I may get a pizza o the weekend. Going back to a Gastreonologist today (again) to see what my options are at this point. No drugs I hope.",

I only had upper middle back pain which I still have to this day. However, I was put on 40 mg twice a day of Prilosec starting at the beginning of the year. I was on it for about two months. It made me feel absolutely horrible and it wasn't helping the initial issue so I went off of it and have been using Zantac to avoid the awful side effects of giving it up. So I have gotten myself down to 75 mg twice a day of Zantac and I am working myself off that. Basically, what I am asking is, I was COMPLETELY normal digestive wise before I went on Prilosec and now I have awful symptoms all the time like it's hard to breathe and swallow and my stomach just has so much acid and I know that these issues are because of my digestive system. What on earth can I do to get my body back to normal? I really have no clue why doctors are so fast to prescribe prilosec as it has basically ruined my life for the past half a year.

I am a 19 year old male who was relatively healthy until a few months ago. I had impacted wisdom teeth for about 3 months, and was taking NSAIDs pretty much every day for 2 of them.  At the time I was also smoking a lot, and developed a problem with mucous in my sinuses and throat. I was given 3 rounds of antibiotics which did not fix it, and then figured out that it was actually LPR, a type of acid reflux. I was also taking antacids pretty constantly for about 2 months before I was given a pantoprazole for 2 weeks followed by xantac. During this time I was often constipated, but nothing too major. Should also mention I quit smoking, was working out and eating healthy, and was all around relatively healthy Shortly after taking the ppi, my symptoms took a turn for the worse. I started to develop gas and bloating after eating, and shortly after experienced abdominal pain ranging from mild to severe for about 2 months. My stool was also very oily and filled with undigested food. Sometimes, I would also wake up and be extremely pale, weak and lightheaded for a few days, then return to the normal problem listed above.  I stopped taking any anti-reflux medication about 3 weeks ago, and although it has been a better, and the bloating, gas and pain is gone, there has been a huge swing in symptoms. For instance, I would get sweet smelling urine and be exhausted after eating carbs, but tested negative for diabetes twice, as this has gone away twice. I also experienced bodywide itching lasting for about 10 minutes, followed by brain fogginess and fatigue, which heavily worsed my ADHD, twice in two weeks. The first time eating whole wheat toast and eggs, and the second time being vector cereal. This hasn't happened while eating white bread. The last time that I was having the sweet smelling urine problems, I did a nocarb diet for a single day, before waking up the next day with such low blood sugar I couldnt stay awake, so I ate a bagel and since then have had no problems with sweet smelling urine or fatigue after carbs, besides when eating the vector cereal this morning. I also get lightheaded when standing up after laying down or sitting.  I have just recieved my ultrasound result, and they have found fluid interposed between diaphragm and dome of liver, along with in bare area of the liver. All organs including the liver show no signs of damage, and no ascites were found. The report says possible subcapsular fluid or perihepatitis followed by ""This is opposed to a right pleural effusion"". I have no idea what any of this means, so if anyone could help me out, or make suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it. I should also mention that bloodwork was mostly all fine, with slightly high ferritin and haemoglobin, and moderately high WBC leukocytes. I also take Dexedrine to treat ADHD, and tolerance has increased very rapidly, as I did not use it properly during the time of my severe problems, taking much more than prescribed just to function. I take anywhere from 60-100mg a day, and gives me no drug high effects at all. Thanks!","GERD and Heartburn , Constipation"

About 6 months ago I noticed pain during bowel movements and excessive blood in my stool that last 2 days then completely went away. I also noticed when squatting in the shower that my anus slightly buldged out so I took a picture and noticed it was dark purple. I assumed this was hemmoroids and it did not need to be checked out. Then about 2 months later I started experiencing stomach and lower abdomen pains that were not extreme pain but more discomfort. It would come and go and my stool consistency would change. Then everything went back to normal for a few weeks. This would continue to happen off and on over the next several months and everyonce in a while I would notice that my stool would occasionally be black. After that it would go back to normal. Now for the past month I have been feeling discomfort in my stomach and lower left abdomen. When I lay down I can feel a pulse in my lower left abdomen. If I press hard on it there is some slight pain but not severe. My stool consistency tends to change some times appearing slightly redish but not enough to be noticeably different. The other day my stool seemed normal except for one solid tiny white one. I have been very nervous about all of this but have moved far away fromwhere I grew up and do not have a doctor set up do could not be seen immediately by anyone. I also work on rotating schedules with limited to no time off which has also kept me from seeing a doctor. I have been googling my symptoms online but cannot seem to find much except hemmoroids, colorectal cancer, diverticulosis and other gastrational diseases. I am assuming that There is sometbing serious going on in me and it should be immediately looked at but also am afraid I waited too long at it could be too late to treat. Other traits I have is I smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol one-four nights a week depending on the schedule I am on. Can anyone shed light on to what I am experiencing?",

I'm 32 years old and have been experiencing a certain specific type of chest pain sporadically since around 13 years old. It is a sudden sharp pinch inside the left part of my chest, (about halfway between the center of my chest and my left nipple), and I am unable to breathe normally without severe pinching/stabbing pain for around 20-40 minutes. Each time I breathe I have to inhale at about 30% of a normal full breath, if I breathe any deeper than that it pinches or pulls or whatever is going on and its extremely painful. One time I tried to lay down but couldn't because I found the stabbing pain would happen when I leaned over or to the side. All I can do is stand as still as possible and wait it out while forcing myself to breathe shallowly. I have figured out for sure that an episode will occur when I ingest a certain amount of caffeine so I have been able to lessen the occurrences by reducing caffeine intake- but I never consumed a lot of caffeine to begin with and the last time it happened I had drank only a half cup of coffee over an hour earlier (which should have been fine). The pain is in the same spot each time- never changes. I have also gotten very mild versions where I think to myself ""uh oh, I'm going to get a heart thing..."" but it never fully develops. I also have very mild pain that almost feels like soreness very frequently in the same vicinity, though its not as localized and specific as the extreme pinching pain episodes. I'm at such a loss figuring this out. I could have sworn something would show up on the Echocardiogram.

I'm fairly new to the area and I don't have a Primary Care Physician so when I thought I needed the STD panel I went to a walk-in clinic. When the results came back positive I told my wife, who is (and was at the time of the affair) pregnant, to get tested and she told her boyfriend. She went to her OB/GYN to get the test and I know nothing about his but both of them came back negative. I have only had the one partner in the past 20 years so how I have syphilis and neither her nor her partner tested positive is bothering me.  My first question is do I actually have it? I received the results over the phone and was told to come in the next day for treatment. When the doctor came in the room she said my panel was all clear. I told her I was told I had syphilis the night before and she glanced at the chart and said ""oh yeah, you do"". She then had the admins come in to take my credit card so they could administer the two penicillin shots. The results paperwork they gave me shows Reactive for both the RPR and FTA-ABS tests with a 1:2 for my RPR Titer. Am I the victim of a Walk-in clinic scam? I've searched the internet for RPR Titers and found my score should fall after treatment. I also read that it fluctuates up or down a level, which is normal, but given my RPR titer is about as low as it can go, a single fluctuation would show my levels increasing and the treatment is not working. If I do have syphilis, how will I know the treatment is working? With my low RPR Titer, is it possible this is a sign of something else? I read about Lupis showing as a false positive but only in pregnant women. I also read about a couple skin diseases from South America and Africa.

About 2 weeks after exposure, I noticed a small, dime-sized discoloration on my upper inner groin (right side) on leg near crease. Wasn't raised, didn't itch, didn't crust, went 95% away within a week. I had prostate/penis pain about the same time, took 1000 mg of leftover azithromycin to try and kill anything I might have. I took a urine test at 3 weeks post exposure and had blood in urine, high blood pressure, but no infections were present. A week later (4 weeks post exposure) on retest blood was gone, was diagnosed as urethritis and told to flush with fluids. Has been fine for the last 7 weeks plus. The circular discoloration came back about a month later (9 weeks post exposure) and a nurse practioner and MD said it was tinea cruris and prescribed lamasil. The lamisil got rid of 95% of it and it can't really be seen unless you know where to look and look very closely. Still shows under a black light but was told that may be there for a while. Today, 11 weeks and 3 days after my only exposure, on my lower inner groin on the opposite leg (left) have a few small red bumps. They don't itch or hurt, but they are raised. There's some hair there. It appears under a black light I may have similar bumps on my other leg in the same spot, but that area doesn't seem as red or bumpy. Is there any way I could be having an initial herpes outbreak 11+ weeks after exposure? I feel fine for the most part, and have never had any type of herpes outbreak, cold sore, or anything.  Also, I took an HIV test 6.5 weeks after exposure and was negative. I've had very, very mild throat tenderness (I hesitate to call it sore) the last 5 weeks. Is there any way I have HIV and should I test again? Manic here, please help. My exposure was a single one, and a mistake. I pray it hasn't been compounded.","Men's Issues , Genital Herpes"

The good news: Chlamydia is easily cured by antibiotics. The bad news: 50% of women who contract the disease don’t know they are infected and 30% develop serious complications.

Blood tests, 1 fecal test, and MRI came up blank. Then a combination colonoscopy/endoscopy images only showed what the Gastro doc said was a 'green bean'. A single, unscathed, tiny, green, round, tapered, something that looked like it was somehow magically wedged in the fluctuations of the intestinal wall, in spite of virtually everything else being removed from the entire digestive tract by the preparatory flush the day/night before. Unchewed.....undigested....and not a cut green bean.....and my wife told the doc that can't be because she hasn't had green beans in weeks. The staff dismissively said ""you'd be surprised how often it happens'.  The reason I am posing this scenario to a community like this, and hopefully a handful of people in the medical community legit, is because after seeing the images, becoming enraged, researching the web for hours in pursuit of shooting holes in my assumptions (which are without having an actual medical background) I am poised to hammer this doctor for his amazing ineptitude, unless I see some compelling reason to give him benefit of doubt.

About a week ago, I showered with a new type of soap and straight after I experienced a sharp pain-like feeling in my vagina, and as soon as I left the shower to urinate, it stinged and burned real bad. It went away though, and I was completely fine for the next two days. I then think I developed a bladder infection because it hurt whenever I urinated. A day after that I started experiencing a really painful feeling down there and when I took a look, I saw that there were tears around my vulva and it looked like some sort of sores. It has spread some more until now, and hasn't gotten any better. I was on a few antibiotics at once and also used a cortisone cream for the tears/sores down there. I have a white-ish yellow discharge that looks kind of like jelly. I saw a doctor today and he said it could possibly be genital herpes. The sores/tears are still very painful and I can barely sit down without being in pain. When I look down there, using my phone's flash the tears are quite yellow in colour. My vagina is also very swollen. Could it be a bacterial overgrowth or yeast infection? Or could it possible be herpes? My boyfriend of 2 years promised me that it's not possible for him to have herpes, so I'm very unsure of what to do next.

Besides having pain, I also burp right after eating or drinking...I rarely burped before. Burning is worst in the a.m. (after digesting) and at night.  Is there ANYONE who might relate to this or know what this is? I'm so confused and upset. I eat healthy and don't drink/eat acid trigger foods. I just ordered DGL tablets...I'm willing to try any supplement/diet. Thank you.","Ulcers , Bloating"

The Gp this time thought that it might be a situational muscle pain and there was nothing we can do about it? I dont understand this diagnosis my sons routine is fairly consistent so how can a muscle all of a sudden start to cause problems with no overt exercise or trigger? I need to find some idea of what it could be so that I can help him either to get the right medical attention or find a way of helping him manage this better. The only other piece of information I have is that the pain eases after a nights sleep and gets gradually worse again throughout the day my son generally tends to reduce his food intake during this time can only manage about 1 meal a day. I really hope that someone out there can help to give us a bit more direction/ideas to take back to the Dr's as I am currently losing faith in the medical world thank you in advance",

One year ago I had a cholecystectomy and ever since then I've been having some severe digestive issues. After eating I will have severe cramps, foul smelling gas and diarrhea (both smell like sewage and could knock out a horse), and I can see undigested food, mucus, and is usually rather ""explosive"". There are some foods that I consider ""safe"" or that my stomach has adjusted to, but if I'm eating something I haven't had or eaten in a while then I pretty much know I'm going to start with the severe cramping, gas & diarrhea about 20mins after eating.  I'm not sure if this is related, but about 8 months ago I mentioned this to my PCP and she did a stool test and I tested positive for EAEC (enteroaggregative e. coli). I'm not sure if it's still present but it's now exactly a year that I've been having these stomach/digestive issues.  I haven't been and don't want to go back to the doctor for something that might just be simple digestive issues. Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas as to what this might be? Perhaps just IBS?

I have had two stomach fundoplications to correct an issue with the top sphincter of my stomach as I was constantly regurgitating my food. About 6 months after the second surgery the symptoms all came back. I have been referred from doctor to doctor and am now seeing one of the top GI surgeons that there is. With extensive tests, they show that I suffer from significant gastric emptying delays (5 hours after eating my stomach isn't even 1/4 empty). With two surgeries already done and failed, the only option is to perform a Roux En Y. I am ok with having surgery, that's not the issue. The more I think about what life will be like after, the more nervous I get. I am looking for advice on coping with the adjustment to life after surgery.

About 4 days ago I've noticed a small pain in the right of my pelvis while I was masturbating , the pain was dull but the day after I masturbated twice at an interval of about 4 hours. The second time there little semen and transparent watery liquid which has happened before but with no pain. I've google some stuff and I think that this pain is because I masturbated to frequently and should cut/pause masturbation for around 6 weeks. It doesn't hurt that much and the pain usually occurs when I get and erection and / or I start masturbating , but it goes away half the way to finishing , I've never ejaculated after I felt the pain. I've started masturbating today but didn't finish after thinking of the consequinces , after 10 minutes my right side of the pelvis became a little numb and it hurt a bit, but the pain stopped right after.

I am 27 years old and have been suffering with GERD symptoms for a long time. I started out when I was near my 20's and I was nauseous all the time. My doctor then told me to take Tums. I hadn't experienced heartburn yet. Years down the road I noticed i'd have heartburn after eating certain meals like Mexican food and certain alcoholic beverages. Fast forward to the past couple of years where it has gotten super bad. I remember waking up out of a dead sleep super nauseous and I had to call out of work as I had gotten no sleep and wanted to vomit everywhere. I never took PPI's until a couple of years ago. I didn't know you had to take them for a 2 week period for them to work. I tweaked my diet and eliminated my trigger foods. I'll admit I have some chocolate here and there but all other triggers are gone. I've changed my lifestyle as well by eating lots of snacks throughout the day instead of big meals. I find if I drink a glass of water and eat soup or a decent meal I will end up regurgitating it when I go to ""burp"". I have grown sick of it as I feel like a fire breathing dragon the majority of the time. This affects me to not want to do anything including working out as I can't cope with the pain. It makes it so hard to function in dance rehearsal sometimes. I am getting an endoscopy on Friday and hoping it provides me with answers. I am getting used to avoiding my trigger foods but it seems like there are tiny micro triggers that make all the difference still unknowingly in my diet. I know everyone has different triggers and safe foods. I just want to avoid being on long-term medication if it has negative effects. I can only picture myself snapping my ankle in dance class while landing a leap in the long-run which would be catastrophic to me. It sucks because I can't go to certain restaurants with friends due to my predicament. I always feel like a bother when I have get togethers because I can't eat much of anything they want to eat. This is especially true of get togethers where the easiest food option is pizza. That's a total no-go for me. I told my boyfriend and best friend that I would cook something with my triggers in it for them and modify a version for myself so I wouldn't have to burden them. I feel so annoying always talking about my reflux but I really just want to beat it and be happy. I was hoping they would find H. Pylori when they tested so I could be treated and go back to normal life. That was a negative. I am being realistic when it comes to my endoscopy. They are probably going to diagnose me with GERD and I am hoping any biopsies they take give good insight and not any bad news. I will do anything to make this condition better. I am hoping for a strict diet to be given to me to see if I can negate the micro trigger foods I seem to be missing. I am not the classic person who takes medicine so I can eat those triggers. Occasionally I would love to have some chips and salsa or a slice of pizza, but if I can't then I am okay with that. Currently I take 20 mg of Omeprazole before breakfast and before dinner. Looking forward to results and hoping for a reflux free future. My sanity and my teeth are banking on it haha. I attribute some new cavities to the acid that comes up. I'd love to hear everyone else's story as well and how their endoscopy experiences were.",GERD and Heartburn

I figured I had a UTI so went down to CVS and got a testing kit and tested positive for leukocytes.

My boyfriend said he would go in to get tested but unfortunately was not able to make it because of spring break. However, I recently had to go in for a ridiculously high fever, which turned out to be the flu, but while I was there the doctor who saw me that time discussed my case with the doctor I saw for the UTI and she then told me that she doesn't believe I have the flu, she thinks I have HIV. She wanted to draw blood but I said no I'll go to a free clinic that's in the area. The doctor was about to exit the room when she told me that they were going to give me the shot for gonorrhea right then. I told her that all the symptoms of my UTI were gone so I think the test just went wrong and I never had gonorrhea to begin with. She then said, ""You never had a UTI, your urine sample was cultured and cured (or something like that)"".

Symptoms: - Dull sensation in lower right quadrant of abdominal - not sharp and does not get worse when pressed on. - Similar pain in upper right quadrant of abdominal - Seems to get semi-sharp for a few minutes and then fades without reason. Just under the rib cage and does not get worse when pressed on.  - Random and sporadic dull sensations throughout rest of abdominal. - Occasional diarrhea but not bad at all - 99% of stool is solid and normal. - No blood or discoloration in stool - No vomiting - No fevers (check daily) I've seen two doctors and done blood tests to check for inflammation about 3 weeks ago but they came back normal. Doctors said there's nothing they can do if it's not sever, so take pain killers and ibuprofen (which i have not been doing). Right now the one that bugs me the most is the upper right ab pain. It's all in the front/side. Nothing in the back area. I've been assuming IBS but I have no idea. It's been 4 weeks and it seems to come and go but I feel it at least once day. It's mainly the right side pains that continue.  Food doesn't seem to impact it.  I'm taking Vitamin B, C & D, Pro and pre biotics, and garlic oil. Eating lots of fruits and drinking lots of water.  I have some very strong anxiety related to medical issues and I had severe anxiety leading up to the start of this. I also had some acid reflux leading up to this but haven't had any since this started.

I've been having these ""attacks"" since April 2012, I'll give as much detail as I can in the hope that somebody can help me diagnose the problem. The attacks themselves can happen at any time of the day, I've had them in the morning and evening and last for approximately 2 - 3 minutes. They start with a build up of pressure in my chest so I know a minute or two before it starts that its on its way. My arms get very heavy and then I sweat profusely, so much that my clothes are drenched from head to foot including outer layers. The pain in my chest is like a burning sensation that gets worse and worse and feels very tight too. Once the attacks are happening I tend to get very agitated and quite anxious, though I'm not at all anxious before they begin and so I'm quite certain they are not Anxiety attacks. I feel slightly dizzy, a little confused and extremely uncomfortable within myself. I often, but not always start to hyperventilate, but other times I lie there hardly able to move and breathing very shallowly. A lot of the attacks have started after strenuous manual work but plenty of others have been first thing on a morning when I have only been out of bed for half an hour, I even had one just after getting out of the bath! After the attacks have calmed down I tend to feel extremely cold, very weak, quite emotional, and often I have tingling in my arms, hands and face. The attacks can occur quite randomly, once a week, once a fortnight or twice in a week. So far I've had roughly 18 or 19 of them. I was admitted to hospital after the first attack and initially they said it was a heart attack but after plenty of tests including an MRI and an Angioplasty they decided it was a ""false positive"" and my heart is ok. I attended my local GP a couple of times but she refuses to listen to me and insists i am suffering from Acid Reflux. These attacks are nothing like that, having suffered from Acid Reflux quite a few years ago I speak from experience. I hope somebody out there can enlighten me as to what I may be suffering from so that I may move on with my life. Many thanks.",

It usually starts the same way: I wake up hungry, and the hunger gets worse after I eat, even if I eat a lot. It is extremely unpleasant and makes it difficult to function. The only 2 things that seem to relieve the hunger are: (1) drinking a lot of water and exercising vigorously afterwards, and (2) eating and then going to sleep. For several years, this would happen at least once a week. Then the problem went away for 7 weeks, only to return for no apparent reason this week, and recur every other day.

I should add that I was born in Indonesia but left the country for the US when I was 3 years old and I have came back to visit on 3 other separate occasions - when I was 5 years old for 3 weeks, 9 years old for 3 weeks (this was shortly after I moved to Canada), 17 years old for 7 weeks. I am now 26 years old.  For the first three days my bowel movement seemed normal but then after eating some salad with lettuce, cucumbers, carrots, red peppers and some broccoli - more than just an amount for a side on the second and third day (since I would eat this from time to time in Canada) I started to feel stomach pain and suddenly I had uncontrollable, sudden urge nasty diarrhea the on the fourth day and have been getting milder diarrhea since then including the time of this writing. I've never experienced diarrhea or any bowel disorder during my previous visits and I believe it has to do with the vegetables I have eaten, as I have never had a salad in Indonesia (in the past I've only eaten cooked vegetables if any at all here). I did wash them intensively before slicing them up but I have read that I should've stayed away from uncooked vegetables altogether due to poor sanitation and whatnot here. For the past four days I have stayed away from spicy food, fried food, dairy products, fruits, and fruit juice. Since it seems likely I have traveller's diarrhea from some bacteria (ecoli?) I would like to know if there's something more serious going on like Crohn's disease. The only symptoms I have are on and off stomach pain and diarrhea that's not as bad as the first day and more controllable but still more liquid than it should (no fever, no vomiting, no loss of appetite, although not sure about weight loss). Also when I do take a dump it comes out smoothly with little forcd and my anus does not feel pain afterward. I do plan on going to the hospital near me (I'm in urban Bandung) and seeing a doctor maybe looking into a colonoscopy but I want to get as much insight and opinions as possible.

No pains, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, etc. Tylenol makes it subside so I can sleep.  Other symptoms I've noticed are increased burping (e.g. After having had dinner 7 hours earlier), an increased need to swallow (like the lump in your throats feel) and a possible sensitivity to some foods? (explained further below) I went to ER on 4/26 and all they could say at that point was that my lipase level was 68 and WBC was 13. My EKG was good and chest X-ray was clear. Negative for Lyme and bacteria cultures were clear.  I have to note that, being stuck in the ER for 8 hours that day, I didn't get to eat anything all day and only had a non-fat yogurt, low-fat breakfast bar, carrots and water for dinner when I got home. I made it through the night with no issues.  4/27 was mostly good as well - stuck to low-fat foods and was ok all day. For dinner we had homemade fajitas but I'm wondering if the spices or wrap triggered this again because I had the same issue.  4/28 felt chilled when I woke up, lasted until around noon when it changed like a light switch and I became flushed; red and warm in the cheeks, neck and ears. That lasted for about two hours and then I was fine for the night. Again, food intake was light and on the low-to-no fat side.  Got up this morning and stayed on that food path - cheerios, almond milk, banana and breakfast bar. Still feel fine right now. Just overall a little weak and/or sluggish, which is no shock since I'm not eating like normal.  Overall, I get hunger sensations but have to almost convince myself to eat. My normal eating desire just doesn't seem to be there. I'll admit though that I'm also a little nervous as to what to eat, because I don't want to trigger the chills again (if food is even a trigger), but I'd say the lack of desire is a bigger reason as to why. Not surprisingly, I've lost a few pounds over this week because my caloric intake is definitely way down compared to normal.  Last week, I had started adding at least 1 tsp cayenne pepper and ~.6 tsp turmeric to my daily smoothie to try and help with my BP. That's the only dietary change I can think of prior to this whole thing starting. I stopped adding these on 4/22 (date of the first night I started with this issue), mainly because it tasted horrible, so not sure if that's what started this. Possible inflammation of some part of the digestive system?? Or did it just bring some other buried issue to light now? Should they be sending me for a CT scan or something else? They don't seem that concerned by it, but I can't keep on like this and lose more weight. It's only been a week and I've had two people comment that I'm looking thinner.",

I am 25 and have been having this problem since Feb 2016. I was in a serious relationship that ended in September of 2014, which really destroyed me and tried some dating for the next year which never worked out and I haven't really been dating in over a year. I have never had difficulty with erections, in fact quite the opposite. My whole life I would just get them all the time and my biggest problem was trying to hide them. When I stopped dating, I was masturbating a lot more, like a couple times a day and then all of a sudden things weren't working the way they should. I can still get an erection but it is very difficult and usually not as hard as it used to be, usually requires a fair amount of physical stimulation or pornography to really get things going and sometimes not even then. I went to see my GP last summer, who basically said I wasn't eating enough salad and referred me to a urologist. I saw the urologist who basically decided in 5 seconds it was all in my head and pretty much just walked out. Since then, there was a 5 day period where things got much better (I'm not sure why) where I felt like things were almost back to normal again except they got gradually worse until I was back to where I was at the end of the 5 days. I do have a busy lifestyle but I don't think I'm all that stressed. I have also had issues with frequent urination and not completely emptying during urination. In general my penis feels a lot smaller and more compact and even colder than it used to. Could this all somehow be in my head? I had a blood test which showed very slightly low blood pressure and very slightly elevated cholesterol but the urologist said that was nothing. I did not have an STD panel but it has been a long time since I've had intercourse and it's at the point where I'm afraid to get intimate again because I feel like I probably will have difficulty preforming. Testosterone level was above average. I very rarely wake up with morning wood anymore and don't get all the erections during the day that I used to anymore. This is causing a lot of depression and self esteem issues for me which is probably feeding back into the problem. Does anyone have an idea what is wrong? I could use some good advice.",

Me and my GF are in highschool I am fifteen she is sixteen, last time she was checked for STDs was February 2016 a month before we started dating (which means we would be dating for a year next month so woohoo) and everything csme back negative including HSV-1. I have gotten cold sores dating all the way back since elementary school but last year after spring break I got hit HARD with cold sores like one every two or three weeks but It has died down very heavily since then. three days ago before I noticed we were making out and she touched the spot that the cold sore was forming and because... ahem... moist she ended up putting her hands on her genitalia to hide it, now normally I wouldn't be too worried but as a very rare and unlucky occurance she not only wore a skirt and lace panties that were too small (pretty sure only in th back though) and she pushed it down and her hands again were right against her genitalia. Now if this matters again going back to my bad time last year with cold sores she had no qualms about kissing me when i had a obvious cold sore and even once or twice while it was oozing (becuase lets be honest no matter how okay you are with it that is disgusting) so she likely already got it from me before June or whenever summer break starts but as far as I know she has never had out breaks and has never touched my cold sore then immediatly touched her genitals/ directly touched herself (she always wears jeans and from what I read it wouldn't pass through those) although now that I think about it she might've but if I get an answer for the first question i'll likely get this one answered as well but if you want to answer this one directly as well please do. So back to my more recent question, if she touched a cold sore that wasn't even formed yet and touched her vag? And if it matters I only noticed the tingling/ on and off warm feeling after wards and I put abreva on twice when I got home that day and the warm feverish feeling was on and off like I said and same with the tingling (i think) and its been doing that for three days now and I put abreva on once yesterday. Another question of a similar stature but this happened this morning, The spot was still deciding whether or not it was going to be a cold sore or not but I did notice some bump on my lip in the area but it has been there for months and the general area was more smooth probably which is why i noticed it (just in case its a bump that looks like blood has clogged it, its probably a scar) and white marks under the skin one meh sized one above the bump and one a little bit more the right. I don't know if they were there is the morning but if they have they really haven't changed at all. But the problem her is I accidently said something that made her wet... like garden hose leaking wet apparently and she touched the spot again and did touch her crouch but I am pretty sure her jeans would have prevented it to pass and if she was basically masturbating (yeah I know... in a public place to...) but a little time passed and she went to class and immediatly asked to use the restroom which was two halls away I should add. But i fear her hand may have had some of her ""stuff"" on it and since its warm an moist would have kept the virus alive on both her hand and possibly her pants and that when she cleaned her self up she could have infected herself and while I am here typing I fear it could have happened when she cleaned herself up on the skirt day. So here is my question in a nutshell: could any of the ways of cold sore (erupted or not) to hand to genitals/ cold sore to moist hand/pants to genitals infect her? If she was already infected by me without any symptoms (I mean she does have two or three white bumps on her lip but theyve been there for months now and have not oozed fluid so if you can tell me what it is please do) would she have devolped anti bodies to HSV-1 by now? or would she have to wait until her first outbreak? Now I am sorry for all the questions and that that is so long and all over the place but I wanted to be descriptive. I belive the person who moniters these questions is Grace and I would like an answer from her since she seems to be very knowledgeable but I am open for anyone who can give answers and reasons for that answer.

I just Fing want someone to take me seriously. I have even emailed a couple of researchers who have written articles on the female orgasm, specifically in regards to the multi-orgasm phenomenon. I'm the boyfriend of a 36 year old woman who although can experience a single orgasm through clitoral self-stimulation, she experiences over 100 orgasms during vaginal intercourse alone within a 15 minute period. Which she calls a ""rolling orgasm"".  This rolling orgasm is described by her being a multi-orgasm where she has an orgasm quickly followed by more orgasms that start seconds apart, but quickly become more frequent, in shorter intervals, in a quick sequence over and over again. She claims to have as many as 150 within a 15 min period of vaginal intercourse. Now, although I am not a doctor by any means. I have however read articles regarding Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder. What separates what she experiences during vaginal intercourse from PGAD is the fact that she is motivated by her own sexual expression and pleasure which does not stem from a genital ""itch"" or ""throb"", but rather from her desire that is voluntary and under her control. Although, she does admit that she constantly preoccupies her thoughts and imagination with the thought of vaginal intercourse and has a hard time thinking about anything else due to a self-described ""addiction"" to this multi-orgasm phenomenon brought on by vaginal coitus. Look, I have researched all over the place trying to look for answers for what she is experiencing besides the idea of just going to therapy for sex addiction. Even the definition of a female sex addict doesn't seem to describe her due to the research I've read stating that sex addiction isn't really a need for the pleasure of the orgasms. I just want to know what the F is going on. Not that I'm too worried about her, but she does seem to have a little difficulty staying on task at work and needs a release, refusing self clitoral stimulation because ""it's not the same thing, not as strong, and not the same feeling."" Personally, I think she should be studied and could possibly help a lot of people, but I don't think anyone believes me. It's driving me crazy trying to get answers.",Women's Issues

Right now I am fighting a respiratory infection along with the burping issue. This has happened in the past and I'm really, really, tired of it. I am on multiple medications, but I'm not sure that is the issue. Any help anyone can give me would be really appreciated as I am losing weight and getting tired of feeling like crap all the time. Thanks so much!",
Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/6790/stomach-pains,stomach pains,"I'm around 16 years old, and I have sort of a long history. It may or may not all be connected, but here it is:   Ever since my period started, it was unstable, so my mom thought I should try Chinese medicine. About a year after consuming it almost daily, I got what the doctors told me was just a stomach flu. But it didn't feel like all the other stomach flues I've had. After the first week, where I normally would I have been better, I still had no appetite. The doctors I've visited said I should try opening it up with something other than bread, noodles, and congee, so I tried some noodles with a bit of oil and broccoli. I ended up with wicked abdominal pain, and the ""no appetite"" sensation went on for about two months.  It's been a year since my initial ""stomach flu"" started, and so far, and I've gotten sick again every couple months. Although each time, the details varied, some of the symptoms would be the same (I had a coated/furry tongue one of the times): I would have abdominal pain that would be relieved after diarrhea (and unless I wanted to go through it again, I'd be limited to very simple foods), it would take more than a week (sometimes months) for me to get back to normal, gas/belching, bad taste in my mouth, and loss of appetite. I've done stool testing and blood testing, but everything came back normal. All the doctors I've visited don't think its anything more than a viral infection, and I've stopped going after the first 3 times.  Now I've gotten sick again. This time, along with the gassy sensation, my stomach would ""burble,"" and occasionally, when I breathe in and out, the upper left side of my stomach would make gurgling noises, and I feel like it's sucking air in and out. As well, I had abdominal pains/discomfort after eating just plain white bread. I'm also currently on my period, which despite the Chinese medicine, did not make it entirely better. I'm not sure if one of the problems is affecting the other, but at the same time, my period has been just trickling for almost a week, and even for me, that's a bit strange. On the few occasions where my period would come normally, it would last about a week or more, and the first few days are often painful in the vagina. (I also don't know if that is normal) Yes, I realize IBS is a possibility, and so have the doctors I've visited, but it doesn't seem like there is anything in my life that would likely ""trigger"" it.",

Male, 57 yrs old, no history of major illnesses. Moderately overweight and enjoy my wine at dinner time. History and symptoms: * change in bowel habits over 6 month period; more urgency/frequency, change in form, generally softer and thinner * some discomfort in lower left quadrant, sometimes spasms * Generally OK during the night * cannot associate with foods and diet *symptoms were more variable recently (had some good uneventful days) but now seems more consistent * no visible blood, no appetite issues, no fever, no weight loss * lots of gurgling in belly * Last Colonoscopy 4 yrs ago, all negative, no polyps or other diseases * Saw GP about 1 month ago, thought it was muscular in nature, ordered abdominal ultrasound. All good except for some fatty liver.  * Blood tests one month ago, all good, liver profile, glucose etc * I have a follow up apt on May 1 with GP again to see what are the next steps, more specifically to rule out a major disease. I guess my post is about hearing your thoughts as to whether this could be IBS. I have been told I had this in the past based on bowel changes, was prescribed probiotics which seemed to settle things after several weeks of use. I stopped them and restarted when these similar symptoms started but they don't seem to be working. I am concerned something major is going on like cancer, but hopeful that a clear colonoscopy 4 yrs ago buys some security there. Would love to hear your thoughts thanks",

I have been diagnosed on two occasions with Pancreatitis based on blood tests and an MRI. An upper endoscopy revealed a hiatal hernia and esophagitis. The symptoms I am having seem to me to indicate some other cause or multiple conditions occurring at the same time. Reflux wakes my up at least a couple times a week. I have pain on my right side below my ribs as well as to the left of that area below my sternum. Sometimes the pain near the pancreas feels like I am full from a large meal but only around the pancreas, this makes it difficult to get a deep breath at times. Pain under my ribs from left to right all the way across. Nausea once or twice a week. Bloating and pressure in my stomach. Which is sometimes visible. I also have a lot of noise in the digestive area, sometimes loud enough for others to hear. Sometimes it is the same noise from the same area multiple times in a row. I am male 48 and eat a very healthy diet, no eating out, fast food, or boxed meals. I have no diarrhea or constipation and have a bowel movement about 3 times a week. These symptoms began about 20 months ago and seem to be getting more frequent and worse. Do all of these symptoms point to one possible condition or multiple conditions at the same time? My life is continually interrupted and keeping a normal schedule is next to impossible. I would appreciate any thoughts on this so that I may do research on it as I am feeling lost.

So, by the time I do eat, I'm ravenous and I eat too fast. Even when I'm not ravenous, I eat too fast because I have things to do, and need to get on with it. So, I thought this was an issue of not chewing, so the food was stuck and would work it's way down.

For a number of years now I have experienced an urgent need to empty my vowels. This will happen at a random point in the day, and when it happens I have to rush to the toilet. In the past this has always been put down to 'IBS', but my understanding of IBS is that it is something that flares up and that there are times where you are unaffected, but this has been an ongoing problem for me everyday (sometimes every other day) for years. Once I have been to the toilet and has the bowel movement I then feel fine again and can carry on as normal until the next time (the next day usually).

It's not quite related to digestion, but it was the closest category I could find. I have an unusual case that I have been battling for many years now. I would greatly appreciate for someone to take the time to read what I have to say to give me some advice, as I am at a complete loss and I am going to face the same dreadful problem very soon if I do not find help. Thank you so much! Every year my family goes on vacation overseas and I have to take a plane. The problem is, I get extremely sick on the plane, NOT FROM MOTION SICKNESS. As I go deeper into the airport, I already feel uncomfortable. When going towards the plane on the aerobridge, I begin to feel much queasier from the ""airplane smell"" I start to feel very light-headed and nauseated as I approach the airplane. On bad years, I throw up even before stepping on the plane due to the smell. I try to breathe through my jacket to make the smell less intense. Once I am about to board the plane from the bridge extending from the airport, a wave of ""airplane smell"" hits me and I try to hold in my vomit. This is always futile, as I always throw up at least once before even taking off. This reaffirms the notion that it is not motion sickness. Throughout the flight, I experience flu-like symptoms: I vomit at least a dozen times, cannot get up from my seat, have a massive headache, and feel overall nauseated. Eating or drinking anything in the smallest quantities results in me throwing it up within seconds or minutes. I cannot eat or drink for a full 10 hours on my flight. When the meals are brought out, I feel even worse. Also, the smell of the blankets and the pillows provided makes me throw up as well. My theory on that is the compressed vacuum sealed air for both the food and the blankets. As I do not have motion sickness, my best guess to me ""disease"" to the smell of the plane is the compressed air that is in the cabin as I would not be able to breathe otherwise. All doctors I see locally have not seen a case remotely similar to mine and cannot think of anything to give to me to ease the pain, only generic Advil or something like that. We have tried all conventional methods used to ease sickness on the plane including every homeopathic medicine under the sun. As doctors cannot prescribe me anything, I have not tried any potent medicine. I would greatly appreciate anyone's help to aid me through my next flight. Thank you so much for reading this through!",

I am a 23 year old male who just recently lost his virginity and is currently in a relationship. However I had received oral sex about 1 year ago.  I noticed a few days ago some bumps on my foreskin. They are small and reddish white and there are about 6 of them. Not really clustered up in any way though. There is no irritation except for a minor itch that comes and goes. However when looking up information about it I have come to realize that my foreskin is supposed to retract behind the head of my penis. I had never known that or done it. During sex it never retracted though i felt some pain when it was pulled back. I thought that was abnormal and so i stopped it.  I was a bit worried about possible STD from the 1 year ago encounter but this has only popped up after losing my virginity and I have had an STD test about a month ago and everything was clear. I believe she is clear as she has only had one partner before me. Last night I pulled back my foreskin (painfully) for the first time in my life and didn't notice any abnormalities on the head of my penis. It then got stuck but I was eventually able to pull it back over.  Id like to add that growing up i did have pimples sometimes on my penis and some irritation from time to time. Having been a virgin and never knowing about retracting my penis I assumed it was normal. But it was never 6 different ones at once. Usally 1 maybe 2. So with all of that said I was wondering: 1. If anyone had any idea what the small bumps are. I am worried they might be HPV genital warts but I think it could also be balanitis. I do not think they are herpes. 2. Could I have gotten genital warts from receiving Oral Sex. I highly doubt it would have come from my partner but nothing popped up until this week? 3. What do I do about retracting my foreskin. I did it once yesterday but I am very fearful of doing it again.  I do plan on seeing a Doctor very soon but until then some answers would put my mind at ease.,Men's Issues

At first we assumed it was just a bug but realized after about a week that something else was wrong. In consulting with her midwife, she took some probiotics and limited her dairy intake (she never struggled with dairy before). That seemed to help some and kept things under control to a certain degree but didn't eliminate it. We assumed it was related to the pregnancy and once the baby came all would be well.

I have had constipation problems for at least a year. They started as mild, improved and are now worse. I have had upper right quadrant discomfort for a few years that comes and goes, depending on what I eat/drink. After cutting back on alcohol substantially (Less than 7 drinks per week), the discomfort is much less frequent.  I went to a gastroenterologist and had blood work done recently because of my symptoms (constipation and a change in bowel habit). I don't go to the bathroom for a week and then when I do it all comes out at once). I drink over the recommend amount of water and have a very high fiber diet. I take tums(maybe more than I should, but mostly keep to/under the limit on the bottle). If I do go to the bathroom during the week it is typically ball like clumps and I strain to produce them. I had a little blood in my stool/toilet paper (bright red, not dark), but also have a hemorrhoid that is very irritated from straining.  The bloodwork showed that I have anemia and HGB 12.7 and HCT 37.4. I am concerned because anemia in men is rare and anemia combined with constipation is a major red flag for colon cancer. I have a colonoscopy scheduled three weeks out, but in the mean time the fear of cancer has me very shaken. Is there anything else that it could be (or is more likely to be)?  Other info:  I'm very active and exercise 5 days per week.

We went back to the doctor and found out the surgery had slipped also the hiatal hernia that was repaired needed to be repaired again too. They suggested surgery again, so we did. Right after the 2nd operation things weren't the same. He was having cramping in his stomach. Six weeks post op he went back for a check up the doctor informed him that they nicked his diaphragm during surgery. During this visit we explained his getting sharp abdominal pains after eating then vomiting / diarrhea. As the time went on , the symptoms never really left. Some weeks it happens once or twice. Some weeks it happens 5-7 days. We have changed his diet, tried ruling out certain foods. In 2013 we had more procedures (endoscopy/colonoscopy) and discovered that previous 2nd surgery is now completely undone as well. They told us he may have nerve damage from the surgeries, can not correct the slip anymore it could permanently paralyze his stomach. We are still in the same position, same symptoms. He has had his gallbladder checked, blood work, swallow test, GI tests, stool samples, etc. No positive answers. Now it is getting to the point he has issues when the cramping happens he can't get somewhere quick enough. Typical time frame for him is eat food within 20-30 min sometimes less he is sick.

Unfortunately it has severely upset my stomach (I have been taking two 500mg tablets a day as recommended on the pack, although I was silly to sometimes take it on an empty stomach or two tablets at night rather than divide them in 2 doses as advised) so I have obviously stopped taking it as soon as I noticed the problem. There has been a slight improvement over the last month since I stopped (I am not drinking any coffee or smoking so I reckon magnesium levels in my body may still be high) but the problem persists. I've tried taking probiotics I've been recommended in my local health store but they don't help. I did some Google search and found that what I'm experiencing (bloating, abdominal pain, stomach cramps, struggling to digest most foods) is called hypermagnesemia and calcium injections are one of the treatments as they help remove excess magnesium from the body because calcium is a natural antagonist of magnesium. I don't find my condition that severe so that I should be going to the hospital for injections, I remember I had stomach issues because of magnesium supplement in the past and it has settled after a good while so I am sure it will be the same this time but I am looking for ways to speed up the process. My question is, do you think that drinking calcium in an effervescent form would be a good idea as another way of increasing my calcium intake to balance that high magnesium level in my body? Other option I found is to take digestive enzymes which would seem logical as my stomach takes ages to break down foods and is really sore while doing that, especially with bigger meals - could that be helpful?

I experienced these warts in Feb/March last year which was 5 months before I met my GF and she experienced these 3 months afterwards. These went unnoticed as warts up until early December, and she is now recieving treatment. I have never had any warts or symptoms since the first outbreak, but could still have the HPV virus in my system. I know that on average the immune system will clear the HPV virus after a year, which is roughly now. My girlfriend will only have had the virus for half of the time I have, and after clearing her first outbreak of warts she experienced another outbreak roughly 2 weeks afterwards. She is due to have these warts frozen off next week. What we would like to know, and these are questions we cannot get the answers too or find online, are the following things; 1. Will we keep on re-infecting each other with HPV through sexual contact? If I clear the HPV, can she re-infect me during sexual contact if she still has the virus? And if so, will I then go on to re-infect her when she clears the virus but I still have it? 2. My GF thinks that this second outbreak of warts is due to us having sexual contact after she cleared the first outbreak of warts, and that I myself have been the cause of the new outbreak of warts through either penetration or by use of my fingers. Is this possible when I do not have any warts myself? Is it the HPV virus she currently has that causes a re-occurence of warts? 3. Once the warts she currently has are frozen off, will they be gone for good or can they still re-appear after this type of treatment? This is a very hard strain on our relationship at present as we cannot find the answers to these questions anywhere.

I've been with the same man for the last six years currently, and the last I was with for seven. I have had two yeast infections, both while pregnant (2006 and 2008). While I was pregnant with my daughter (2006) my obgyn told me I had bacterial vaginosis. By the next time I had a pap smear just before I got pregnant with my son (2008) it came back normal. Because I was young and naive I didn't make annual pap smear appointments, my next one wasn't until about 2012-2013. That pap resulted in an abnormal cell count. This was at my local health department. Afterwards, I was advised to schedule an appointment for a colposcopy with a specialist. Well, much to my regret now, I didn't do anything about it. I barely make over minimum wage, have never had health insurance (other than Medicaid while I was pregnant with my children), I just naively chose to disregard it. Much to my amazement, the next time I went in for a pap, at the same health department (2014-2015), my results came back as normal, or as far as I know, they did, because I wasn't contacted or talked to about it afterwards. (I went there regularly for birth control) 2014-2015 was the last time I had an exam. A couple of months ago, and still today, I started experiencing a lot of itching down there. It's driving me crazy. I am also experiencing very light bleeding, but I do not know if the bleeding is from scratching so much or from something else. Sex isn't painful, but if I've been scratching recently, my urine will burn like hell. Most of the time it doesn't burn though. My discharge has mostly been clear and watery. To me it smells a bit off, but not necessarily foul. I thought it may have been a yeast infection at first, I went about two weeks ago and bought an over the counter one day treatment and it hasn't eased any symptoms, so I have checked that possibility off the list. I was feeling around a couple of days ago, and then I felt a small, rock hard like ball or lump at the top of my clitoris. Needless to say it scared the crap out of me! I have scheduled a pap for tomorrow at the health department. If anyone has went through this and has any reassuring words, they will be greatly appreciated. It's difficult for me to get through the work day right now, as I am constantly thinking about it!

Please let me know I'm not alone in this. I've been suffering with ""IBS-D"" since early 2006. My story begins as most do, Once Upon a Time, I was just fine. In 2006 I underwent surgery to remove my right Fallopian tube and ovary. During the procedure, the surgeon noticed that 6"" of my small intestine had collapsed. Concerned that severe complications would undoubtedly arise; the damaged intestine was removed and reattached. Recovery was unremarkable; outside of the NG Tube (which should be outlawed), and I went home a few days later. And so it begins, a few days after I began to experience intense spasms in my stomach; so much so that they come in waves so severe that I become nauseated and begin to vomit; cold sweats and to make it more complicated...severe diarrhea. I returned to the ER where I was admitted, given pain meds and Zofran, rehydrated, CT scan showed nothing. A few days later, discharged. Diarrhea has been my constant companion since. And to make it worse there is no holding it back. It has a mind of it's own and once started if I can't find a bathroom in 30 seconds or less; I'm a ""poopy-pants""! Fast forward to January 2017, admitted to the hospital again for the same symptoms (this is the fifth time).

In researching the IBS-D pharmaceutical options; the side effects of the drugs is at best; frightening. I knew about what could happen with Lotronex; I signed a ""waiver"" to start the drug. At this time desperation made it impossible to see anything but no more ""poopy-pants"" at work, shopping, driving, etc. I'm desperate!

I took the iron pill/prenatal and got diarrhea so I stopped taking them. Fast forward a few months and I got strep throat. I started to take amoxicillin I had left from another prescription, but when that didn't work I called my doctor who prescribed me a zpack. Once I finished the 5 days, I thought back on my iron pills and thought maybe I had that reaction because I hadn't taken it with food so I took the iron/prenatals again with food this time. The day after I had the craziest diarrhea. This lasted for about 6 days. After that the diarrhea became less severe but had blood in it. I called my doctor who couldnt fit me in so I went to a clinic. They did testing (c-dif and general stool test) everything came back negative. Finally I got in with my reg doctor who prescribed me hydrocortisone thinking it was a superficial tear, but I am almost positive the blood is internal (bright red but I am dont think its a hemorrhoid as I dont have any discomfort and the blood seems mixed in with the stool).","IBD , Irritable Bowel Syndrome"

Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/5330/location-specific-ibs,Location specific IBS?,"Hi, This is a very weird question. I have relatively mild symptoms that are often associated with Irritable Bowel Syndrome: bloating, gas, very loose stools (sometimes after every meal), and the feeling that I can't completely void my bowels. I say these are relatively mild because they're never bad enough to stop me from going out in public, for example. Ok. Now for the weird part: they happen only where I live - in the DC area. If I go away, they cease immediately. E.g., I'm now in Pittsburgh. I arrived last night. I spent the whole day yesterday in the DC area - including Virginia and Maryland suburbs. I had pretty bad symptoms - lots of gas, and strange loose stools after meals. These all disappeared almost immediately after arriving (by car) in Pittsburgh last night. I've eaten anything I want today, and everything has been completely normal - no symptoms. But this is just an example. It happens whenever I leave the DC area. I've tried different diets. I don't drink tap water at all in the DC area. But still the symptoms return when I return home. I have no idea how this could be. There seems to be no correlation with any type of food or drink I put in my gut. The only correlation is with whether or not I'm in the DC area. If I travel far enough away - I often go to Canada, Pittsburgh, Europe - all symptoms disappear. Any thoughts?",

When she was only 3 days old, we took her to a hospital for jaundice. In the baby care room, a lady who saw me struggling to wake up the baby to breastfeed helped me. She said she had four kids and seemed quite experienced and helpful. Exhausted and sleep-deprived, I did not react. She held the baby and told me I should remove some of her clothing to help wake her up, and she removed her pants, she saw her diaper said that it was not put on properly, she opened and readjusted the diaper before I could stop her. She then showed me how to swaddle. At that moment I looked up at her face and saw that she had a cold sore. I was shocked. I told her. She said she had washed her hands as she had also breastfeed her own child. But I cannot stop obsessing since that day.  Sorry that it has been a long story, but I am extremely worried that my baby may have caught genital HSV1 from that woman. What if she touched her cold sore without me or her realizing and then her face or worse-her genital area while adjusting the diaper? I have read that it is possible to give a baby genital HSV1 from a cold sore during a diaper change. I also read that the droplets in saliva could also cause transmission. I have had cold sores before so I think I may have passed some oral HSV1 antibodies to my baby, but I don't know if this would protect her against genital HSV1. So far, she hasn't shown any symptoms, but I read that there may be no symptoms for years. I suffer from OCD and am extremely worried. I cannot enjoy my days with my beautiful days due to this uncertainty. What if my baby has caught a lifetime genital STD because of my momentary lapse of judgment. I cannot live with the guilt and the unknown.  To sum up, is it possible for a baby to catch HSV1 orally or genitally in the way I desribed. How likely is it?

Can be sharp sometimes and radiate into right shoulder. Longest stint of pain was 4 - 5 days. Worse after eating - burping and trapped air which causes sharp pain in my back - Reflux is so bad that food gets stuck on its way down my food pipe and throat hurts a lot in general - consistently yellow stools - been like that for years now - Frequent 'IBS-like' symptoms - bloating, sharp cramps, intolerance to fatty heavy foods I've had the following tests... - x2 gastroscopy (gastritis and biopsies showed inflammation) - x1 colonoscopy - clear  - H pylori breath tests - clear - Fecal elastase to check pancreas function - clear - Parasite testing - clear - x3 ultrasounds - all clear - HIDA scan - around 78%  - various blood tests (LFT, renal profile, CBC etc etc) - all clear apart from a slightly high white blood count during my worst time of pain - food intolerance testing (celiac, lactose etc) - all clear  - MRCP - all clear Here's what I've tried... - lifestyle changes: I've cut out fatty, fizzy, acidic and spicy foods, eating smaller and more frequent meals, elevating pillows at bedtime, not wearing tight clothing, not bending down after meals, not eating too close to bedtime, stopped drinking alcohol, chewing food properly and thoroughly - omeprazole, esomeprazole, rantidine, gaviscon advanced - no help at all - cut out gluten and dairy for months - no help - digestive enzymes, ginger tablets, silicolgel, cold milk, ginger beer - apercap, colpermin, mebeverine, amitriptyline, prozac, buscopan - apple cider vinegar, ginger tablets, chamomile tea, milk thistle - beet juice, potato juice, parsley and all the good stuff for gallbladders Sooooo totally running out of options here.

A few days ago, I strained a lot when having a bowel movement and at that moment felt a dull pain around the vagina/uterus area. The next day, after walking, I started bleeding vaginally. It was mostly brown, a bit of red; later during the day I had a cramp-like pain in the lower stomach and in the back (which usually happens when I have a ""period""). It lightened throughout the day, but stayed. The next day, same thing, light at home, brown and red after walking, then very wet and a pinkish/red, stayed and lightened throughout the day; had an easy bowel movement in the evening. Yesterday I woke up and thought the bleeding was pretty much done (vaginal mucous still not clear). Had a bowel movement in the morning, still just lightly colored mucous. About 2 hours later, the bleeding started again, this time completely red and very wet. I thought it might be the start of a ""period"" or breakthrough bleeding because I took my birth control half an hour late a few days earlier.  I checked my cervix last night, it was semi-hard (like it usually is on birth control), but also felt a bit thin, and was open with a lot of mucous at the opening (lightly brown). This morning, mucous still a bit discolored; checked cervix again and it felt a bit dryer and more rounded and closed. Lightly discolored mucous in morning, but I thought it was fine and that it must just have been breakthrough bleeding. Then I had a bowel movement (no straining), and right away I was bleeding; very red, very wet and slippery. It kept up throughout the day, and is only now starting to lighten. Cervix again  Did I tear or dislodge something when I strained too much with the bowel movement a few days ago? I know it's possible to develop a prolapsed pelvic floor if you strain the area too much, but I thought this was over time; could it have happened after just one time? Is it because of the breakthrough bleeding and the straining together? Or might I have some sort of polyp or cyst?",Women's Issues

I'm an 18-year-old girl and I'm a virgin; so it confuses me when all of a sudden my vagina started to itch and I get daily discharge, too. Sometimes, they're clear; sometimes, they're a little bit greenish. It began in November 2016, and a few days after I started to feel the itch, my genital started to feel sore and it was just so itchy I couldn't sleep and was basically just trying to hold myself from throwing a tantrum. I got myself checked and the doctor gave me meds that didn't really work; because I can't say that I got myself REALLY checked. The gynecologist was supposed to check me down there and do a swab test, but since I'm a virgin and I was scared to have something inside me, so instead of getting it fully inside me, she didn't. The results say I don't have yeast infection, so idk what I have. I'm really scared and paranoid because this has been going on for almost 3 months now. I went to the doctor last week and she gave me 2 strong meds that sadly didn't work. (I had my period when I went to her clinic so she didn't check me down there.) I've also noticed that before my period starts, I get bloody discharge. (December and this month only, though). I'm going back to the doctor again this Monday, Jan.30/2017, and she'll check me out. I'll also have a transrectal which is scaring me as hell. I'm so scared, guys.

Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/4612/multiple-capsule-endoscopies-stuck,Multiple Capsule Endoscopies Stuck,"Three years ago, I randomly had a stricture in my small bowel that required resection. My doctors at the time were unable to ever find an answer as to what caused it and ultimately wrote it off as a freak occurrence that hopefully won't happen again. Then about a year ago, it was discovered that I was very anemic. My previous surgeon ordered an EGD, colonoscopy, small bowel follow through and around February, a capsule endoscopy, to no avail. He referred me to a hematologist, who started me on iron infusions. I received the infusions once a week for about 5 or 6 months. My iron did eventually climb to normal levels, but once the infusions were stopped, my numbers fell quickly. The doctor ordered yet another capsule endoscopy in August, but says it showed no results. Microscopic traces of blood were found in my occult stool sample, but my doctor kept telling me that we'll wait and see what happens.  I finally scheduled myself an appointment with a gastroenterologIst in the fall and he conducted his own EGD and colonoscopy, which again showed nothing. He finally ordered a third capsule endoscopy, which I completed about 2 weeks ago.  His nurse practitioner called me today and said that there is an ulcer in my small intestine along with another stricture. She said that my capsule came to a stop in my small bowel and was worried that it might be stuck, so she ordered an x-ray for me to get quickly along with some additional blood work. After taking the x-rays, the tech informed me that there are THREE foreign objects inside of my small bowel. When I told him about the capsule studies, he confirmed that that is what he saw - all THREE of them from over this past year, stuck inside me.  I'm waiting on the doctor's office to receive the report and contact me to see what I need to do from here. So now, I'm not only worried of what condition is causing all of this, but I now have to worry about the 3 capsules inside my small bowel. How did the previous doctor not notice that the capsule came to a halt during BOTH studies and maybe suggest getting an x-ray to make sure I passed them. I feel like a fool for not taking it upon myself to check it out.  My question is: has anyone ever experienced or heard of anyone having multiple capsules stuck like this? Is this an emergency issue or could it become one? I will be talking to my doctors office tomorrow I'm sure, but in the mean time, I'm a little nervous about everything.","Crohn's Disease , Ulcers , Bloating"

I've eliminated alcohol and junk-food from my diet and added more exercise into my life, But while these adjustments have lead to many positive physical improvements in my body, sexual performance isn't one of them.  After lots of research on effective ways to combat anti-depressant induced sexual dysfunction, I purchased a bottle of L-Citrulline pills (1200mg). Yesterday was my first day taking them. I took 3 pills throughout the day for a grand total dose of roughly 3.5 Grams (From my research, the recommended dosage of L-Citrulline for ED is 3g.)  I experienced some incredible results shortly after taking the 3rd pill at night.  It's my understanding that L-Citrulline is converted into L-Arginine in the body, and that elevated levels L-Arginine can cause a person to experience a herpes outbreak such as cold sores or shingles.  Now, I'm fully aware that most adults have some form of herpes- But I've never had a cold sore in my life, although I did have the chicken pox as a child.  Most of the horror stories I've read on the internet regarding herpes outbreaks are from people using Arginine supplements with/without citrulline, but I'm still curious: Q: Does anyone know what the input/output ration is when L-Citrulline is converted to L-Arginine in the body? (How much L-Arginine is created by the body per Gram of L-Citrulline?)

A couple weeks later I developed a burning pain underneath my left buttock where my underwear sits. It started to also occur in my right buttock with occasional feelings like a hair is being pulled or a bug bite. The burning felt sort of like a sunburn but there was nothing physically there and it doesn't hurt to touch. I was very paranoid that it could be related to herpes. Long story short, I saw two gyns about it who both said I didn't have it and got tested 1 month and 3 months after the encounter, both blood tests were negative. Had a nerve test done as well which was also negative. The pain went away after about two months. I stopped worrying about it. I was in a relationship afterwards. Nothing ever came up between us. I broke up with that person recently and about a week later my symptoms returned. Its been a year and a half since the first symptoms appeared. Should I get retested? Could this just be in my head?

I went to the doctors yesterday and he told me it was the ""stomach flu"" and ordered a blood test so I'll see the results in about a week. In the mean time, I've made a list of my lifestyle choices to find the culprit. 1) I'm a frequent marijuana smoker for only a couple months as it helps with my ADD more than Adderall; 2) I've been prescribed Adderall for years but that has never made me feel like this and I prefer marijuana anyways so I don't use it as often; 3) The Adderall makes me skip meals sometimes like once every week; 4) I'm ashamed to say this but I've been downing like 12+ gummy vitamins everyday for the past 2 months (I THINK THIS MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT). I've been researching the symptoms of vitamin overdose and it sounds like what I've been having. Could vitamin overdose make me gag in the morning then subside at night and could it affect me for this long (a week)?

The last time that I experienced this sensation from masturbating without a condom, I went to the doctor and tested negative for a UTI and the sensation went away in about a month or so. Does anyone have any idea what this could be?  Any feedback/response is welcome and greatly appreciated. Thanks",Men's Issues

I am a 50 year old lady who is married to a man with erectile dysfunction. I haven't been sexually active for 3 years (and have only slept with my husband and ex-husband who was unfaithful). I have just been diagnosed with herpes type1 and am a bit shell-shocked and embarrassed. I am on my second course of anti virals (as the breakouts don't seem to be disappearing) but I have a question ... Does my husband need to be checked out? He has a lot of facial cold sores at times (but we have never had oral sex - sorry too much information I know). He is never likely to have sex with anyone else - I suppose my question is - will a diagnosis mean that he gets different treatment from his over the counter ointment that he buys for his cold sores.

Although, I'm having a hard time dealing with what's going on in my GI track. For the past couple years, drs thought the pain and sickness was from endometriosis And cysts on my ovary. Ok. I get a cyst removed. Not it. A year later, another removed. Later, an ovary removed. Then they decided it's time to remove my female parts. They put me on birth control to help with the cysts. Only for me to get pregnant. Because I'm sick all the time I can hardly take care of the two children I have how am I going to take care of three. But being the person I am I keep the baby. As my tummy grew larger I was about seven months pregnant and I noticed on the ultrasound a huge mass. I asked the ultrasound lady what that was and her response was ""I'm not sure I brought that to the nurses attention last time it looks like it is on your colon, but they said there's nothing they can do about it until baby is born."" Once baby was born you could not see it anymore I don't know if it's because you could only see it because my stomach was larger or what. Problems continue and then they removed my female parts. Well problems continue but they are actually worse. I am on week three with no bowel movement. I've done for animals to suppositories I've drink the stuff they told me to and nothing. To the hospital twice did their enema and nothing. It feels like I have the flu all the time. It disrupts my life time with my children and my fiancé.

Told me I need to get my esophagus stretched out every four months since it closes sometimes when I eat. I did all the tests. My pancreas is fine.

It has gotten especially worse for me recently though. I have always had to take a shower immediately following a bowel movement, and that routing usually took 1.5-2 hours. Now the whole thing takes me anywhere from 3.5-5 hours. Anyways, when I wipe, I use baby wipes. They get me much cleaner and it's much more comfortable on my skin back there than toilet paper or other wipes, which don't get me clean enough. Now at the end of my wiping routine, I am going in deep into my hole, and the wipes either just have blood on them, or they have blood plus a sort of mucus looking clear substance. It's usually spread out no further than the size of a penny, but most of the time it is smaller than that. So my question is, what is this clear substance? When I see it on the wipe, it makes me think I am not clean enough, so I have to wipe until I see only blood alone on the wipe, or nothing at all. This has caused my BM/wiping process to get much longer than it used to be. Is there any kind of fecal matter contained in the clear stuff? Is there any reason for me to feel unclean if I were to stop wiping once I only see blood and clear stuff? For further information, I will say it's probable that I have some form of IBS, although I have never been diagnosed as such. My BMs are usually solid, although I have the occasional loose stool probably once a week, with diarrhea happening around 3-4 times per month. I frequently have stomach cramps, which I take a GasX in response to, but this seems to have limited efficacy. I recently (as in this past week) started taking a probiotic supplement again. I took a daily probiotic in the past, and it seemed to help somewhat, but I got off of it probably midway through 2016. I tried a different brand, it says it has a billion cultures per serving so I hope that will help me. Anyways, my main question/concern here is the clear stuff in my anus.

Sexual Health & STDs,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/2502/how-soon-should-i-get-genital-moles-checked,How soon should I  get genital moles checked?,"About six months ago I noticed a mole on the lower shaft of my penis that wasn't there before. It was the same brown color and shape as other moles on my body and it didn't hurt, so I didn't get it checked out.  This week I noticed two more small brown moles growing at the base in addition to a skin tag in the pubic hair. The skin tag was bleeding this morning, but I think it's just because I handled it roughly when I was examining it. Although, I know it's a bad sign if these things bleed. I should also say that I got an STD test (blood and urine) about a year ago and I tested negative for everything. I'm in a relationship and haven't slept with anyone else. My girlfriend got tested two or three months ago and her results were all negative as well. Is the HPV test a separate test from the standard blood and urine tests? My problem is that I'm going to be in the United States for another month and I only have basic universal health care coverage here. In February, I'll be back in France where I am fully covered.  Is this the type of thing that I should get checked out immediately? Or can it wait a month?","HPV/Genital Warts , Men's Issues"
Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/3021/i-am-tired-of-food-making-me-sick,I am tired of food making me sick.,"This is my first post and it is kind of a long story so bare with me... I'll try to make it as short as possible. Throughout my childhood, i've NEVER had any stomach issues. I was always able to eat any and everything and be fine no matter what. No allergies or intolerances, i loved food and i'd eat an entire jar of edys ice cream within one day. I'd get occassional stomach aches but i would be able to drink some ginger ale and shake it off within a matter of hours. Even that was rare. i've always had anxiety but that never truly affected me. Now, when i was 15, which was toward the ending of 2013, I caught a really bad stomach virus for the first time. After about a few days i still wasnt able to shake it off and even water was making me sick. WATER. So with that i lost about 10lbs. Which is alot because i am tiny anyhow. I was suffering for WEEKS with nausea vomiting and abdominal pain. Then i finally saw a g.i and planned an endoscopy begining of 2014. They found that my stomach lining had scars due to excessive acid and they pretty much chalked it down to acid reflux. OMEPRAZOLE had little effect and i was on it for months. Then i got allergy tested and it was found that i was lactose intolerant (Never had any problems with dairy before) Switched to an organic diet and i still had bloating and nausea even after eating a little bit. 2015 i was fine. still not 100%, but fine.  Last year 2016 I randomly had an unexplainable flare up around my birthday, March. I was still organic but occasionally i'd cheat. Even grapes and water was making me sick/nauseous and i had severe belly pain. It took me almost two months to feel at least a little well, but the symptom that has stuck with me was early satiety. Even half a sandwhich would make me feel full and bloaty. Fast forward to this past november, i wake up one morning and literally everything made me sick. I tried to force feed myself because I know i have to eat but it only made matters worse and with that, i havent had a full meal since early november. Then i started noticing that food i never had a problem with before, magically became a problem (Such as rice, bread, meat, soup) basically EVERYTHING. i was living off crackers cookies and juice. NOW JANUARY,  starting on JANUARY 1ST, i caught ANOTHER BAD STOMACH VIRUS THAT THREW MY SYSTEM FOR A LOOP. I literally havent ate much since then and ive lost 20lbs, now im 99lbs. ive only had water, popsicles, cheerios (which made me sick) and sunflower seeds. I was starting to feel better last friday. I was still nauseous after eating CLEAR SOUP. CLEAR SOUP!!!!!!!. However, one of my doctors insisted that I had functional ibs dyspepsia since every test came out NEGATIVE, she insisted my anxiety was part of the problem, so they decied to prescribe me zoloft 50 mg. BIG MISTAKE. I had the WORST reaction EVER to that stuff and since then, i felt sick to my stomach, dizzy, headachey, twitchy, agitated etc. I havent ate since the night  i took that second dose (friday). Of course I discontinued it but now I feel even more anxious and depressed than ever before. I tried to eat yesturday but my body started feeling sick and i started shaking.  I JUST WANT THIS TO END. ALMOST 4 YEARS OF AGONY AND I WANT IT ALL TO STOP.","GERD and Heartburn , Ulcers , Irritable Bowel Syndrome , Bloating , Ulcerative Colitis"

I have flat warts from one of these types of HPV (don't know which one, pretty sure its not HPV-49, as that is a pretty rare form), and not the genital type- I've never gotten it on my genitalia. Several sites have told me that these types of HPV are considered ""low-risk"", but then others say flat warts can increase your odds of getting cancer. I guess in conclusion, my question is if cancer can develop from flat warts or at the least am I at greater risk of cancer? Thank you.",HPV/Genital Warts
