It's very odd as supposedly it's a great way to destroy   with minimal down time. It's a minimal laparoscopic procedure that destroys the fibroids but supposedly doesn't use morcellation which is dangerous. Yet very few doctors seem to do it when I Googled for more info. It was on the TV show The Doctors a few years ago, but not much other info out there now than the main site. And no OBGYN has ever mentioned it to me as an option. Wondering, is it a scam? Has anyone heard of it or tried it? It sounds like it would be a great option if it were safe and affordable. Yet if it were safe and affordable you think there would be more folks talking about it. Thanks ladies. 0 likes, 5 replies "
Uterine Fibroids,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-true-success-story-am-pregnant-thanks-to-patient-info-and-her-members--692877,MY TRUE SUCCESS STORY. AM PREGNANT!😀.Thanks to patient.info and her members.,"Hallo everyone, I have a true story to share with you all. Am 32 years, got married with no issue. 2016 I was diagnosed with multiple fibroids, had laparoscopy in July 2017 after then we have been TTC but to no avail. we were so worried that I had to make up my mind for a major operation in Nov 2018 because the gynecologist said having an IVF I have just 30% chance of it surviving with the fibroids. There is nothing God can not do if you believe. I cried and pray always to an extent I call my parents to pray for me too. I stay in Germany with my husband. I was on femibion and vit.D for almost a year then I stopped and started taking a tablet which contains iron,vit. B12 and C, and follic acid. I took for just 2 months and the miracle happened. I went to see my gyne to prepare me for an open in September 2018 she checked me with the scan and booked the surgery for November, all this while I was expecting to see my monthly flow which never came then we ran a test. to my greatest surprise it was positive😊. I and my husband went to the hospital for a confirmation it came out positive. my gyne called my case extraordinary pregnant with multiple fibroids and endometriosis. But as the pregnancy occur the endometriosis is gone and the fibroids remains. I am 21 weeks 3days today. I want to encourage everyone out there to hang on and trust God he made it possible. nevertheless the Journey still continues for me until it is over. I just don't want to keep it to myself but to let other ladies who have similar problem with me not to give up now. be strong and we will cross the bridge. be free to ask questions or send me messages to my inbox. stay strong, stay healthy.... 3 likes, 14 replies "
Uterine Fibroids,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/be-aware-of-ufe-post-symptoms-lost-all-sexual-sensation-i-am-seriously-depressed-about-it--668010,"BE aware of UFE post symptoms - lost all sexual sensation, I am seriously depressed about it.","Hello, I am a 49yrs old and for what seems all my life I suffered from heavy periods, it was not until I was in my late 30's I was told I had fibroids after an MRI and ultrasound confirmed it. When I was told about the fibroids the Dr made it seem like it was just part of aging. ""Nothing to worry about, they're just part of aging like we get wrinkles or grey hair. It's very common at this age"" I thought nothing of it, but like I said I have ALWAYS have had the heavy 7-9-10 day periods since I was blessed with the curse of menstruating at the age of 11. What I did not realize was that tiny grape size fibroids would continue to grow and that they spread. Fast forward to me at 49, three children later, tied tubes after the 3rd child was born in the late 20's and still suffering from heavy, debilitating periods. I was losing my hair, energy depleted, mood swings from dealing with living with a 2 week period every month and its symptoms. I finally went searching to find a permanent solution to my problem with a new Dr. An ultrasound and another MRI taken, confirmed that the 6 fibroids I had were massive, 3 being the sizes of tangerines. I FREAKED OUT!  She has me try an IUD, did not work, moved around in my large uterus, we had to remove it. She strongly suggests a hysterectomy since I am no longer in my childbearing years and it would stop all the problems. I was so terrified about the surgery and all its consequences like the menopause symptoms, bladder issues, sexual misfunction issues that I looked endlessly for another option and found UFE. After several consultations with my Dr, I scheduled the procedure with great excitement to have some relief.  Surgery went as planned, 8 am surgery w/ an overnight stay. Waking up from the procedure I was immediately sick. I was spinning, extremely dizzy and vomiting whenever I was awake. I am very sensitive to narcotics and was given a very strong narcotic while asleep to help with pain recovery. It was awful. It was so awful that they had to put me on oxygen through the night to help my system clear the drug out. I was hooked up to the IV to maintain my hydration since I could not hold down a sip of anything. I had the catheter inserted all night. FUN CITY!! It was a tough night. The vomiting subsided the next day early in the morning around 9 am and that is when the pain hit me so hard. To describe it...it felt like someone was stabbing me. The sharpest, most intense pain that trickled down my legs and up my stomach and electrified my entire midsection. IT WAS WORSE THAN LABOR! ( I bore 3 large children all being close to 10 lbs, in a 105 lb original body frame that eventually led to C-sections due to babies size and still, the pain form this procedure was more intense) It actually felt like constant labor pains, the way the back and legs hurt. I had to stay monitored and have my pain pills every 5hrs on the dot or else the pain was unbearable. Then the painful consequence of taking pain meds and lack of movement for 24 hrs hit and the constipation was awful. The urge to go was definitely there but nothing was moving. I even ate very light food a couple of days beforehand anticipating it hoping that it would help but it took me an entire 5 days to actually pass a BM. That was awful for me since I kept telling myself it was the pain pills that were doing that to me so I tried not to take as many but then the pain was so unbearable I had to take the meds in order not to feel like I was being stabbed in the gut. That is where I believe I made my mistake. I refused to take the strong pain meds prescribed, the Percocet. I was prescribed Percocet every 4-5 hrs and the 500 ml of Ibuprofen every 4- hrs or as needed. I refused to take the Percocet at all because of my constipation and fear of pain pills, they make me ill and sleepy. I now realize that if I did take both meds as prescribed, I would not have been in such pain. I just wanted to know how I felt and what my body was feeling and how it was healing and I just did not want to numb myself and not know when I was truly better. It took me approx 17 days for the pain to finally subside completely. This is while faithfully taking the Ibuprofen as prescribed. The days after the surgery I was passing tissue constantly, large masses of tissue that would just come out while using the restroom. I found that sitting on the toilet and letting my body have time to let everything come out was best. I was afraid that I would get an infection if all that would not come out. It was gross, large tissue masses along with blood clots. I took it as a sign that the fibroids were dying as they should and were exiting my body. After the 17 days the pain stopped and I was overjoyed not to have to be on the ibuprofen. The continuous spotting and pieces of tissue still passed for 30 days or so here and there so I was always wearing a pad. It was not heavy, it was erratic here and there throughout the days.  FIVE WEEKS AFTER SURGERY is when I decide to have sex. I am still lightly spotting and that is when the fear struck me. I was having what seemed to be a PMS symptom. My breasts were extremely tender all of a sudden, my nipples hurt so badly that the slightest touch hurt, my bra was uncomfortable. That is the only symptom though, no cramps, no bloating or period. I was missing intimacy with my husband after 5 weeks of no sex, sex is a very important part of my happiness and stability. Being with my husband had a way of balancing me and it was almost a daily part of my life, at 25 years of marriage its always what kept me happy and I needed it and when I finally felt my body was healed. I had sex and instantly was horrified at the lack of sensation. I could feel he was inside me but the electricity of sexual arousal was not happening. To describe it would be like when you go to the dentist and you know and feel the touch on your face from the pressure only but not the sensation. It scared me and now 3 months after the surgery, I am still numb. I cannot reach a climatic orgasm, just a very short, outer clitorial tiny orgasm that is best achieved with oral sex and not with intercourse. Nothing at all to what I used to feel before. I also lack any desire what so ever, my body does not react to excitement. I do not feel any arousal at all and I am devastated and so sad and so frustrated that I do not know what to do. I have emailed my Dr. (I also would like to remind everyone that a gynecologist does not perform the surgery. My gynecologist did not perform it, it was a radiologist who performs the surgery. The only time I ever felt this numbness was during the awful experience I had with the 3-month birth control shot Deprovera. She told me that sometimes numbness can occur for 5-6 months post surgery. THAT IS WHY I AM HERE POSTING THIS LONG STORY HOPING SOMEONE CAN RELATE AND THAT THEY EXPERIENCED THIS AND IT GOT BETTER WITH TIME. I am hoping to hear from someone telling me that the sensation will return. I am absolutely terrified that somehow the surgery and the blood blockage to my uterus affected my ability to reach orgasm forever.  PLEASE SHARE ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL ME IF THIS HAS HAPPENED TO YOU.  I also wanted to note that I have not really had a period since the surgery other than 2-3 days of very light spotting when I should have had my period. It's so odd for me not to bleed all I have to use is a panty liner now, that what is happening. So as far as the bleeding it is gone, not sure if I am going into menopause now?? I am 49. I got tested on my FSH levels before surgery, and was told I was nowhere near it, my mom lost her period at 56. So the procedure I guess did do what it's supposed to?? Going in next month for an ultrasound to see how much the fibroids have shrunk. I am praying that in time I will feel again, and am horrified at the mere notion that I may never again. WHAT HAVE I DONE IF THIS IS FOREVER!!    Please share any insights to this if you can relate. Thank you for your time. 0 likes, 5 replies "
Uterine Fibroids,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/persistent-discharge-but-no-pain--689220,Persistent Discharge but no pain!,"Hi All, Your posts are so helpful and I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart as I feel so alone. I really do not have a support system and since what you describe with both yellow & bloody discharge is what is happening to me, I am wondering if the situation resolved for you all. Just to give you some background, I am 34 and was diagnosed with 3 fibroids, dominant one being 11cm and in the posterior uterine wall (very weird position) plus 2 very small ones on the right (nobody could even tell me if they are considered submucosal or what, not even the MRI report - you guys are correct that the medical profession is so limited in its way of handling this and their knowledge is laughable.) A recap of my situation: UFE surgery on Aug 21, 2018 - No discharge for the first 2 weeks after the procedure - and very little pain - The 3rd week after procedure I had gone back to work and discharge started light - sometimes brown and others yellow, NOT persistent and only every few days - light pantyliners were sufficient and I never used tampons since they told me I should avoid any risk of introducing bacteria. Since Dec 4, 2018 to present (Dec 21, 2018), I am having yellow foul-smelling discharge NON STOP / every single day and it is heavy in flow but fluid/watery, not very thick. This makes me think my cervix is not wide enough to allow the fibroid(s) to pass through it so only the uterine wall is shedding (but this is an assumption which is why I need medical MRI confirmation to see if the big fibroid looks like it needs to expel vaginally.) I immediately contacted the radiologist who performed UFE and they dismissed me saying ""they are not gynecologists"" and I should go to my gynecologist who can perform a pelvic exam. Problem is - gyno's know nothing about radiology and vice versa! (In my mind also thinking: you radiologist were quick to take my money and insurance money but now do not want any of the subsequent complication responsibilities from the procedure you performed!) The gynecologist said ""it does not look like BP (Bacterial Vaginosis,) and I do not know if it is a degenerating fibroid"" Overall, she was unable to properly diagnose this. She, along with many other gynecologists I have met, have ALWAYS been much more set on myomectamy instead of UFE so she was quick to suggest I go to a surgeon/oncologist who would just put a knife to the problem and cut the fibroids out, and after everything I have gone through with UFE I truly do not want any invasive procedure if fibroids are dead I just want them to slide out!!!! I have had regular periods every month since the procedure - but since the constant discharge started, I had a really heavy and much more ""fluid"" period, heavier in terms of the amount of blood, but the consistency of bloos was literally like water - typically, my period blood is thicker but this time it is like a fluid, both the discharge fluid and the blood are extremely ""watery"" - was the discharge and blood always thicker for you? I had it thicker a week ago and now it is super fluid. Please let me know how things ended up for you!) I never had children and also read that women who previously had children pass dead fibroids much more easily because the cervix might open easier, whereas those who never gave birth might need to be under anesthesia and the doc helps the fibroids out by having a hysteroscopic resection or alternatively a D&C, are either of these significant surgery? I do not want to go through anything else if I do not have to! I do not feel pain AT ALL so this is all very confusing to me, it is a painless heavy blood/discharge flow that impacts my every day, I have to run to the bathroom every 30 min to change pads and avoid staining office and board room chairs! It literally is impossible to keep going on like this. I keep asking for an MRI but the radiology dept where I got UFE  keeps saying my situation is ""not an emergency"" and I am ""likely expelling degenerating fibroid"" and they do not want me to do the MRI until March 2019, because it takes that long to see peak shrinkage, although I am honestly not even concerned with the size of dominant fibroid still being large, I know it is big and I understand it will likely will not shrink from UFE; and if I am lucky it will stop growing (that was the goal all along), but the purpose of my request for MRI is to determine the cause of this persistent discharge and if at this point it needs further intervention (I HOPE NOT) and also to confirm that the fibroid is in fact no longer receiving blood supply because if it is, then the UFE was unsuccessful. The gyno observed that the discharge did not look like BV (Bacterial Vaginosis,) but just to be sure prescribed a cream which is supposed to kill any bacteria - this is however not an antibiotic but simply a cream for use within the cervix for 7 days. Honestly I feel like doctors could not care less about these discharge issues and I am scared of using this random cream because of what I read here where it makes the discharge worse, and before UFE I was told to literally avoid inserting ANYTHING for risk of bacteria and infection - they even told me to avoid taking a BATH because of this! And now I am supposed to stick a tube up my cervix because of this misdiagnosis? I have literally never in my life had discharge like this so the chances of it being BV are seriously slim to none. Plus other women reported the cream did not stop the discharge. I feel very dismissed, I ask for help and nobody knows what to do and it is truly frightening. The fact that I am not in any pain, but just feel exhausted - seems to be the reason why doctors do not care what is happening to me. Do I just have to live with chronic discharge and heavy periods. By the way, for my entire life before UFE, I have never had a period this heavy - my fibroid symptoms used to be bulk issues, pressure on bladder - but my periods were truly brief (4 days) and non painful. Not to mention the financial burden of buying such a high amount of pads, liners, wipes, heavy period items, absorbents, none of which are covered by insurance. I also read that after UFE, discharge could be chronic due to a superficial cavity within the infarcted fibroid tumor that communicates with the endometrial cavity through a hole in the endometrium. This situation is indicated by a specific appearance on TII sagittal magnetic resonance images (again why the MRI is needed but nobody will have me do it). Hysteroscopic resection of the necrotic fibroid tumor was usually curative with other women who had this, but I really do not want to go through anything else, if not absolutely necessary. I wish someone could just tell me - deal with this for 1-2 months and you should be fine after that! How long did discharge last and does it ALWAYS end with fibroid expulsion? In my case discharge is so watery it makes me think I will not expel anything solid, but I am still curious about you guys - is the expulsion of a fibroid painful? I have experienced a miscarriage and that was atrociously painful. But nobody will tell me if this is what is to be expected! Please let me know how you are!

In fact, I even fear the   might have grown during the treatment as I feel them more with certain movements. My belly also looks bigger - I think.  While the side effects have been pretty mild (with the excerption of the occasional hot flash and nigh sweats), I feel like I have bloated since started this medication. I run 30km per week, strenght train 5x/wk and eat carbs once a day. Yet I cant seem to get ahead of the weight.

If so, how long did you have to take it to see results. I wasn't expectign quick fix, but I feel 5-6months is enough time for a medication to work, i.e. if it will at all.

Uterine Fibroids,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/fibroids-my-open-myomectomy-story-697216,Fibroids - My open myomectomy story,"Hey ladies, I would like to share my experience with you on My Open Myomectomy, please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. On the 4th July 2018 I had an open myomectomy, aged 33 with no kids. Just in case anyone is not familiar with this procedure, an abdominal myomectomy is a major surgical procedure. It involves making an incision through the skin at the lower abdomen, known as a ""bikini cut,"" and removing the fibroid tumors from inside the wall of the uterus. The uterine muscle is then sewn back together using several layers of stitches. Yes I know it sound horrid, well that's what I went through...and what an experience it was!!!  Tumors can also be encouraged by stress, I went through a very stressful time in my life which i believe contributed to the growth of the tumors. Unfortunately I didn’t know they were present and my situation at the time caused them to grow rapidly in size due to the amount of stress my body was under. I began to experience heavy periods early last year which was not normal for me as I usually had light periods lasting for 3-4 days, they became so heavy and painful causing me to loose up to 1 litre of blood in 3-4 days lasting up to 5. I began to feel extremely weak, faint and was rushed to hospital almost every month due to the amount of blood loss. I was leaking through clothes, having to use the thickest sanitary pads available which still wasn’t enough for the amount of blood being lost. My doctor began to monitor me and I was sent for blood tests which showed I became extremely anaemic and had a worrying vitamin D deficiency, I was then given a vitamin D supplement and Tranesamic acid to thin the blood, both had no impact on the situation. I started to loose weight as a result of not being able to eat due to the stress and blood loss each month. My iron levels also dropped down to 3. 😲 I was sent for a scan which displayed I had 6 uterus fibroids of which some were imbedded in the cavity, one of the largest was pressing against my bladder which was causing constipation due to the blockage and also causing me to urinate very often, I had constant pelvic pain, my stomach was constantly swollen and my uterus had expanded to the size of someone who was 14 weeks pregnant. I became even more stressed out as I could feel and see that my body wasn’t the same anymore and there was very little I could do to control this. I was closely monitored over last year but my iron and vitamin D level was still worryingly low, my doctor considered a blood transfusion as the medication given was not making a major difference, as you can imagine I didn’t want this. The bleeding became worse as I was bleeding at random and at this point I had bled so much I lost track of what was a period and what wasn’t. Unfortunately I was still being rushed in to hospital due to blood loss, at this point I was really fed up of the whole ordeal. I was placed on Northesterine which is a synthetic drug used to mimic the hormone progesterone which prevents bleeding, this really helped and the bleeding stopped. My doctor offered me the option to have the fibroid tumours removed last year September as we had tried all other options, I felt I had no choice but to have them removed, I went away and did some research into what the best possible procedure would be for me as I wanted to still be able to conceive when I was ready to. I was booked in for a hysteroscopic myomectomy in November 2017 where the surgeon attempted to removed the fibroids via the vagina, unfortunately the procedure was unsuccessful as the tumors were deeply imbedded in the cavities and some were unreachable, a sample was taken from one of them and sent of to the lab for testing and I was given the all clear for cancer December 2017 (thank god). I was no longer able to work and was signed off by my doctor, I was off for a total of 3 months and decided it was best I didn’t return as my role was also extremely stressful and I no longer felt I was able to perform to the best of my ability. I spent most of my time researching different procedures and reading other women’s experiences in forums, after a while I decided to go back to work as i felt like I had become a little depressed with everything that was happening, I found a new job on a part time basis. I explained all that was going on to my manager who was very supportive. After months of research I decided that a Myomectomy seemed like a good option for me as the Myomectomy is a surgery to remove fibroids without taking out the healthy tissue of the uterus. It is best for women who wish to have children after treatment for their fibroids or who wish to keep their uterus for other reasons. I spoke to my doctor to seek his advice and he agreed with the procedure, I also consulted with my surgeon who went through the Myomectomy procedure and explained the risks, The disadvantages of abdominal myomectomy are that due to the invasiveness of the procedure the surgery requires a larger incision, general anesthesia and has risk factors associated with abdominal surgery such as blood loss which could lead to a Hysterectomy, accidental damage to the uterus,  pain and infection, longer recovery although recovery time is generally 2-6 weeks. So as you can imagine there was still a risk of me not being able to conceive even though I had chosen the best possible option for me. I was finally scheduled for an open Myomectomy on the 4th July 2018, I don’t think words can describe the relief I felt after waking up from the operation, the operation took about 2 hours and they successfully removed a total of 9 tumours, luckily I didn’t loose too much blood and the surgeon managed to preserve my uterus. I spent a week in hospital. I am now 6 weeks post op, still feeling sore but the joy of knowing the tumours have been removed is worth the pain, knowing I can conceive if I wanted to and I can hopefully get my life back on track. The first 2-3 weeks of recovery were the worst (sorry to scare anyone) your energy levels are next to nothing and that’s coming from an energetic person, it’s so painful to go to the toilet, no feeling in the bikini line area due to the nerves being cut through during surgery, you basically feel like rubbish. Support is definitely required during this time. After the second week you are encouraged to go for walks to strengthen your body, I could only walk for a maximum of 7-8 mins before feeling like I had just completed a marathon and being forced to return home, I just couldn’t do it but in my mind I felt I was ok to get around judging by the fact that I’m generally very active. I became very emotional as I felt like I was going to permanently be this way, my mind and my body were doing two different things but in this case I had to listen to my body and not my mind. It’s a must that you get plenty of rest, fluids and eat well. Week 4-5 I was able to walk a little further but I still took time and it wasn’t and still isn’t at a pace that I would normally walk, things looked a little more positive during week 5, I felt a litte normal again, all the medications I had been on were out of my system, I had much more of an appetite, I wanted to walk more instead of having to force myself and generally felt like my body was on the mend. I had an appointment with the surgeon last week who went through a few do’s and dont’s, he had a look at my scar, had a feel of the internal tissue from the outside and scanned my stomach to see how I was healing internally, he confirmed it all seemed fine and I seemed to be healing nice and quickly, he did say that the inside will take much longer as its internal. I am still sore as previously mentioned which is normal as there was a lot of chopping done internally due to where my tumors were situated. I am now on week 6 and am stronger than before, walking more (still at a slow pace), eating healthy, doing light house work but still cautious. My advice to anybody going through any Gynecological procedures is to be strong, easy to say but if you don't it will only become hard during your recovery, think positive about the situation, tell yourself everything will be ok, make sure you have some type of support, I chose to go to the hospital alone, I wanted to face this on my own. I knew god would see me through as he always does. It hasn't been an easy journey and I still cry when I talk about it but I know and have faith that things will only get better 💕 Thanks for reading 😙 0 likes, 3 replies "

Uterine Fibroids,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/progestogen-only-contraceptive-pill-pop-what-are-your-experiences--696092,Progestogen-only contraceptive pill (POP) - what are your experiences?,"Hi ladies, I need some advice and hope you can help. Quick summary - have longstanding issue with  , was prescribed Esmya (ulipristal acetate) a year ago ahead of  , which I took for three months, in the meantime, made significant changes to lifestyle and diet and things settled down and became much more manageable, to the point that I cancelled my scheduled hysterectomy. Scan also showed that fibroids had shrunk and my consultant agreed that if they were no longer causing me problems, then I would do well to wait and see. Fast forward 6 months later. I've noticed my monthly bleeding getting heavier and clottier, though unlike before, I am not in any pain, which makes me wonder if it is perimenopausal bleeding (I am 48) rather than related to the fibroids. I have been researching the role of progesterone in balancing out hormonal related bleeding and went to the GP for some advice. She started me on desogestrel (Cerelle), which is a progestogen-only pill. I understand that this can cause irregular bleeding and spotting, similar to the Mirena coil when first fitted, but that eventually bleeding is reduced, to the point where 40% of women become completely amenorrhoeic and their periods cease altogether. I have only been taking Cerelle for six days, but I have just finished the most horrendously heavy period (I started taking the pill on day 1). It was so heavy that today my ears are ringing and I feel breathless and weak and I almost fainted on the train to work yesterday. I know I can't carry on like this, but want to avoid surgery.

Uterine Fibroids,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/rare-parasitic-fibroid-696763,Rare Parasitic Fibroid,"I wanted to share my experience, just in case it could help someone else. I've had a 5 year history of extreme fatigue,  , bloating and back pain. It's built gradually to the point I was no longer functioning. I've been unable to work for 17 months now and lost my job. I was found to have   back in Dec 2015 but was told they were asymptomatic because they were outside my uterus. I have no proof related issues. A Dr queried   and so I had a diagnostic lap in April 2016. Nothing was found, just the fibroids, one of which was now larger and filled my pouch of douglas. Again, I was told they were asymptomatic and I was discharged from gynae with the no medical cause for my problems. 6 months after the lap,  my back pain worsened and I was referred to orthopaedics. It was a 9 month wait so wasn't until April 2018 when I had an mri. After the mri, I was told I had severe endo and was referred to gynae. The endo team requested another mri and   and I was told I had a cyst too. They didn't tell me this but they also found a large mass. They didn't know what the mass was and were querying   or endo. Everything got a bit stuck at this point with no one really taking on my case so I ended up requesting my medical notes,saw all the queries of cancerand  wrote a letter of complaint and was picked up by the endo service. The endo specialist felt surgery was the best option but that they couldn't really tell what was going on so surgery had a lot of questions and a lot of possible outcomes. I was told that to remove the cyst and mass, I'd likely need a full hysterectomy. I was put on decapeptyl in the months running up to the surgery to try shrink it and reduce risk (which has been awful). I am now 9 days post op. I had 2 surgeons- one an endo specialist and another a very experienced gynae who specialises in more complex laparoscopic surgeries. Nothing prepared me for what I was told when I woke up- the mass everyone was so puzzled by was a parasitic fibroid. Apparently, an extremely rare type of fibroid that grows out from the uterus and then grows connections to nearby body parts to absorb blood and nutrients. There are hardly any cases of these but it's usually the result of previous surgery to remove fibroids, which have left a few cells in the pelvis which have become attached to organs and grown- which isn't the case with me. My parasite had become tethered to all of my organs. It was literally sucking the life out of me. They managed to successfully cut it away from my body- apparently it came away fairly easily. The put the fibroid in a bag and masticated it so it could be removed laproscopically without leaving any cells behind to cause further fibroids to grow. The cyst they thought was an endometrioma was not growing from any of my organs as they though but from the fibroid itself- so this was completely removed too. They searched my entire pelvis thoroughly and no endometriosis was found . The endo specialist suspects the fibroid may have endo inside it which would account for the cyst- I'll find out once the pathology report has been done. But they believe I will make a full recovery! It feels a bit like a miracle. My post op experience has not been easy- I've been really unwell and had a few complications, I'm still struggling badly  with anemia that's  developed since surgery. I think recover will be slow. I have been dismissed so many times by GPS and consultants. Many times I was discouraged and give up on getting help medically and would try to feel better through diet or holistic methods but after the mri, I could see it wasn't right and got my medical notes and decided to fight. I'm so glad I did. I hope my story gives people hope and the encouragement to fight- keep asking questions, complaining, learning, demanding. Just don't give up. 0 likes, 4 replies "

Uterine Fibroids,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/large-fibroid-experiments-with-alternative-therapies-unconclusive-697200,Large fibroid - experiments with alternative therapies - unconclusive,"This is extremely long and doesn't actually give any useful reference yet. Hello, I am 40 yo and was diagnosed with a tiny uterin  fibroid when I was 27, however it wasn't till I was 31 that it grew in what seemed a short period of time, to reach the size of 14cm/9cm/9cm .  It was the same fibroid which they had found 5 years before), but it had just grew as one big lump - there are no others in the womb. It is so large that they cannot see where it is attached. It causes no pain. Causes heavy bleeding but herbal medicine and healing are semi-controlling that since a few months. So I wondered what was happening during that drastic period where I lived an idyllic life, when it grew. I was going through a very upsetting and stressful relationship by which I felt trapped - we didn't get on sexually after the initial period , yet I was eating mostly organic food, and lived a very healthy, life in the  deep countryside (so, pollution wasn't a problem). Is it the stress of those few months  relationship that grew it to that size? Or is it due to my childhood?  Or is it that there is family recurrence with fibroids? Or is it both? I will never know. I am very slim, small framed woman (an 8 but 10 with the fibroid)  and this fibroid makes me look 6 months pregnant. My partner is very encouraging and tells me i am beautiful despite Lucy(it's how we called ""her"") and my skin problems ...and it is so lovely to have someone like that . Of course, I do not believe a word he says ( he obviously says it ""by pity"") and I think instead of myself to be ""demodee"", now I have lost my only value in life, my body. Since the fibroid grew so large,  I did my best to try absolutely everything I could try to cure it. Homeopathy. One of the most renowned doctors of the school of homeopathy in York. I followed him for a  good year,  gave me varied things. No effect. He was really really surprised and wanted me to carry on but my wallet and I  lost faith. I went back to my old classical homeopath who has now treated me for 2 years with remedies, this has not really done it (yet) and as it cost a lot and I couldn't take anything else at the same time I had to stop. It perhaps is still working. Herbal treatment. I have followed all the advice on the internet. Eaten a lot of pineapple, (hello,  mouth sores!) unripe papayas, silk-worm extract (serrapeptase: an enzyme to ""eat up the fibroids"" till it started eating up my stomach) then there was a very expensive pill you can buy on the internet from the USA at about £89 for a month worth  of various herbal extract + £££ postage. No obvious 3 month results. I carried on for 6. The pills were repeating on my stomach by the end and l threw them out.  I have also tried boron intake, supplementing with everything I could read that would improve the flow to the pelvis, copper detox (the metal copper is accused of being able to make fibroids grow if too much in the water - In fact, the water was very sour and the pipes copper when it grew– could be coincidence.)  The real herbal treatment I am now following is quite drastic, it involves an intense treatment of herbal tea. The herbal tea is  of Nettle, Dandelion root (untoasted), Cleavers, and Yarrow.  As I also suffer from bad circulation, another few herbs were added like Gingko and hawthorn. I was to drink 5 mugs a day of this tea. I have done that since last August. It is now ...March. 9 months? Not much sign of any change yet other than vaguely more controlled bleeding which is positive. The other minor health problems due to circulation have not improved yet. Nor have all the skin tags and red moles that have appeared with the fibroid.  Also, now I am starting to give the herbal tea up. The taste of the mixed-up yarrow makes me want to vomit. I can't throw it away so started having fresh nettle and cleaver tea instead, but I am growing spots so it can't be good like the old one. Healing. I have done so much emotional healing in private therapy and started touching at all the causes that could trigger such a large, non-malignant  growth, to happen, if such things were created by our thoughts or memories like the new-age books tell us. Childhood rape and incest - yes.  Bullying at school.Yes. Bullying in the family. Yes. There were the odd mental issue too.  But only them knew that. The sex industry is also a culprit for fibroid growth? Yes.  Running away from committing to relationships? Yes.  History of sexual abuse in the family other than your own? Yes.  Giving yourself to sex too easily? Yes. (I thought it was the only way to keep a boyfriend when I was younger- so to show them I would do a good wife. But it never works. I end up falling out with them.) Stress now in your personal life? Well, like all of us. We are all stressed and have anxious thoughts for most of the day, and if they are not anxious thoughts, they are negative, they judge others or ourselves, they tell us that we are  victims, they tell us this person looking at you over there thinks we are very ugly indeed. Or we fear that they want to use us for sex, or beat us up. So, as responsible adults, we work on those old emotions to cleanse them out of us so we can be given another 50 years of graceful and elegant life. We go and see therapists in the hope someone will create a miracle for us. We trust all this will help, us inside and someone outside, as what else is our bodies but a reflection of our minds? Introversion, always. My boyfriend tells me to stop looking inside so much, to look outside. How beautiful a life there is to live. How he doesn't care about my ailments. I tell him I don't want to be outside, it is full of suffering. Suffering is what I see inside, and I certainly don't want to face the worse world outside that is will add more overwhelming suffering to my own which I can't process already. Maybe I have gone mad and there is no fibroid at all and I am just a memory of my life, that I keep reliving the same way, not managing to change its direction because I am asleep. “lt is only by imagining the disease gone that we can manifest it”, say the new age gurus who also die of cancer. Two years ago, I went through a phase of believing in momentum healing (healing in the moment - cost me a lot in therapists to discover what I could ""perhaps"" find in me, still not found it) so I did some spontaneous healing in my head and thought of sexual organs healing and flowing and LIFE in me ... All beautiful light thoughts. I was in the street when it happened.  I felt my belly and could not feel the lump. Pressed, and found no lump.  I had to stop walking to feel my belly that was suddenly so flat! I felt such intense joy! Maybe it was my boyfriend having sent healing too!  But the fibroid came back an hour later. The whole event actually scared me. Before it happened,  I had been doing breathing into my cervix/uterus exercise for a while, which my boyfriend had advised me to do, as well as I should be sending beautiful love to my uterus. (Why the hell should I be sending it love! It is being a pain in the neck!) so I never dared do that again in case I spontaneously healed and it lead to complications. (now you open a can of worms). What would I do without my physical unhappiness to show everyone how unhappy I truly was? What if I was not powerful enough to grow all those conditions anyway and it was nothing about unhappiness? Today, my situation is - there is no change really, the fibroid and I  plod along.  All the plants, the healing, and they had said last year the ultrasound scan gave .93 mm in reduction that the MRI had given previously , and that there was some fluid in the abdomen.  Then, she told me the fibroid was degenerating, according to the MRI scan they had done a year and a half ago. (they hadn't told me that at the time,maybe he didn't want to have to explain what degenerating meant to a foreigner who's not even from his country.). She explained what degenerating meant. She said as long as there wasn't sudden or large amounts of continuuous bleeding, that it didn't smell awful or cause pain, then it was fine to let it be. I was grateful she said that, she was very calming lovely, from another countrily country like me. I am due another ultrasound this year some time. My periods have changed a bit over the year. It takes about 12 h of heavy bleeding, (I mean heavy) then 7-8 days of proper blood, 12 days to see the last trace of blood, then discharges a thick mucus that is pinkish at first and then yellow-ish, then it liquifies at what should be ovulation, then there was nothing till the next periods much. However, last month there was a drastic NEWS. It will probably never happen again, because I am so used to those long, grey, dark bleeding days and thinking I haven't got long to live anyway so why bother. (I know, you don't want to be my friend)  I am used to the "" nothing will ever improve"", whatever new miracle therapy I start with great lucky faith. (anything new always works for at least 3 days. After that, everything returns to normal) However, that month, I did something I had never done in my entire life: spent a whole 2 nights and one day  IN BED*!!! l didn't do anything, except go outside five minutes, and eat some diner in nice company.  I have also been listening a lot to Edgar Tolle's teachings. Being in the moment and all that. Talked a lot about it with another friend and felt good connections. Lots of good hope, I felt like I was improving.  Also, as soon as the periods started, I said to myself , ""As the blood starts, l am going to consciously give myself an easier time, I will be kinder to myself, not work so hard, and take moments to rest, without obnoxious thoughts in the way.  "" (I was being inspired...) So, when the periods arrived, on the spot, (and they were late....)  of course I couldn't rest. I had to drive back home, get all my heavy and bulky stock out of the car, tidy up the messy lounge,then the kitchen, feed the dogs, then forgot I didn't have any food in the fridge.... Despite all that, I still sat down 5 minutes, and told my body: “You see, I listen. I am giving you 5 minutes of sympathy. I am with you and I hear you and your  pain. I am sorry I work so hard, it is to provide us with a roof when we are really old. I love you, but if we don't work hard we will not get to the place where we can relax again, and think about our life, ponder about it looking over the valley and wondering what we could have done differently.  We want our old age to be gentle and restful, as we have not been able to do that in our lives. Please, forgive me"" ... This is what I told my body during its 5 minutes rest. So... this month...my period... was so much shorter that at day 5, it was really tiny, and at day 7, I was able to share love again; of course, the blood came back on day 8 or 9 (normally that had  become the day 11/12) and the same (just about) pattern till the ovulation. However, since those good news, I have really turned mentally. It started with food poisoning which gave me rotten guts for a week. My mind went foul then. All that period of fluffy fairies and niceness lived before... It now felt as if something  had got the darker side out of me. The one that wants to destroy who I is, destroy the chances of this life to be good. You know, the one that the paranoids of this world believe ""lives in their heads"".  Those last few days, has been dark inside. Everything got worse physically and mentally. I cannot see any joy nor light. I fall out with my friends, with my boyfriend. Even with the dogs. And the Boss? a threatening message on my answerphone. I keep wondering, what am I doing to myself. What, is this body still growing that fibroid? Could it not just stop calling for help? I wonder, what is the point to this life. What will I have brought others. How much am I going to suffer in my old age when I will have tennis elbows and no-knees, no strength in my wrists, my back is broken from the hard work, I have no hips, and my teeth have all fallen  out?  And I have Alzeimers as well? Or MS? Or the latest bloody deadly debilitating disease is haunting our bad-news papers and our aged pensioners? What good will that be, to work so hard, to reach that stage and be comfortable - in some nice asyllum? -  Any idiot would see the sense in this. However, parts of me still want to fight back at happiness, to work so hard, make it so big, that I will be dead in 10 years anyway. Not from a fibroid but of a heart attack. Work hard, just keep working hard and then I will get a nice long holiday from existence. (says whatever is our ego) Among that stress, physical and mental, the skin condition came back in a huge wave that had not been seen for a year because of all the (other) herbal therapy I had been doing. Then... that same day, flees bit me twice in 12h. ( l was only too pleased that it was not the sacrum herpes[...]) The sacrum herpes came back, straight and beautiful on the bone, the next day, as by enchantment. Then the cycle changes... as all the physical erupts, I make up with my boyfriend. My neighbour has been extremely pleasant to me. A car that passed me in the lane as I had gone in the hedge for them, wave. A customer tells me a pleasant story, or complimented me on something personal. A car let me pass in the lane  . See, lots of little miracles start happening again. It starts lifting the cr*p off that had just fallen off the sky. Either that or I start noticing the good in my life again. The fibroid? I don't know. Sometimes I like to blame my family. It's their blo**y fibroid (litterrally) Am I to blame for my life? Have I grown a monster of myself?  Is it just showing me that if I keep on like I do, whatever I am doing wrong, Life will punish me like the good religious-grown cult tell me that I will end as anyway? Whatever I choose I will always be suffering? At every moment? To show my love to g*d? The BOOK said to keep myself humble, not ask for help, and die in the ditch. Did that. Well, nearly. It doesn't bring heaven.  Should I be suffering more? Or should I just rob this body and impose my saintly views onto an innocent child?  (and I thought it was my neighbour) . AH, to be happy and allowed to remember that, between the moments of sad that life carries within us, are those intense and long lasting moments of joy and happiness to remember. If anything happens and I find this forum again (anything positive) I will let you know. 0 likes, 8 replies "

Uterine Fibroids,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-had-ufe-7-days-ago-697650,I had UFE 7 days ago,"I figured I’d write about my experience in case it’s useful to someone. I had UFE on 1- 7cm and 1- 9cm fibroid a week ago today. I’m a fairly healthy 36 year old, no kids. The procedure itself was pretty pain free. It lasted about an hour and I was given pain meds via IV so I didn’t feel much until the very end when the light cramping began. About 30 minutes later, however, the cramping became intense. They upped my pain meds but I didn’t feel like they were working. To make matters worse I had to keep my leg straight for 2 hours when all I wanted to do was squirm. Luckily the pain meds did put me out so that helped. The procedure was outpatient unless my pain was unmanageable, in which case I would be admitted to a nearby hospital. I had to fight a bit to not be admitted but I was convinced that I wouldn’t be able to heal as well in a hospital. So they sent me on my way with pain meds. I took the meds as soon as I got home and the pain was intense through the next day. It did get better every day and by the 4th day I was able to stop taking meds. Of course at that point I started feeling the effects of the pain meds on my stomach and I became constipated. They recommended Miralax, which eventually helped. 7 days out, I have a slight dull ache in the thigh where the procedure was done. I also have some terrible intestinal pain I wrote about in a different post. I’m not sure what that’s about. I’ve had very slight discharge since last Monday. My stomach is not as flat as I thought it would be but it’s also not as hard as it was. I’ve lost 3 lbs though that’s probably just from having no appetite. Though this is a minimally invasive procedure, the recovery is no joke. You’ll definitely need someone to take you home and stay with you for the 1st few days. If it hadn’t been for my mom and husband I wouldn’t have made it. I took two weeks from work and at first I felt guilty but now I’m happy I did as I was in no shape to go back today due to my stomach pain.

After my fusion surgery it's gotten way way worse to the point where I feel like my hips are just stuck. It's very hard to walk now because of it. Has anyone experienced this?

In this respect, my bladder is numb! So I have to keep an eye on how much I have drank and the time to get an idea of when to go to the loo. Or I just go when I think about it.  But anyway I have wondered if this numbness could have been caused by the spinal anaesthetic that I had for the operation.  I have asked if it could be because of  something that happened during the actual operation but they doubt it so the next thing is the anaesthetic. Could my nerves be damaged somehow?

Surgery and Anaesthetics,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hemorrhoid-surgery-my-experience-681337, Hemorrhoid surgery my experience ," Hi everyone I am a 49-year-old female that had grade 3 hemorrhoids.  I had the surgery last Wednesday. Just wanted to share my experience with you all. I know you all are very scared from reading other people’s posts, but I’ll be honest it’s not as bad as it sounds.   Day one… Arrived at hospital 730 in the morning went down to preop around 9:00.  Went into surgery about 945. Was in recovery around 11. The nurse asked if I was in any pain. On a scale of 1 to 10 I was about a four.  She gave me a Percocet to feel better. I had some crackers and juice and was  discharged from the hospital around 1145.  Got home and went straight to bed. Slept a couple of hours woke up and had to urinate. I set up the sits there and sat and sat in hot water.  Not too hot. The sitz bath will be your friend for a few days. I changed my dressing took another pain pill ( Oxycodone)  did not have much of an appetite. Had about a half cup of oatmeal. Went to sleep again for a few hours. Whatever you do do not skip your pain pill. If you have to take it every six hours take it 5 1/2.  You do not want to wait until you have pain. So far I’ve been feeling very nauseous not much pain more uncomfortable.  Woke up around 130 in the morning and threw up. Went back to bed.  The first day is the hardest part but as long as you take your meds you will be OK.   Day two… Woke up feeling better had a whole wheat toast with peanut butter. I thought I had to girl but it was only gas. The dressing did come out  and I felt a lot better. Took my pills went back to sleep. Everyone’s in a while I would get a sharp pain down there But nothing I couldn’t handle. I have more of an appetite today which was good. Also make sure you have plenty of fluids. Your diet should be soft foods vegetables fruits oatmeal nothing processed  but nothing I couldn’t handle. I have more of an appetite today which was good. Also make sure you have plenty of fluids. Your diet should be soft foods vegetables fruits now nothing processed. Took a stool softener and magnesium before bed.  The doctor usually tells you to take a stool softener the first night if that doesn’t make you go then add a laxative. Magnesium as a laxative. Slept through most of the night. Just a little uncomfortable.   Day three… Well today’s the day I went.  I know it sounds gross but you will be better off to go to the bathroom in the sitz bath. It relaxes your muscles. As soon as I went which wasn’t all that bad. I was more nervous about it than anything. Just make sure you Breathe don’t hold your breath. I went soft which was a good thing. As soon as I was done I used an unscented wipes and jumped in the shower. Let the water cleanse you.  Try not to use that much soap.  Take a sitz bath whenever you feel uncomfortable. A lot of people had said they sat in the tub with water I personally preferred the sitz bath. No longer than 20 minutes. Also make sure you walk even if you walk back-and-forth you need to move around. Keep the area clean and dry. You will need pads and change them off also make sure you walk even if you walk back-and-forth you need to move around. Keep the area clean and dry. You will need pads and change them often.  Today I only took the  Oxycodone in the morning because one of the side effects is that they constipate you. Once that wore off I took Advil every four hours and I was OK.   Day four...Today I woke up had my breakfast and felt great. The only thing I went to the bathroom five times today. My mistake because I took a stool softener and laxative together and I stocked the Oxsee codi today I woke up had my breakfast and felt great. The only thing I went to the bathroom five times today. My mistake  I stopped the oxycodone and should not have taken the stool softener and laxative together.   I was OK because every time I went it was soft.  No need for pain pill the Advil is helping.  Day five… Well today I feel wonderful!  The only thing is I’m very itchy down there so that’s a good thing because it means it’s healing. Had my breakfast went to the bathroom once did some laundry housework.   My advice to all take the sitz bath whenever you feel you need it even if it’s just for five minutes or 20 minutes it will make you feel better Never skip your pain pills if you need them!  Have plenty of fluids. Eat soft foods and walk. I still can’t sit fully but it’s only been a few days!  0 likes, 0 replies "

But it's small on me and I measured myself and if my measurement is correct I should b a 38I. For one thing is a 36 band bra is just right so a 38 would be too big and I'm too embarrassed to go get measured by a professional. Anyway a year ago I visited my doctor and told her a bout my problem with my boobs being too big for my frame and that it hurts my back, shoulders, leaves marks on shoulders, I'm very depressed and have rashes under breasts, and can't exercise as its so uncomfortable. Also it effects my social life as I hate people staring and making comments. I asked her if I could have surgery on the NHS, she said no that it wasn't available on the NHS anymore ans she prescribed me anti depressants and told me to strengthen my back muscle and go counselling. I knew counselling wouldn't help me as the problem would still be there. A month later I spoke with her on the phone still in tears like I was a month ago an she was still adamant, so I gave up. Now a year on I'm still very depressed and decided to try again so I rang PALS ( patient advice and liaison service) run by NHS, and they said that I stand a good chance as its effecting my mental state and she knew people who have had breast enlargement on NHS.

Then I was taken to the treatment room where I was asked to lie on my left side on a bed which had sides on (to prevent escape ha ha) and the procedure started. Boy oh boy, the pain I experienced was terrible cramping all over my abdomen like I had never experienced before (even child birth wasn't as bad as this). The nurses kept reassuring me and asking me to take deep slow breaths but this did not help and eventually having been unable to cope with it anymore, the doctor agreed to stop but did take two biopsies. However, because it was too painful for me to allow him to go any further, he said he was 20cm short of where he wanted to see. Now heres the question. Why on earth don't they just put the patient under total sedation? This way no pain is caused to them, the doctor can look at the area he needs to see and all in all, every one happy. It seems a waste of time to me to put people through such agony when there is a simple solution. The doctor is unable to perform a full examination because it is too painful for the patient so its not cost effective, its cruel and its a waste of everyones time! 5 likes, 195 replies "

For the last 18 months or so I have been suffering with excessive sweating, but more specifically craniofacial hyperhidrosis.  I've researched on things that I can do to prevent it from happening, but I know that my parents wouldn't allow me to use drugs or botox or surgery to remove my sweat glands. I feel as though I am running out of options.  I don't know if I have anxiety issues as well, which is what my sweating may be linked to, but I am a very anxious person and the slightest thing could set me off into a panick. The strange thing is, as stressed as I might be, I never never sweat in my own home, ONLY at school-or places where I don't feel comfortable (mainly school). This is why I am terrified about going in to school every day, and even when it's a chilly winter day in December, I would step into the classroom and immediately begin to sweat. People laugh, and whisper and talk about me. My own friends are starting to think me weird.  It affects my life so badly, I've had to stop going to orchestra as my hands get so sweaty it's hard to hold my violin.  Please, please, help me. 1 like, 26 replies "

My buttcrack also started sweating more. It's ruining my life, I don't even feel like going out because of this and I resorted to wearing mostly nike shorts or anything dark to mask the sweat stains. I also suffer hypochondria as well. It doesn't help that I live in California. Bare with me as this is a lengthy post but i would appreciate the help. So, around october 22-23 this year, it seems that my tailbone region like the upper part of my buttcrack area has started to feel a burning sensation, I sweat there like crazy especially when I walk my dog outside even though weather is not too humid. I also feel a heat sensation in my buttocks when i walk. I've also noticed that my tailbone area sweats when i go pass out urine. So basically, the tailbone sweat occurs for me when i walk outside and its not too cold, or when i pass out urine. I've looked for people with the same conditions as me but those questions were back from 2009 or 2012. To add to that, I know this may be off topic, but earlier this year I went to the urgent care room to complain about pain in my testicle area, they did a scan on my back area to see any damages but it was normal, at school during early 2018 i suddenly wet myself which miraculously i avoided anyone and i got to change up. After a few months this testicle pain went away so I didn't bother. So could this be related to this tailbone sweat and heat sensation in the buttocks I've been experiencing? Again, sorry for the lengthy post. This new tailbone sweat symptom and excessive sweating has been ruining my life these past few months. Help is greatly appreciated 0 likes, 3 replies "

I wanted to share my story as within the last ten days my HH is now finally under control... It was all about how I controlled my breathing.  Yes the thing we take for granted. The thing we don’t get trained to do. Ive had ETS surgery and own my own Iontophoresis machine...but none of these actually get to the route cause. The ETS surgery stopped the sweating from my forehead and just pushed the problem to another part/parts of my body. The iontophoresis machine was just a pain to use and whilst you use it you feel like a failure. It’s not exactly a pleasurable experience. I also tried special deodrants, sage tea etc etc etc etc…. ive suffered in silence and now I know I can control it im so happy. In my experience what makes it worse is the day when someone notices you are sweating. The start of the condition grabbing hold of you and making you feel insecure. You start avoiding situations you may end up sweating in – parties, business meetings etc…. You then are always in FIGHT or FLIGHT mode…. And its not the place you want to be. Drinking ice cold water trying to calm your body down is again just another “band aid”…. Wearing vests in the summer , using hand dryers in the toilets etc is not helping you eradicate it from your life. I truly believe that HH is curable but you need to get to the route cause. In my experience it was my nervous system that I just didn’t know how to control. This may not be the case for lots of other people but I now feel much better about myself. I used to ask the question – why me? Why do I sweat like this? It makes you angry and hopeless 24/7. Yoga / and making sure you breathe properly has been my saviour.. Im now dry as a bone! I now don't feel helpless or angry I feel like a new man.... There is so much free information out there about breathing and controlling your  . Don’t try and put a band aid on things, get to the route cause and you will also be dry! It might take time for you to adapt the way you breathe but please stick with it. It will help you I’m convinced.  I hope this message can help other people overcome their problem. 5 likes, 11 replies "

Supraventricular Tachycardia,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/new-to-the-svt-world-686387,New to the SVT world,"Hi all, So, I have been having sporadic palpitations/flutter in chest for about 3 years now.  In the beginning it would occur once in a blue moon like I would feel a hard flutter and nothing else.  When they started happening I went to a cardiologist who did a stress test, holter monitor, and echo cardiogram, which found nothing.  As the years went on, they seemed to get worse and about a year an half ago, my heart started racing after these palpitations/flutters.  The racing never lasted long and never went above 130.  After my heart rate came down, I'd usually have to deal with my heart pounding and feeling irregular for a few hours, then it would go back to normal.  I was referred to an EP cardiologist, who suggested an implanted loop recorder, since the holter monitors were not picking up anything do to the sporadic nature of my episodes.  Long story short, after a year and a half at this particular hospital,  no one could tell me exactly what was going on, even though I had recorded episodes.  My episodes seemed to increase in frequency the more I exercised strenuously.  I finally had enough after a particular bout of episodes and decided to get a second opinion from another EP doctor.  I brought my recent recordings with me to the appointment and he took one look at them and told me I have SVT-AVNRT.  I was relieved to finally have an answer but he told me that he suggested an EP study with ablation for treatment as opposed to taking drugs.  I was a little apprehensive about going straight to ablation due to my fears (I've never had any type of invasive surgery before), but with my current job in law enforcement, dealing with the side effects of drugs may not be good.  I decided to think about it while he agreed to do another stress test and echo cardiogram to rule any thing else out.  I haven't been exercising since the last big episode a few months ago but now the episodes have recently started even though I am not exercising.  Yesterday I was have a series of palpitations/flutters throughout the day and woke up at 2am to my heart racing at 165.  It only lasted about 5 minutes and went below 100.   I didn't go to work today because I was afraid of another episode but have still been dealing with the palpitations/flutters on and off today.  So far, it hasn't tripped into a racing heart rate. So, after that long explanation (sorry), I am wondering if ablation is the way to go.  Looking for anyones feed back as to ablation vs. drugs.  I am a 44 year old female in good health.  My family (mother's side) has a history of heart issues, including afib and SVT's but none of them have ever had ablations.

About me: I'm 23 years old and have had SVT for about 6 years. I was able to be officially diagnosed with SVT around 2015/2016 after they finally captured my abnormal heart beat on an ECG. My episodes prior to then were very infrequent and resolved usually after 30-40 minutes. After one particular episode I was administered adenosine and then I was referred to a specialist who performs ablations who looked over my rhythm they captured on ECG and said I have AVNRT. I was scheduled for an ablation in 2016, but they were unable to trigger my abnormal heart rate. However, I'm assuming they also would have been able to further collate evidence of my AVNRT diagnosis through the catheter body imaging? My question for others who have AVNRT or SVT in general - do you get episodes of palpitations, flutters etc in between episodes of your rapid heart beat? I am fortunate to only get a handful of major episodes a year (which are sustained rapid heartbeat between 180-230 bpm) but every few days I'll have a palpitation or something that makes me stop in my tracks. Sometimes these feel a bit painful, and are followed by other palpitations. At times, it might feel like an irregular beat that lasts a few seconds, and previously I have had irregular heart rate that had lasted for hours too. Is this a normal symptom of SVT, particularly AVNRT?  Does anyone else experience this? I get a little anxious about potential complications of such an illness. If not, whats the potential of being misdiagnosed? Thanks! 0 likes, 14 replies "

I've been up and down this forum in the last 48 hours due to a recent diagnosis of SVT. I'm a 22 year old female and I have been dealing with these skipped heartbeats for the last few years. However, the skips and palpitations have been happening much more frequently over 2018 now to the point where I get one almost every day and it can be very disrupting to my life. For a little more background, I have lost 60 pounds over the span of a year and I have about 60 more to lose until I am at a healthy weight for my height and age. I'm 5'6, currently 217 pounds and I eat a vegetarian diet. No caffeine, no alcohol ever. I notice that my main triggers are eating breakfast (doesn't matter what it is, makes my pulse stay in the 110's for about an hour) anxiety, and eating a lot of heavy, greasy food. However, I notice that 70% of my attacks when I feel a very hard flip-flop or skipped beat is totally random and come about for no reason. I went to the ER when I woke up out of my sleep because of one and they told me that I was in regular sinus rhythum the whole 4 hours I was in the hospital. It wasn't until I saw a cardiologist and wore a holter monitor was I told I have SVT. I guess I'm just feeling very nervous because my father died at 52 from a heart attack and I don't want to follow in his footsteps.

Supraventricular Tachycardia,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/recently-diagnosed-with-svt-i-need-your-advice--689716,Recently Diagnosed with SVT - I need your advice!,"Hello, In late September of 2018, I was diagnosed with SVT. If I could receive your advice and experiences, that would be truly appreciated. I am 30 Years old. I am a designer by trade.  I sometimes get health Anxiety.  I do not drink or smoke. I am quite thin, 130 lb, 5'10.  I exercise about  6 days of the week - Body weight Work Outs + Light Cardio. I was always a night owl; I liked staying up late and sleeping in - not the healthiest of life style choices. I was the type of person who is very productive late at night. In college I pulled many ""all-nighters "" with no side effects.   However, about 9 months ago, I started to experience  palpitations and light headedness from sleep deprivation, but the symptoms would only last for minutes, then vanish for the entire day. From then on, I changed my sleeping patterns. In late August I went on an arduous  traveling expedition, which required very little sleep and a lot of physical exertion. The thought of me getting very little sleep triggered some anxiety that I would experience these palpitations, lo and behold,  the palpitation  returned and also hypnagogic jerks when I would try to go to sleep the next day. I decided to go to a Cardiologist  immediately upon my return. I did a sleuth of tests (ECG, 48 Hour Holter, Stress Test, and Echocardiogram). They caught SVT on the holter monitor, it said I experienced 62 episode of SVT in 48 hours. with traces of Sinus Arrhythmia. The highest heart beat was 132 bpm for 14 beats - not that long at all. However, I did NOT feel anything! No rapid heart beat,  no pain, no discomfort, no tightness in chest - Nothing. The Cardiologist prescribed Diltiazem at a low dose, 15 mg. Personally, I stay away from any and all types of medication unless I truly need it. I have rarely taken this medication. After seeing the tests, it has given me slight health anxiety over my heart. I am always checking my heart rate, I get nervous if my RHR is constantly at 90 (vs my typical 67 - 70), which in turn increases the RHR. My Blood Pressure is always low, almost too low; my blood pressure always averages around 98/67  to 105/70 - which ironically prohibits me from taking a calcium channel blocker since my BP is low.  I sometimes get nervous going very distant places or exercising too intensely. I just want my life back. I am being too anxious about this, I know I shouldn't.  I don't want to take anxiety medication,   My Cardiologist briefly explained SVT to me, but she wasn't reassuring - most likely due to the fact that she has other patients that have more severe heart conditions and can't sit down and talk to me for a pro-long period. I am going to have a phone call with my cardiologist next week with the questions below, but I would like to get your advice. * What has been your experience when you first knew you had SVT and Moving Forward? * Did you get or do you get Anxiety when your heart rate increases? If you get anxiety, how have you combated that feeling? How often do you monitor your heart rate? What device do you find best at monitoring your heart rate (FitBit, Garmin) Do you go by feeling or by heart rate when determining if you have an episode. What has been your longest episode. When do you decide to go to the ED. Which valsalva maneuver works best for you? What do you do if you notice that your RHR is more on the high normal spectrum (e.g. 80-90 bpm vs 60 - 70 bpm) What do you do when you're sick,  For example, I had a cold and fever yesterday, my RHR was 90bpm the entire day most likely due to the fever, however, I was quite lethargic that entire day, which concerned me. Have any of you naturally reversed and greatly limited your SVT due to life style changes? If so, what did you change? Do you take medication? If so, how often? Again, I think you all for taking the time to read this. I know there are people out there who have more debilitating conditions and I should call my self lucky that it's not as sever as it could be. 0 likes, 23 replies "

And it was just something I had. Nothing major and I just went with the flow, so to speak. But......last November....it was a biggie. I thought I was on my way to a heart attack. Pounding chest,  , felt ill, was awful. Other half was with me at the time and dialled 999. Rate was 197. Not as much as some have I know, but enough! Paramedics got me in ambulance and tried to get it down. Blowing in a syringe etc. Having a crash team waiting at hospital just scares the s**t out of you. Anyway, the doctors tried to get my heartbeat down naturally, neck movements too, no success. So I had to have the drug. Can't remember what it's called. Thankfully it worked. My loved ones with me watched that monitor, go from nearly 200 to under 90 in an instant. They were happy.......I felt like I'd died lol. I'm so sorry to waffle on but  I've had 2 episodes since then. One was over in 5 minutes thank God, and one last week was 20 minutes. Thankfully both stopped without a hospital visit. But I've been offered no medication for this. Should I? I'm going on holiday soon abroad and I'm concerned if it happens there and I need the hospital. OMG I'm for sorry for going on and on.  0 likes, 7 replies "

Basically you just lay on your right hand side, curl up into a bit of ball (ie knees tucked up and head forwards, fetal position) and then just completely relax, make sure you're horizontal, especially your head and neck.  Don't know why it works, but it seems like for me it does.  Funnily enough lying on my left hand side can sometimes trigger SVT.  Weird eh? I had already tried the 'breath in deeply and hold your breath for 10 seconds' and 'breath out hard through a narrow tube' methods and they didn't help. Anyway, remember it and hopefully it might help someone. Simon. 16 likes, 164 replies "

I bit the bullet and went to a bounce fit exercise class on Monday. during the exercise i kept up and felt okay the entire time (it lasted an hour) however 15minutes after stopping my heart rate went to 136bpm and i felt slighty unwell. this of course caused me to panic. i got home and felt much better however my heart rate stayed between 115-120bpm three hours after i had finished the class and an hour of this was even after i fell asleep (according to my fitbit) i wanted to 111 (non emergency care line) to get advice but decided to go to sleep as im so anxious about it sometimes i get made to feel that this is all in my head. this is the first time i have exercised after ablation and i was worried about it before i went (also had a very stressful day) I went to the doctors yesterday and he is referring me back to the hospital. however i had recently been there and had 48hour ecg and everything was fine they told me the ablation was 100% success and there is no reason i should be having problems and if its my anxiety causing me to feel things that might not actually be there 😕.

I'm on 18f / 6mm ones. Iv heard about some people finding it very successful and some finding it useless. As long as it delays the need for more surgery it's a good thing I suppose and I'm willing to do it, i know it's all down to compliance too. I'm on twice a week for first 4 weeks then once a week from there on.  part of me doubts that's frequent enough as I had a 4mm catheter which had been forced through it when i had an emergency visit when it fully sealed up 3.5 months after my first urethrotomy, and it was taking too long ( had waited nearly 3 hours in agonising pain with close to 2 litres inside by the time it was drained )  to get a theatre sorted for a suprapubic catheter, i had that catheter removed when i was changed to a suprapubic one anyway a 4 weeks later, and the 4mm hole had resealed within 10 days, that's a 2mm contraction from each angle, so if I dilate to 6mm, it could contract enough in 7 days to make it  nearly 4mm and stop the catheter dilating. I have some 16f and 14f caths as back up incase it gets to that but hopefully it won't. So if anyone who is on ISD could give me some advice and personal experience opinions and info it would be helpful, thanks. 1 like, 33 replies "

I’ve struggled with UTI’s frequently for years and years and in the last three/four months it became a constant daily struggle with the symptoms of a UTI- mainly urgency to pee. It becomes a lot worse at night and just constantly have the feeling and use the bathroom every 30minutes to an hour . There was no infection on any of the tests just the symptoms and always a slight stinging and a constant awareness of feeling like I need to wee but in my urethra not from my bladder. Everytime I would exercise or walk a lot it would get worse and as a fitness instructor I love to workout and have to maintain my workouts as it’s my job but I obviously wasn’t able to do so. After a few scans I finally had a cystocopy and urethral dilation five days ago. After the initial soreness I expected to feel some relief but my symptoms are now worse than  before and I feel exactly the same. The doctor said my urethra was very narrow and so they widened it. I had a catheter in for three hours after.  I don’t know what to do! I feel so heart broken because I expected this to be the relief I have been praying for. It also hurts to have sex and whenever I did it was incredibly painful and would almost feel like I had something in there afterwards so I had to stop having sex with my boyfriend. Should I have felt some relief after the dilation? Is this a sign that something is still wrong? I’m at my wits end and don’t know what to  do.  I had a urodynamics test as well as a ultrasound and all normal. When my problems got worse they never retested my blood or did a swab.  Thank you. Bella xx 0 likes, 8 replies "

Now My Concern  -  For the last week or so I have had very odd, either side effects, or simply anxiety issues.  I feel fine when I wake in the morning.  By mid-morning I am having a very hard time focusing my vision.  The best way I can describe it is like when you have drank too much and simply cant lock on to something in order to focus.  At times large words 10 feet in front of me may be hard to read. This will get better and worse throughout the day When I close my eyes there is no noticeable issue. There is anxiety with this for the fact that it is unpleasant, but it does not drive me into a panic, which kind-of makes me think the meds are helping.  I'd just like to know what is causing this, and if I should ride it out or ask the doc to lower my dosages.  Has anyone else had similar issues on any or all of these meds?  Is it at all normal to be taking 60mg Prozac AND 60mg Cymbalta at the same time?  Is this likely just the effect of no longer taking benzos in high dose every day? My thought are that it's either --Post acute withdraw from benzos.  --Medication side effects.  (I never had side effects with Prozac alone) --A new way anxiety is presenting itself in my life!

Stroke and TIA,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/adjusting-to-life-after-tia-639282,Adjusting to life after TIA,"Hello I had a TIA in September 2017. Am a 63 year old woman, with a family history (Dad, uncles, brother) of TIA's and strokes. Although I made a good recovery and have been discharged from hospital clinic, thoughts and possible future concerns are ""getting to me"". I have been prescribed clopidogrel for life. I wake a few times a night (normal for me). My TIA occurred at 4am. Each time I wake now I am scared of stepping on to the floor in case my legs ""give way"" the way they did at TIA. Another condition I have is diverticular disease, a gut concern which results in deeply unpleasant and potentially antisocial flare-ups. The discussion forum on this site is very informative and supportive. I have no children/family. Occasional holidays abroad are no longer something I'm interested in, both because of the added expenses relating to travel insurance, but mainly in case I have health issue while away. I am very happy to continue to holiday in UK. Friends have suggested going away/abroad with them, but I do not wish to leave the UK/NHS, but nor do I want to offend their generosity. As often happens, unless a person has experienced something themselves they probably have difficulty understanding it. Being realistic, I feel I am adjusting to this time of life in a way that is to be expected, but would love to hear from others who have also been through something similar. As best I can, I have told friends that due to above concerns I am happier to stay in UK, but they look at me in such a way that makes me wonder if they think I'm being awkward.

Stroke and TIA,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/did-i-have-a-mini-stroke--654023,Did I have a mini-stroke?,"Last week, I was dealing with a pretty bad headache. For the last few months, I’ve been having headaches more frequently. I have had issues with migraines in the past but nothing too serious. This time, something felt different. I went to work and went through my day as I normally would. But the headache persisted. By the time I got off work, it was entering into migraine territory.  I cam home feeling extremely tired and I was having difficulty thinking and functioning. As I said, I’ve had migraines before , so I figured that’s what I was dealing with. But something just didn’t feel right.  While spending quality time with my wife I had an unbelievable pain around my right temple. I couldn’t breathe or speak and struggled to move my right arm up to my head. For roughly 20 minutes I could barely move or talk. My wife took me to the ER and while I was there I was still having horrible pain in my head. I could barely move my right arm and my right leg couldn’t support my weight. I had no function on the right side of my face. As hard as I tried, I could not open my right eye or the right side of my mouth. I couldn’t answer any of the questions I was asked. It felt like I was having an out of body experience. I didn’t feel like me at all. The hospital never did any tests for a stroke. They treated me for a migraine. I’ve never had a migraine like that before and I’m not sure what I experienced was a migraine. In the days since, I’ve found myself very fatigued and my right arm has been slightly weaker than usual. My hands have had issues with nerves twitching and the right side of my head has been hurting in the same area. I’m 36, so I’m concerned about more potentially worse episodes occurring.

I suspected that I had a TIA or Stroke. For 2 or 3 months no joy with the GP's and when I got to see a Neurologist 3 months later, listening to my symptoms and resulant damage he said he thought I had a stroke/TIA and ordered MRI Scans (some 4 months after episode). The Brain MRI and the MRI Scans of top 2 sections of my spine came back clear. He basically said that he did not know what it was and said if they cannot diagnose my symptoms they will treat them and prescribed PREGABALIN. My symptons are nerve pain, numbness, pins and needles over my right side from the chest down, exactly half of my body (therefore surely neurological). The medication did not ease my right sided pain/numbness so my GP is referring me to the ""Area Neurologist"" whoever that may be, she said he is very thorough.

Whilst I'm happy with the planned effects of reduced heart rate, normalised blood pressure and no TIA episodes for a number of months now, I have noticed my sense of taste has changed. I used to enjoy a hot chili, Scotch Bonnets (100,000 - 325,000 Scovilles) were my regular salad flavouring, Komodo Dragons (1.4million Scovilles) went in my cooking and I had just discovered the Carolina Reaper (1.5million - 2.2million scovilles).  Basically my enjoyment of chillies was around the riot control agent levels of flavour. Since I had my medications increased to the pic n mix special at the top I've found that my level of tolerance for hot spicy food has reduced to the level that I bought some Ainsley Harriot Spiced Goan Chicken cup a soups and they are too hot for me. More worryingly I don't enjoy wine, whether red or white, any more (although I'm forcing a regime of experimentation on myself on that front) and can only drink 1 - 1.5 pints of beer over an evening.

I put this down to leaning on my desk and at work. Otherwise I felt fine. Drove home, shaking my right hand to get the feeling back (must have been leaning on the car door in a funny way.....) Made and ate dinner, still felt fine. Went to put my bowl away and dropped the spoon. For some reason I couldn't pick it up again. Dropped and broke the bowl. Went to throw the bowl away and felt ""odd"".  Wet to speak to my family and found I couldn't speak. That was terrifying. I had everything I wanted to say in my head but my mouth/voice wouldn't work. Dad went into ex-policeman mode and phoned 999. The operator talked him through some simple checks that I realised were the FACT checks for a stroke. Really scared now. My right arm was tingly and floppy. The paramedics arrived and I couldn't feel them putting the cannula into my arm (numb is good sometimes!!). Blue flashing lights and a rapid trip in an ambulance and I was in A&E. Hooked up to a load of machines and given strong aspirin. Admitted to the High Dependency unit. Following day I was told I had experienced a TIA. There was no evidence of a bleed in my brain (luckily). After a week in hospital, they found my left carotid artery was 70% blocked. so the following week I was readmitted to hospital for a carotid endarectomy. Woke up after the surgery with no pain. Again, numbness was my friend. The surgeon told me that when they opened the artery there was a large clot waiting to break off and get stuck somewhere. Luckily I got the operation in time to prevent this. After a week they took the staples out and I felt a little more normal. Now, 2 months after the ""event"" I am back at work. OK, I am working 50% from home as my energy levels are temperamental but I am getting back to normal. I am still scared this will happen again but as they have cleared the artery and put me on a pile of tablets (clopidogrel; Atorvastatin; aspirin; lansoprasole) it is unlikely to recur ( the rhs artery was clear). The only thing I do have to be careful of is that with this amount of anti-platelet medication I bruise like a ripe peach. I look a bit like I am being beaten up. Quite embarrassing for my hubby but if this is the worst I have to face then I can handle it. I have a future to look forward to (thanks to the NHS). L 0 likes, 4 replies "

I have a cardiology appointment on Monday, but my boss asked me to follow up with my doctor to make sure I was okay to wait until Monday.  It was his half day so they had me go to urgent care in case it was retinal problem.  The doc in Urgent Care said he thinks it is TIAs, that I'm having classic signs, plus with everything else going on, and that I am high risk for getting them, since I have a history of DVTs and pulmonary embolisms.   I had been off my blood thinners for two years, due to no insurance.  I earn too much for assistance, but not enough to pay out of pocket with a pre-existing condition.   I asked the urgent care doc if it could just affect my vision, and he said it could, if a small piece of clot broke off and went to the occular veins, that it would block my eyesight until the clot finally moved and then my vision would come back.   So, what can I expect at the cardiologist on Monday?  I know the ER doc that referred me wants me wearing a holter monitor and mentioned that I would need a stress test.  But he didn't know about the visual issues, because I didn't equate them with my heart issues.  Urgent Care doc told me to make sure he checks my carotid artery.  But other than that....any other tests?   0 likes, 3 replies "

I had not just gotten up or anything. I had been looking at an object for a few minutes. Suddenly (and it all happened in about 15-30 seconds) my left leg started side stepping repeatedly, making my stance wider and wider. In those few seconds my brain literally thought ""why is my left leg stepping out to the side without me telling it to?"". Then I realized what was happening. My leg was not moving of its own accord. It was losing it's ability to hold me up and shuffling out as it was collapsing.   I was sinking down into my left side. I think my leg possibly was trying to support me but it was like it was weak and I slumped over the side and was weak for a moment. Like that side couldn't hold me up. I never fully collapsed as after a few seconds I snapped out of it.  I didn't feel like I was going to pass out. It was completely different. There was no darkness closing in around me. I was not fainting. I've had that feeling once as a child. It was not this. It was like I didn't have command over my body for a moment and it was weak. Afterwards I was tired and legs felt heavy for an hour. Later I decided to go into the hospital and get checked. When he gave me normal routine exam, touch his fingers my nose etc I passed perfectly. They ruled out a stroke and the doctor was very adamant that it could be MS and said I would need to get a follow up.   A week later I had an MRI of my spine and neck. Nothing. My two questions are: 1) My neurologist also said **you cannot have a TIA where your leg doens't fully collapse. He said if I had had a TIA, my leg would not have been able to hold me and I would have collapsed to the floor on that side.  Is it possible to not collapse all the way? If felt like I was collapsing slowly, but then I snapped out of it and was able to stand again.  He also said you can't hold a position like that parallel to the floor for a few seconds. I'm just not sure and wanted to see if anyone has had a TIA or stroke and had leg weakness and NOT collapsed.   2) He also implied you shouldn't be able to 'think' while having a stroke. I was able to think ""why is my leg moving without me telling it to"". ANyone else been able to have higher order thought during a stroke? Thanks so much.

The top of my right cheek was twitching too. Within half an hour of taking the Aspirin I went numb down rightside, My arm felt like it had that dead feeling and I had to keep shaking it.

I fell asleep and was woken up by 999 apologising for the delay, I noticed my numbness had worn off alot, and my eye had righted itself, so I cancelled the ambulance and called 111 for advice, was put through to a nurse and after the assessment she said that I needed to get to a and e within the hour.  i am so tired, i just went to bed and then my head started to hurt so have taken two aspirins.  i dont want to drive or spend 3 hrs in a and e to be sent home with no ct scan due to my hemi migraines.

Stroke and TIA,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/tia-blood-clot-something-else--695108,TIA? Blood Clot? Something else?,"Hello. I'm a 66 year old female, diagnosed with CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) three years ago. I'm untreated, on ""watch and wait"", as my only symptoms have been my lymphocytes and white count. About 6 weeks ago, I noticed that I was having difficulty reading; it was hard to concentrate on the words, and it seeme as if the right side of the words were smudged or blurred. This scared me to death, so I looked in the mirror and did all the typical tests for  /TIA. There was no drooping, etc., but the right side of my face appeared blurred in the mirror. My husband took me to the hospital, where I stayed overnight and they did every test possible - CT, MRI, blood work, several neuro workups; nothing at all showed up. The doctor's best guess was that, due to my CLL, the viscosity of my blood might have caused a brief sluggishness and somehow kept blood/oxygen reaching the area of my optic nerve.  He put me on Plavix. My primary doctor sent me to a retina specialist; he found nothing wrong with my retina but believed that the problem was not ""viscosity"" but instead a tiny embolism.  My oncologist agreed, pointing out that   patients can be subject to blood clots, and I've stayed on the Plavix. Last night, I had another brief (a few minutes) similar spell; hard to concentrate on blurry words while reading. I didn't really notice the blurring while looking in the mirror, however. It seems to me that, just before I noticed the reading difficulty, I had a hard time enunciating a few words - again, vey brief. (In retrospect, I think this also happened very briefly the first time, though I attributed it to my fear.) I have a scheduled appointment tomorrow with my primary physician and will ask about this. I have been under pretty high stress this week over separate issues. Has anyone experienced anything like this? I wonder what it means that I'd have  the same odd symptoms (eye, possibly speech) twice. And, the second time, while on Plavix?

My mum had a TIA back in 1999. Her main symptom at the time was complete loss of balance.  MRI/CT? showed it to be a TIA. She was in hospital for almost 3 weeks.  She had hypertension since my birth after pre-epampsia (over 25+ years before this point) While she was there she was assessed as having ""too much blood"" and the decision was made to draw some to see if it would make any difference.  So minus 3 pints of blood over a few days, she was a lot better.  Weak, tired but her balance literally improved as the pints were removed. I cant ask her as she died in 2007 in short due to heart, lung and kidney failure.

I am seeing a psychiatrist which helps but not enough, at least that is what I think. I go to the doctor often for check-ups and nothing to be scared physically. I am going to see a neurologist in April for a brain check up. My question to readers, and eventually to doctors, is why this is happening? Why does my brain goes on scaring me?

Stroke and TIA,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/stroke-story-what-to-expect--691321,Stroke Story - what to expect?,"Hello, I would like to explain the events that occurred about 1 week ago today & hopefully get some insights and comments! My Uncle, who is/was a healthy 59 year old male, woke up the next morning after being the MC of a wedding, after coming out of the shower, he sat down on a chair after feeling light headed before passing out.  He was able to regain consciousness and walk down to an ambulance that was called for him. 12 hours later he was having brain surgery. As some background, he had been complaining of a   that seemed to come and go for the last week, there was a sense this could be worse than your usual headache, but stubbornness and whatever got in the way and a doctors visit never eventuated. From what I could understand from the   director and surgeon, the cause was a burst aneurysm, which was apparently a big one.  Somehow (i dont understand much from else from here) a clot formed.  WHen the aneurysm burst i dont understand either. But apparently when the surgeon when in to remove the blood clot they were unable to because it had hardened.  The clot had obviously formed a few days ago and travelled along until it couldnt go any further. But my uncle was admitted to hospital around 10am on Sunday morning but wasnt operated on until later Sunday night, so I guess my first question comes there, if it was a complete blockage wouldnt that warrant emergency surgery?  Would you be able to assume given surgery was put off til later that they wer able to get medication in there to reduce the blockage? Anyway,  so the surgeon had to improvise i suppose, given they were unable to remove the clot, so they cut off vessels surrounding the clot to force a rupture of the clot and that was successful.  THe blood was stopped here for roughly 5 minutes.  I guess that type of method would be  a last resort as who knows what type of damage and to how much of the brain that would have caused, but thats what needed to be done.   I assume only a neuro surgeon would have the right insights on this point, but if there are any of this forum, I would love to know and understand the medical science and methods behind that. So the surgery finished, in about 3 hours & he occupied the ICU for about 8 days. He was obviously heavily sedated until about day 4 or 5 and by day 6/7 he was opening his eyes and holding hands with family, but no talking and no movemnt at all on theright side. The right side of the brain was affected and the stroke director did comment that speech would be affected, but they were not sure by how much and that they were not sure how much impact there would be to the movement of his right side. The good news is that by day 8 he had been moved to the neuro ward, and out of the ICU. Today was day 9, and he seems to have come to some sense at this point, he recognises family, he has been crying and trying to talk, noises come out and you can see the frustration because he knows what he wants to say but just cant. So for the experts, what does that indicate so far? is this normal? Given that it seems he knows what he wants to say but cant, does he need to learn how to talk again? He understands what has happened and when the nurse writes things on a notepad, for eg. poke out your tongue or hold up your arm, he follows perfectly. It's such a shame that this can happen to a 59 year old, but thats life hey. Would love to see some insights and comments to help me understand a bit more. Thanks 0 likes, 2 replies "

Oddly though, whenever I drink, I sleep less for a few days and feel much more active and social. I have been like this since my first time drinking at 15. I'm a pretty sporadic drinker, sometimes I won't drink for months, i'll drink for a few days straight, then not drink for months all over. This is how I know it isn't alcoholism, except for some reason I seem to be dependent on depressants, the only ones i've tried being alcohol and xanax. They both have the same after-effects, being I feel 110% for a few days after then I bottom back out. I have not ever had any non-prescribed stimulants, so I don't really know how they effect me, but everything seems to be backwards for me. My only idea is that I took Concerta 54 for 2 years in highschool, and I quit cold turkey in the middle of the year, no withdrawal symptoms there either. Oddly enough though, I feel like its effects still linger to this day, 4 years later. I have read that amphetamines have permanent effects on brain chemistry, so that's the only conclusion I can really come to. Could that be why I seem to be dependent on depressants? and why they seem to affect me in the opposite manor that they should?  To be clear, I have no mental issues other than ADD when I was younger, if you want to call that an ""issue"". I never tried a drug or drank prior to being prescribed concerta, and these ""symptoms"", if that's what you want to call them, have no negative impact on my life. I'm simply curious, as nobody i've ever met has shared this same phenomenon(I don't know what else to call it).  0 likes, 3 replies "

Substance Misuse,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/opiate-addiction-urgent-advice-needed-691827,Opiate addiction - Urgent advice needed,"Hi I have been a prescription opiate addict for about 7 years now, relapse after relapse.  I've hidden this all from my wife and have been caught a few times each time I promise to stop but end up relapsing (and hiding it again).  I have acquired these opiates (codeine, tramadol and oxycontin) by lying to my GP about back pain. After the new year I got caught again and my wife basically said stop now or go, we went to the doctors together and I admitted everything (yet again).  My doctor gave me a taper plan and referred me to a addiction center. Its not going well at all.  My wife was very dubious about me going but I said at least I can try, I attended the first meeting and all looked quite promising.  The first thing they do is get you to admit you have a problem,  The second meeting my keyworker stated that he thinks I need to see their specialist doctor and will more than likely need to go on ORT (Opiate replacement therapy) which will probably be Buprenorphine and this will probably last about 6 months as well as normal weekly counselling sessions and weekly drug tests to make sure I am conforming with the plan. I thought this would be a good idea but when I returned home and suggested this to my wife the SHTF.  She basically said no way and that I wasnt going to be going back to my next session. ""you dont need it"" was the response I got.  Basically she thinks I can stop and after 2-3 days everything will be back to normal.  She doesnt understand addiction and hates drugs.  I've explained this to my key worker and he stated to bring her in so he can talk to her.  She wouldnt  go and if she did she wouldnt listen to a word anyway, she so stubborn. I know I have let her down and my kids down but i really now believe this ORT will work for me. So my next session is tomorrow, which I will will see the doctor, and basically cant go, if I do and come back with a script my marriage will be over and ill lose my kids,  if I dont go I fear i will relapse and my marriage will be over and ill lose my kids. I dont know what to do. trent 0 likes, 19 replies "

Ulcerative Colitis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/possible-ibd-thoughts--682794,Possible IBD? Thoughts?,"Hi there, I have a somewhat odd history of GI issues that have been worsening and are now accompanied by persistent low grade fevers, an elevated WBC count for over 2 months, elevated CRP and ESR for 2 months (though only mildly elevated CRP:15-19 and ESR: 31), joint aches, and fatigue. As far as GI symptoms go, I’ve had chronic constipation since childhood. My constipation was eventually managed on a regimen of miralax but as a teen I experienced frequent stomach aches and then developed rectal pain and bleeding. I had a workup at that time and after a colonoscopy I was diagnosed with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome attributed to constipation. I was given mesalamine enemas for 6 weeks and the bleeding and rectal pain resolved. I continued to struggle with constipation into adulthood which I managed by titrating my miralax doses. I had several episodes of rectal bleeding and pain over the years but didn’t follow up with GI. Constipation remained an issue and I started pelvic floor physical therapy for spasmed pelvic muscles which did help the constipation eventually. Last year the bleeding and rectal pain returned and weren’t resolving on their own. I had also lost over 100lbs without making much of an effort at all.  I saw a GI and had a colonoscopy and the diagnosis was solitary rectal ulcer syndrome again. They recommended I increase my miralax and continue with pelvic floor PT. The bleeding and pain continued despite a strict regimen of multiple miralax doses daily to keep my stools soft. In August I had a sudden worsening of pain and was found to have a peri rectal abscess. It was drained under anesthesia and I was treated with 3 days of IV antibiotics. The doctors said sometimes infections like that just happen and didn’t seem concerned. People keep mentioning IBD as a possibility to me but the GI I saw last year didn’t feel that was the issue. I wasn’t having the joint aches, fatigue, and abnormal lab tests at that time but still IBD doesn’t usually present with constipation. Should I push for another workup given the new symptoms?

I opted just for the numbing spray as I don't like needles or the feeling of being sedated and I had no choice but to drive myself home anyway! I was a bit nervous but I thought it couldn't be any worse than giving birth or having wisdom teeth removed!!  First the nurse went through my forms and told me what would happen. I then had to swallow some infacol to settle any gas in the stomach. I then had a spray in the nose to open the nasal passage b - this tasted horrible but was just like a nose spray that you sniff back.  Once in the procedure room they talk through why youve been referred, i then had to lie down while they gave me another nasal nu spray, this one to numb the nose. This tasted vile as it dripped down my throat but was ok after a couple of sniffs. They try to go through the nose with the tube if they can so I  laid on my left side and they tried to put the tube through my nose. As it turned out my nose is too small so they then sprayed my throat a couple of times and put a mouth guard in and went via my throat.  I gagged a few times when they put the tube in which wasn't pleasant at all but this was the worst bit. I can see how some people may panic at this point but the nurse was fantastic and really reassuring. I just focused on my breathing and stared at a poster on the wall the whole time and it was bearable after that. It felt weird when they put air in my stomach and I'd say it feels worse when the tube came out, not painful at all, just weird. The whole thing was 5 mins at most. Afterwards my throat was still numb for about half an hour but I could still talk and went home after a few minutes.  My throat hurt for a few hours afterwards but doesn't really hurt now (6 hours later). It really wasn't as bad as I imagined.  Everyone has to make their own choice. I'm not sure bring sedated would have made much difference to me personally but if you are really really nervous and don't mind being sedated then it might be a good choice for you. But for me  it was ok having just the nose/throat spray.   0 likes, 1 reply "

Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/best-endoscopy-experience--686802,Best endoscopy experience!!!! ,"I had a upper GI endoscopy last week. I think it's VERY important to start this by saying, I had cancelled this procedure over 10 times. My doctor has been trying to push me to get an endoscopy for 3 YEARS. I was TERRIFIED. I have a very severe phobia of vomiting, so the idea of gagging for me was a huge no go. I cried for weeks and weeks at the idea of it. When I finally got too unwell, I agreed to try the endoscopy as I physically had no other choice. On the day, I think I cried for 8 hours straight during the night and this did not stop when I got there. When I arrived, they confirmed I wanted throat spray and sedation. (The doctor I knew was actually doing the procedure so had already prior warned everyone).  They then took me into a room to put the cannula in. This was not painful at all and was over in two seconds. I then sat and spoke to a lovely nurse for half an hour (she helped in calming me down a lot), then they took me into the room. Which just spiked anxieties even more. And then I started to seriously panic. However, the two nurses who were in the room were so reassuring. One held my hand and told me he was more scared than me when he had his done last week, and he kept holding my hand throughout. They asked me to open my mouth and hold my breathe. They then sprayed in the throat spray, this was no where near as bad as everyone described! It tasted like the horrid banana medicine I got as a kid, which was fine. And I could still feel myself swallowing! Strange feeling, but not scary. They then put the mouth guard in and told me to lie on my side. The nurse was still holding my hand as I was still hyperventilating. The doctor told me I would drift off very quickly as she put the sedative in..... Next thing I know, I am sat up drinking a glass of water in a cosy bed in the recovery room. Fifteen minutes later, they told me my results and then I had some toast and a cup of tea and off I went. No throat pain, no nausea and slight chest pain but nothing unbearable. I read SO many horrible reviews beforehand and terrified myself. But I was probably the biggest woos ever and I would go and get it done again tomorrow if I had too! Just make sure you have enough sedation if you are as scared as me. And don't read lots of bad reviews online!!! There are good ones too. 1 like, 2 replies "

Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/gastroscopy-without-sedation-my-experience--620421,Gastroscopy without sedation - my experience.,"I went for my first gastroscopy yesterday and want to share my experience and thoughts if it helps someone else. I asked the nurse for a few statistics: what percentage of people opt for no sedation - answer, about 50%, majority men. I am female, 50, and decided that I would try it without sedation, so that I would know what it was like, and I would be able make a more informed choice if I ever have to have it again. I was as nervous as anyone else, but I fear the idea of conscious sedation more than I fear discomfort. I have read lots of stuff from the hysterical to the comforting and am glad I did it without sedation, to make my own mind up.  I am not judging anyone else here, as I am aware that personal circumstances will affect the experience massively. I can imagine if there is any inflammation or damage to the esophagus that it there may be more discomfort than I experienced.  The throat spray works within a few minutes to make the esophagus, throat and tongue numb. I was worried about this but I needn't have been. I was laid down on my left hand side and the mouthpiece was inserted and secured.  I was told I would feel the scope pass over my tongue and I automatically swallowed as it reached my throat. This bit is very unpleasant as it passes through, but it is momentary. As the scope is pushed down the sensation is uncomfortable, there is a sensation of pressure and movement in the chest. At this point I had my eyes tight shut and wholly concentrated on my breathing to relax. At no point did I gag or feel unable to breathe. I was fine. I felt it in my stomach, moving about – a bit freaky, but most of the issues were with my mind, not my body. Keep breathing through it. Then the camera is withdrawn. As it comes up through the throat this is the first and only wretch but it’s done now. A quick clean up, blood pressure check and I am walking out leaving the patients who went in earlier, recovering from their sedation in their beds. All I have is a bit of a tender gullet – it feels like there is a lump in my throat but that’s it. Honestly, it is not a pleasant experience – but it is easily bearable. The fear is because you know what’s happening. The procedure is uncomfortable, it is not painful and it is very quickly over. If I had to have it again I would do it again with just the throat spray, no sedation. I hope this is helpful to others.  0 likes, 20 replies "

I was finally refered to have an Upper GI. Yesterday I had the upper EGD. Was brought into the preproom, had to put on a gown and nurse placed my IV. Then was moved to the room which looked almost like an OR room (without the big OR lights (Ive had C-sections). I had a mouth piece placed in my mouth so my tounge is tucked and allow for the scope entry.  The Doc read outloud my name, medical vitals, time whereafter the sedatives were given via IV.  (I was given percocet and versed and benadryl - this info was in my aftervisit). I started to feel the sedatives take affect where i was dosing in/out of it - I could still hear the music, I dont remember the insertion, but can hear faint noises in the background. I then remember gagging /dry-heaving and burping throughout the procedure where my eyes would open and see the screen - but was so out of it, it was almost like i was having an out of body expenrience.. It was so awful. I think since they didnt sedate me that much and was in a twilight that i remember this... Was given the images of my endoscopy. The report showed no a normal EGD, so no   was taken from the esophagus, however I was told that biopsies were taken from my stomach to rule out Hpiloi?? ( I find it so wierd that i already had this blood test and came out negative ) When i was experiencing that intense gagging during the procedure and while opening my eyes here and there while doing so, i do also remember seeing a dark cluster of something - which i cant say what that was but left me wondering... and the GI doc didnt mention anything (again, so wierd). Anyhow, was told the procedure went well which i find bothersome, since they did not mention anything about me gagging. The rest of the day, I was really out of it - groggy, mild amnesia (on the ride home, i was dosing in/out and woud have vivid dreams with each dose). When i got home (45 min drive), my back (3"" below my shoulder blades) was hurting so bad as if i strained my back really bad. It hurts so bad that would actually feel like it knocks the breath out of me - and when combined with some abdomial pain, it buckles me over. Today I feel the same, horible sore back (same spot) and it comes in intense waves of pain.. I called and was able to speak to the GI doc and all he said was that my procedure went well, look out for crackly sensation to the touch near chest/neck area, high fever or swelling.  I havnt any of these thank GOD, but this back ache is really scaring me .. He also suggested i have a CT scan if it doesnt go away by Monday (which is scary and i dont want any unnecessary radiation) Lastly, he mentioned it may be skeletal/ muscular when they turned me to my side - but that doesnt make sense since I was placed on my side before the procedure and before i was even sedated. I had also asked him how i did during the procedure and told him that i remember some gaging and he was vauge in his reply and said its commom that gagging occurs during EGD's which again is bothersome to me- since i remember this so clearly.  If anyone out there has had this before or have felt muscular soreness please share your story - i need some reassurance this is simply related to fighting this procedure.

Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/upper-endoscopy-without-sedation-582252,Upper Endoscopy Without Sedation,"Hi all, Just wanted to share my experience of having an endoscopy without sedation yesterday (I'm from the US where sedation is highly pushed on you).  Hopefully, this will allow others to not be afraid! I am a 26 year old male who lives in California.  Relatively healthy, though I'm a bit overweight (6'2 and 219 pounds).  Went to the office with symptoms of severe upper back pain, chest pain, and swallowing pain/troubles - with the thought that maybe I had progessively bad GERD.  Luckily, post procedure, I was found to have probably just had a bout of stress related reflux.  Otherwise, I look perfect with no issues in my esophagus (thank God!).  For now I am waiting a few months for the biopsy of my stomach (potentially have mild gastritis). Now, onto the procedure: I went to the office 30 minutes before my procedure and got my insurance/paperwork squared away.  After waiting 15 minutes, reading this great forum for advice  , I was brought back and changed into a hospital gown. Here in the states, we have GI clinics that can do the procedure as an outpatient visit, VERY cost-effective, but also kinda scary because you walk back realizing you aren't necessarily in a hospital setting if something goes wrong (i.e. I would need to be rushed across the street to the nearest hospital). Once I was changed, I was informed that an IV would need to be inserted, even if I didn't want sedation (which everyone in the office thought I was a lunatic for).  I hate needles, so I would've preferred not doing this, but it is relatively easy for me to handle it if I just don't look. After the IV is inserted you lay down for roughly ten minutes and wait your turn to be wheeled in.  I'm sure this varies depending on where you get the procedure done. After being wheeled in, two nurses introduced themselves and asked me if I had any allergies to sedatives.  I informed them that I really didn't want to be sedated, they obliged, but did say they would sedate me if I couldn't handle the procedure. One of the nurses said she has only had 2 people go through the procedure awake since she's worked there (and she's been there quite some time).  That was a near pants-staining statement  .  Though in her defense she was super sweet and was just trying to joke with me (I think she thought that I was overconfident, when I was quite the opposite - I was just putting on a brave face). I was very fortunate that I got the best doctor that works at the clinic, he has nearly 40 years of GI experience.  He is also the highest rated GI in the county I live in.  Seriously, this man is amazing. With all of the being said, when he came in, I was asked to describe my symptoms. His eyes got really big, so I thought this was more serious than I thought it was.  He said, we'd get to the bottom of it literally, in about 10 minutes. I then told him that I was foregoing sedation and he said that he wouldn't recommend it, but that he will watch me closely.  If my heartbeat got to hight, I vomitted, or starting moving during the procudure, the nurse would instantly sedate me to protect my inner organs. The female nurse then used the throat spray 2 times to really hold back my gag reflex and to make sure both sides were thoroughly covered to keep any pain from cropping up and so that they could get the thing in my throat without me vomiting. Then, the male nurse came over and said I am going to hold you down and keep you from moving.  That got the heart going a bit. Before I knew it the GI DR had the endoscope in hand and started feeding it down my throat.  I swallowed, gagged, and away he went.  I gagged multiple times throughout the procedure, but felt zero pain.  The nurses were super supportive and gave me time updates and let me know where they were and that my insides looked excellent.  Truly, I had the best team there making sure the procedure was going well and that I was OK. They took a few biopsies, which I never felt, and then started feeding the camera back out.  For some reason, this was the worst part.  I started gagging hard and my hear beat started racing.  They got the scope out and I was reminded to think positively and that you made it through the procedure!  The male nurse was so funny, he told me to think of my favorite beach to relax me  Before I knew it, I was sitting up, IV taken out, and I was told the good news. The female nurse came out and shook my hand and told me that I was awfully brave and handled it really well.  She was an absolute sweetheart about the whole thing, and I don't think I could have done the procedure without them. So, in short, about 10 minutes of your time, versus being sedated and losing a whole day.  Plus, you get to know your results sooner and you don't look/feel awful.  Everyone I saw who was sedated seemed so out of it. Glad I could handle it and I hope more folks consider this as a viable option!   0 likes, 24 replies "

Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/worst-endoscopy-experience--696909,Worst endoscopy experience! ,"So, bit of a back story to why i needed an endoscopy. At the end of October I fainted 4 times in one day. After   we realised I had low iron levels and was given iron tablets. At the end of November I began to feel extremely sick. I can tell when I have a virus coming because I get a certain   that makes me extremely tired which usually leads to vomiting and then recovering for about 5 days. However, I did not recover and I have been permanently nauseous since November. It is now March. So I was put in for an endoscopy. I was extremely nervous for my endoscopy as I even gag when I have an x-Ray at the dentist. However, the doctor talked it though with me at my previous appointment telling me that I won’t feel a thing, remember or know what is going on around me if I have sedation. The day before the endoscopy I had a call from the hospital saying that they could move my endoscopy appointment to 12:15 (original appointment at 16:00) so I agreed as I could ‘get it out of the way’ arrived at the hospital, in plenty of time, around 40 minutes before my appointment as parking can be a nightmare!! I was checked in and had my blood pressure taken, and then I had the IV put in my arm.  (I think it’s an IV please correct me if I am wrong!!!) however this took an extremely long time. The nurse couldn’t find my vein for around 15 minutes and when she finally put the needle in, I could see it wasn’t all the way in. But I didn’t think anything of it as these are trained professionals. So I waited about 5 minutes and I was taken into the endoscopy  room. At this point I felt like crying my eyes out because I was so scared. Two nurses were accompanying the doctor and I have to say they were the most unsympathetic people I have ever met. Talking too fast and moving my head up and down without my contest to fit tubes in my nose etc. So about 2 minutes before the test the nurse gave me the throat spray. However she did not spray it in my throat. She sprayed it and the bottom of my gums. The spray did not travel down the throat so only my mouth was numb. The doctor then put the sedation in my IV and nothing happened. I was not relaxed like the doctors had said, I was not falling asleep, I did know what was happening around me and I could feel everything! I am not sure if I just don’t react to sedation or the IV was not fitted properly into a Vein. So I obviously began to gag! A tube was in my throat!! The doctor took the tube out and tried again but again I gagged! You can not control it! So after 2 times he gave up and they wheeled me out. No compassion. Nothing. I now have to have an endoscopy and a   done at the same time under general anaesthetic  which will knock me out! I will prefer this procedure as I won’t be awake but I’m annoyed I had to go through the horrendous endoscopy before it! Has anyone had a similar experience?

I was diagnosed by a urologist who performed a  . Thankfully, he didn't have to go very far inside since it was near the entrance of my shaft. He suggested for me to get a urethrotomy and inject steriods into the area to ensure that it does not re-narrow. I was wondering if has ever had steriod injections to treat their stricture. Based on my research, it seems to increase the success rate of having a urethrotomy drastically. Recurrence is still a possibility but it is much lower. If the operation is needed to be performed again, the success rate actually increases since my steriods would be injected specifically in those areas where the recurrence is present. He informed me, however, that if the stricture does occur after the second operation, he would recommend me to get a urethroplasty. 0 likes, 12 replies "

I know the surgery was done by an expert surgeon with my penis obviously being very small at the young age I had it done, my penis itself appears circumcised, there is scaring around the end of the foreskin, there are scars on the underside on the head of my penis which I can best describe as slits that are emphasised by an erection, like shallow holes, My penis is a good bit smaller than when it is erect, which I've always been conscious of, but its more the scarring side of things that plays a huge part on myself mentally, I am in my early 20s and have not had sex, I am an alright looking guy, was popular at school etc, but was always terrified of anyone seeing it, hence no one has since I was a young child, since another kid commented on it being weird, not a single soul has seen it, because up until that point I hadn't thought anything was different. It has completely shattered my confidence, hence I don't go out of my way to flirt or get with a girl, when I used to drink and go out with friends, because I didn't want things to get to the sex stage (I very much have a sexual desire), worried back at the school days a girl would be like what the hell is this etc, and tell everyone, thinking of all these scenarios in my head and how things would play out.. terrifying to me. I am at a point in my life where, I presume few people my age haven't had sex, I really liked a girl that I worked with for several months, she ended up making the moves (the only reason anything happened) and we got a little close and went on six or so dates before things ended, never got to having sex, but I'd like to think I would of gone for it, I didn't take things not working out well, as I was really happy etc, treating it like my first heartbreak having become very emotionally invested I guess, even though most people would probably just be like it was a few dates etc it was more to me than that.. so since then I've taken a further step back, having not really socialised much since. So regressed even further. A sort of saving grace in my mind has been that my penis is average to above average in size when erect, it does work fully, so sexual intercourse is obviously possible and whatnot, however when my penis is erect the head is actually pointing downloads a bit, so the shaft is straight then the head is down a bit... which I'm presuming is not normal, so yeah.., googling I read about the frenulum perhaps being too short? which can cause this issue, I'm not actually sure if I have a frenulum, around that area is where there are multiple scars, so I'm not too sure what advice there is to get but I am open to hearing anything, I've never talked about my penis to anyone not in real life, or online until now, I know I should see a GP but the thought is absolutely terrifying, but at the off chance I do get the courage too, I assume I should try to make sure to see a male GP? I don't think it matters to me male or female it's still a terrifying prospect but I'm guessing its more an appropriate thing to talk to another man about? Thanks 0 likes, 6 replies "

In November 2018, I was diagnosed with Gonorrhea. The treatment lasted 2 weeks before it went away. One month after the treatment, I got discharge from the penis and I consulted a doctor. He took the samples to the lab to figure whether I had contracted Gonorrhea or   again. Fortunately, the lab results came out negative. He said that the problem I was having would probably be caused by other germs and bacteria and prescribed some   for me. After that, I took the medicines as directed (for 1 week) and the discharge stopped shortly afterwards. Everything was fine until one month later, I had the same problem again. The lab test was the same as the previous one, which was negative. The doctor told me to check if the water or the clothes that I was using to see if they were clean enough. I told him I was pretty sure about this because I was careful when it came to health problems. I took the antibiotics again and the symptoms went away. And now, it is the third time that I’ve had this condition.  I decided to seek for a new doctor at another clinic yesterday, I told her my problem and we agreed to the test one more time just to make sure that it was not caused by STDs. She also said that this might be related to my reproductive system and told me to find another doctor who was specialized in this field if the test came out negative again, which I am quite certain it will be because I do not have any symptoms such as burning sensation when peeing or   in the urethral canal… Is there anyone here who may know what the causes are?

Whenever I urinate, I do sense there are few more drops (up to around 20 mL) that haven't come out yet. Generally, it's not a problem. It's not really uncomfortable. BUT, whenever I am about to have sex with my partner, I need to excuse myself to go to the bathroom because I do not feel I can proceed to ejaculation without shaking out the last drops remaining from my last urination. It wasn't always this way. There was a time when I could just go to the bathroom and then I could have sex a few minutes to a half hour later. But, now I always have to go the bathroom   before sex. Typically, I need spend half a minute shaking out between a few drops and  20 mL of urine. Then, I can proceed. I have seen a urologist. A digital exam of my prostate seemed normal. A rectal sonogram seemed normal. I did a urodynamics test and the lab tech who performed it said I voided everything normally (though I haven't discussed the test with the doctor). The urologist had scheduled me for a cystoscopy but I cancelled that. I have heard how painful and uncomfortable that can be and I'd like to avoid it unless it highly recommended. So, do you think I should proceed with that cystoscopy, even though my urodynamics test was deemed ""normal""??

Urethral Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/urethral-stricture-my-experience-686117,Urethral stricture - my experience,"About a month ago I was due to have an optical urethrotomy, prior to which I visited this site looking to gain an insight into what I could expect. I was very grateful to other people for having taken the time to share their experiences although most of them seemed to be tales of woe. For this reason I decided to tell about my own story which, so far at least, is going well. For some years I have had a poor urine flow which, following examination by my GP was diagnosed as an enlarged prostate. I took the prescribed Tamsulosin which made no difference. As the symptoms gradually deteriorated, I was referred to the Royal Berks Hospital for prostate surgery. The consultant thought that my prostate was not too big after all and decided to use a camera to look at my urethra in order to confirm there was ""nothing else going on"".  Bingo.... a   in the bulbar region of my penis. So I underwent the procedure and was supposed to remain in hospital for at least one night but, due to a lack of beds, was discharged the same day. A catheter had been fitted during surgery and I was given instruction in how to empty it, fit the night bag and to change the bag for a new one. The plan was to return to hospital after a week to have the catheter removed following which, if I could pee properly,  I would have a 50% chance of being a free man. Everything went well, but what I didn't expect was to then have to self dilate for four months before seeing the urologist again for a progress report. That was a shock;  naive of me I suppose. The self dilation was daily for a week, then every other day for a month, then twice weekly for three months, then a follow up with the consultant. I am now nearing the end of the first month and soon will be dilating twice weekly. I can't deny that this process is difficult for me although not painful at all. The hardest thing to deal with is what is going on in your head. It's just not right to have to insert 3/4 of a 40 cm long tube into your bladder via your penis.  However, I've managed so far and although I have to do this again in about an hour and am beginning to worry already, I will continue to manage. The upside is that I can pee normally. I had forgotten what that was like and I'm amazed every time I have to go. Hopefully this will continue and I can lead a more normal life. A huge shout out to the NHS staff at The Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading. They are doing an amazing job under very difficult circumstances and I am extremely grateful. Hopefully this account of my experience is a help to others. I will update as necessary. 0 likes, 12 replies "

IN FACT. I AM NOT REALLY SURE ABOUT THIS BUT I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT."" Months ago I was looking at this Water Fasting thing. Upon further research, I have read that if a person does long term fasting, the body eats up scar tissues. I am not sure if this applies to internal scar tissue especially in the urethral scarring that causes strictures. This is what I found out: ""Improvements to skin and all other organs and tissues can only occur through two processes: autophagy (catabolic) tissue consumption and anabolic tissue building and growth.  These are both normal processes that occur in the body over time: Fasting only accelerates and concentrates the occurrence of these natural processes and will do so in line with your natural potentials."" In connection to this, there is someone here who said that his/her strictures miraculously disappeared:   What I noticed on Jessy's story was that she did some fasting... so I assumed that the miracle was due to fasting. There are more stories about this (not related to urethral strictures) that they testifies their scars disappeared (at least if not totally) Here is my assumption to this: Body eats up and heals scar tissues. Since scarring (scar tissues) causes urethral strictures, therefore, long term fasting could be the cure. Again, I would like to repeat, I am not a doctor. I am not actually recommending that we should do this. I am just posting this so that we could collectively talk about this especially with those who have already tried this. About my background, exactly 1 year ago prior to this post, I hurt my perineum badly, I got erectile dysfunction, uncomfortable urinating, and there are still some sting of pain until now. I can still urinate so far... but not that perfect. I am nervous that I could also end up with strictures in my urethra.

The urethrotomy was a 12 o clock incision, no indwelling catheter left behind to hold it open, no self dilation to prevent recurrence, the urologist felt catheters did more harm than good. I kept a record of my flow rates and made a chart to give to the person at the follow up 12 weeks after, which I had on 31st July, the flow then was an average of 19ml a second, 4 days later it fell straight to 14, then over a week down to 10, then over a couple more weeks down to 7, then a week ago was at 3-4ml a second, then on Thursday afternoon the tipping point came, complete blockage, only 1 droplet every 10 seconds, I rang A local doctors, asked if it was possible to have a catheter fitted there, a doctor rang me back and said I could go visit but they couldn't insert a catheter, and it would of had to of been one which was a couple miles away instead of the one 600m from me as that one had just closed, I said I couldn't make it, she said have a drink and see if a full bladder could provide enough pressure to create a flow, and if I still couldn't go after an hour then to either ring 111, I waited an hour and still couldn't so I rang 111, after 15 minutes of faffing around and no progress in getting help I got to the point I realised it was becoming an emergency, I hung up and rang 999, it took 20 mins for a car to come and access me, i was hiding the pain which was at that point about a 4/10, we went to A n E with no sirens or lights, just followed normal traffic, was taken into a room in A n E and took about 30 mins before a doctor tried to insert a foley but failed as it was a 3.5mm soft rubber one, he went to find a more rigid one, at this point 797ml was scanned in my bladder by a nurse, but after 30 or so mins I was transferred to a ward, where I was questioned and accessed numerous times, they did another scan which was 650, I said ""it was 797 an hour ago"" they then went away, and at this point pain was 6-7/10 but I was still able to hide it.....just.  After another hour the pain was 9/10 and bladder was bulging out my abdoman and I couldn't hide it anymore, I didn't shout or rage but I was getting contractions every 30ish seconds which were one of, if not the most painful thing iv felt, I can empathise for women in pre child birth.  I was in A n E at 6pm, it was 9pm by the time another doctor inserted a catheter, he struggled so much to get it in but it eventually  broke through the stricture ( the peak of pain, I hulked out and shredded my shirt in agony ( sounds ridiculous I know, I didn't mean to do it) which was kind of funny, then it started draining, the relief felt so good, 1.3 litres I had in my bladder, the doctor was quite surprised. i think the reason it took so long is because I mostly hid my pain and they must've thought I was OK at the time which didn't call for an emergency, it was though, all acute retention is an emergency, if my bladder burst I'd of been as good as dead as I have a bleeding disorder and would of bled out internally in a matter of minutes, and even then , and the urine would of caused bodywide sepsis. Iv realise now I should of just put my manners and niceness aside and of been a shouting moaning patient, id of come across as a prick but I would of been taken more seriously and seen to faster. I was kept in overnight, and in the morning a urologist and his team came to see me, he said they should of done a suprapubic catheter for multiple reasons, so they didn't damage the stricture and cause more damage and scarring, and also they'd of been able to do the 3 imaging tests that day ( cystoscopy, retrograde urethrogram, voiding cystourethrogram)  I was discharged with this indwelling catheter on Friday afternoon, i'm currently awaiting a district nurse to come check on me at home today to make sure I'm using the catheter ok. I was only given 3 leg bags and 10 single use night bags so I was thinking maybe the op would be within 10 days of Thursday, I highly doubt they'd be able to get me in that early for a procedure which can take 3-8 hours , they mistakingly forgot the bedside hook attachments and / or stand, so iv had to use a makeshift DIY  attachment.  Currently also awaiting referral letter to either leeds or Sheffield for the operation, but the 3 imaging tests are no doubt about it absolutely necessary before the opso if they try get me straight in for the op I will have to put my foot down, as much as I want this dam tube out, safety first., so I tend to think they will remove this urethral catheter and put a suprapubic one in,  then do the imaging tests, Not sure yet until I getthe letters in the post.  Sorry for the wall of text, but if anyone who has had a urethroplasty could give me some information it wood be much appreciated. A few questions include: 1) how long did the procedure take 2) how long was the recovery, and how long were you bedbound 3) what aftercare did you get 4) how long did you have to keep a catheter in after the op.

After the scope the tip of my penis was very swollen. I'm not sure if this is normal. It lasted for about an hour and then went back to normal. It did not burn to pee and there was no blood. 3 months after the scope I noticed that My urethra wasn't emptying urine fully. This went on for another two months and then I noticed that when I urinated, after I finished it felt like a sting/burn about 1/2 inch down from the tip of my urethra. I now have to milk my urethra to get all of the urine out of it. Strangely my flow has improved. There is no burning when urinating unless I really strain to get the last drops out and then I'll get a searing type pain in that spot. I went through a two week phase where I was getting stabbing pains in that area of my urethra. I also had pins and needles in the tip of my penis. When I sat down it felt like there was something stuck in my uretha and I could feel a type of pressure. I have no pain when I urinate, no pain with ejaculation. Ejaculate force seems ok, though I have to push out semen after I'm done as sometimes there seems to be a fair amount left over in my urethra, yet if I squat it seems to help. Strangely there is none is my perineum, mainly in penile urethra. Here's what I think is strange; after I have ejaculated, if i wait a while I will leak quite a bit of see-through post ejaculate. I always know when this happens because when it goes past that certain point I will get a burn, sharp sting. I know it's happened because As soon as I look at my penis the post ejaculate is there. I think I have a possible narrowing when the gland meets the urethra. I've spoken to others who have strictures and they say they don't have these symptoms. So I don't know what to do. I don't think an RUG would help due to the location. Maybe I will have to have another flexilble scope to check? What do you all think? 0 likes, 17 replies "

Statins and Other Lipid-lowering Medicines,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/very-high-cholesterol-and-pregnant--669895,Very high cholesterol and pregnant :(," I was diagnosed with familial hypocholesterolemia 8 years ago. My cholesterol was at 5.6 until around a year ago when it started creeping up, it is now at just under 12 and I am unable to take statins as I am pregnant (7 months gone). I am incredibly worried both for baby and myself. How long can my body handle such a high cholesterol level without meds? Taking them won’t be an option until I have had the baby.. do I ask to be induced before my date so I can start taking them? Will my baby be at risk whilst I have such high cholesterol? Will I be fine for another two months without meds or can the cholesterol do damage over that time? It’s been at 12 for roughly two months already (that I know of, I requested the bloods be done as I hadn’t had them checked for a year). I am worried for many reasons and worry the added stress isn’t going to do me and baby any good. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.   Report this ❤ 0 0 likes, 2 replies "

I also have gotten cortisone shots in my bursa, which significantly helped my back pain for some time. my main complaint is that along with back pain, i also get a very very weird tingly uncomfortable sensation throughout my back when someone touches it. the weird thing is is that it feels the weirdest when someone uses just a couple fingers. if someone were to hold a finger to my back after a while i would feel a tingling sensation going up my spine that makes me very uncomfortable. the one thing that makes it feel better is if someone were to take their full hand and rub it up my back. I HATE getting massages because of it. As they approach my upper back to the right my body will involuntarily tense up (shoulders will raise and back will be extended). it is the weirdest feeling! it almost feels like my nerves are more exposed than others.

I simply smoke half a cigarette (or less) at a time and after about 4/6 weeks, you will find it easy to stop.  Its similar because you are ingesting a smaller dose of nicotine to combat withdrawal symptoms.  There is a reason why cigarettes are as long as they are - reason being to keep you hooked.  If you don't live in England, you can get prescriptions free in the rest of the UK so you will find it even cheaper, compared to smoking part cigarettes, to get a prescription to help you stop smoking. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Sore Throat,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/strep-throat-confusing-recovery-600784,Strep Throat - Confusing Recovery,"Hello, let me me start off by saying that I am a healthly 24 year old female. I usually never have any serious issues with my health (thankfully) other than the occasional cold & strep throat maybe once every 5 years.  I've been on a long journey of recovery from strep throat I had gotten on June 6th. I have been on four different antibiotics (amoxicillin, amox-clav, z-pack, and keflex) as well as a steroid (methylprednisolone). Currently, I feel as if the strep throat is gone but I am experience a sensation that something is always stuck in my throat. I can still eat just fine but the sensation bothers me a lot. I feel like it gets in the way when I talk. The sensation is in the center of my throat. My throat is also bone dry no matter how much water I drink. Some days it's really sore but the pain is mild to moderate.  It's a month long story, so below are the dates and symtoms I experienced that got me to where I am today: ------ Woke up sick. Instantly knew it was strep throat. Difficulty opening mouth, severe pain especially when swallowing. Took Amoxicillin 500mg. Took 8 dosages. Had episode Friday evening. Stopped Amoxicillin. Wasn’t feeling right due to whatever happened the previous night, but strep throat symptoms were gone. Saw doctor for episode. Preformed a normal checkup. Woke up sick again with strep throat symptoms. Made an appointment with the doctor that day. She did not perform stress test, but prescribed me Amox-Clav 500mg. Not feeling better. Symptoms have gotten worse. Although the pain subsided to moderate, it felt as if there were large pieces of food stuck in the center of my throat. Also, there were red bumps on the very back of my tongue. Called the doctor. Doctor said to stop Amox-Clav and start Azithromycin 250 mg (5-day) same day. Slight improvement on new antibiotics, but still very uncomfortable. Called the doctor back in the morning but didn’t receive a response so I went to CentraCare. CentraCare performs stress test with results testing positive for Strep Pharyngitis. CentraCare doctor told me to take the rest of z-pack and the new antibiotic he prescribes: Cephalexin 500mg. My primary doctor calls at 5:30pm. Gives me a prescription for Methylprednisolone 4 mg (6-day). Finished Z-pack, still taking Cephalexin. Started Methylprednisolone. Feeling better. No more pain at all, but still experiencing the sensation something is stuck in my throat causing a very uncomfortable feeling constantly. At times it felt like my throat was closing up even though I knew it wasn’t.   Last day of Methylprednisolone. Feeling better still. Sensation of something stuck in my throat has not gone away but the “lumps” are smaller. Sometimes sharp pain in tonsil will happen. Visited the doctor for follow up. Told her I was still feeling something in my throat. She said it was not normal after the treatment I went through.  ------ I was able to get an appoinment with the ENT as soon as I could. This was last Thursday. The doctor looked in my mouth and said everything look really good. I asked if this long recovery time was normal. He let out a sort and soft laugh before explaining to me that the keflex seemed to be the antibiotic that helped the most. Since I stopped taking the antibiotic only a week before the ENT appointment, I'm being told I'm still recovering. Other than that information, I didn't get much more. He asked the normal questions and looked at my ears, nose and throat to make sure everything was okay. I wanted him to say more but if he looked at everything and think it's good, what do I do? I trust him considering he's the specialist. Since I'm feeling better than I was a couple weeks ago, he told me to drink lots of water and take a probiotic (which I have been taking since the amox-clav). I am to call in a week if the symtoms get  again. He will then prescribe me another antibiotic. If that doesn't work, then he will test for silent reflux. It's been a week since my appointment. Things have stayed about the same. Last Friday was my best day yet. But over the weekend it got worse again. I am very confused on what is going on because I don't feel like I'm getting back to 100% but at the same time the ENT made me feel as if I shouldn't be there because ""nothing is wrong."" I really do NOT want to take a 5th antibitotic. Especially when I think the strep throat is gone and it could be something else. It's been a rough month, I feel the antibiotics didn't help me much more than they hurt me. I'm blessed that the ENT didnt see anything seriously wrong, but I still feel I didn't get the answer I want due to my symtoms.  If you survived reading my long post (thank you), I just want to hear what your thoughts are on the sitsuation. Have you been through something like this before? Does this sound normal to you? Is this all really part of the recovery process? I've been a little depressed with all of this going on. I'm afriad I won't ever feel normal again. All I want is to continue with my life but this is dragging me down. It's hard for me to concentrate on life, especially work. I am getting married in three months, I would really not like to feel this way on my wedding day.  0 likes, 29 replies "

The pain is there no matter what my actions are.  If I talk, sneeze, blow my nose, yawn Somethings is pricking with sharp needle at edge of my Adams Apple. no swelling in my throat, swollen lymph nodes nor it is tight.  Rarely, I'll have to breathe deeper because of this. There is no swollen area from what I can tell.  So I'm wondering if this has anything to do with thyroid or lymph nodes? Maybe tonsils? Or throat   i dont know.  I'm not very educated about the throat. ALSO, I have NO cold symptoms, whatsoever. I am on anti biotics (amoxcyclin) for a week and ibuprofen 400mg for a week. No let-up from the sharp pinch and dull aching in the left side of the neck. I only have trouble with swallowing saliva when I sneeze, yawn, talk on the phone, burp or yawn.

Eight days ago I had my tonsils removed and, according to the doctor, even though mine were the biggest tonsils that he has ever seen, the surgery went well, quick with no bleeding. Pain during the first two days was manageable, I could eat soft food, drink water and talk. However, starting from day three and onward, pain has gotten incredibly worse. Even though I am taking Pinex Forte (codein and paracetamol) and Voltaren  (both as suppositories) the pain is unbearable. Not only that, but last time I ate was more than 36 hours ago and I can barely sleep 1-2 hours each night/morning.  Two times I woke up dehydrated, with horribly thick white scabs on my tongue and inside the mouth and when I tried to sip a few drops of water, I started bleeding and I had to go to the E.R. They kept me under observation, got IV'ed and sent back home. Even though I told them several times that even under observation pain was unbearable and I did not sleep, they did not seem to listen. Also, pain gets so much worse at night and in the morning that I could not stop from crying for the first time in years. Now I am weak, lost weight, cannot stand on my feet and got cold flashes.

Spinal Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/spondylolisthesis-causing-right-side-lower-back-pain--693513,spondylolisthesis causing right side lower back pain? ,"I have a grade 2 spondy in my L5/S1 that is bordering on grade 3. Over the past few months I've developed pain in my right lower back that is not the nerve pain my surgeon has told me to look out for. It is more like pain from what feels like a joint moving in and out of place. It is not in the spine, but further to the right. Sometimes walking is very uncomfortable and quite painful and I have to put more weight on the left side until this ""joint"" or whatever it is works itself back into place. Anybody else with a spondy have the same issue? I'm just wondering if it is actually resulting from the spondy or if it is a separate issue.

Worst part at the time was muscle spasms that just held on and wouldn't let go. So at the end of week 3 I went back to work.

This pain is getitng progressively worse and I called my rep who told me if its bad see my dr or if really bad go to the ER. I HATE ERs so only if I have exhausted everything under the sun will I go there. I cant get in to see the drs in his office until May 1st. One dr called in a Lidocaine patch for me today but is this something I need to go to the ER for? It stops me dead in my tracks and my pain meds I had before surgery are not touching it.

I had. Programmer not really wanting to spend the time to get it right, few and far sessions that I finally complained to surgeon and the Company.  Got a new programmer.  He tried hard to find the right program and setting, but to no avail.  So for 8 mos. to the day, I made the decision to have it removed. It was not an easy decision.  It never worked from the getgo.  So on 11/2 of this year I had it totally remivedy.  My surgeon said I did everything asked if me by her and the tech but nothing worked,  As she was preparing to meet me in the OR, she was in total agreement with my decision.  She knew of my problems with the original tech, his lack of compassion, concern and a rush to program me and leave. It is out and now dealing with surgical pain again.  I have no regrets with my decision.  I will pursue, with a new PM doctor different injections that were not tried before.  So if anyone is thinking like me, I say go for it. For those whom it works, I say to you Thank God and I couldn’t be happier for you. My journey with the Stimulator is complete and a new journey to find pain management begins.  I am done with surgeries.  No more.  I think 5 is more than sufficient.

I finally met with with the consultant surgeon on 18th March and he informed me that he would be removing my spleen laprascopically but if there were any complications it would change to open surgery (intraoperatively). He also said that he has NEVER REMOVED A SPLEEN LAPRASCOPICALLY BEFORE (although has removed them in emergency trauma situations -open surgery only), but he has done laprascopic surgery in that area of my body!!! He said it is a very rare operation as not many people present with this type of condition. because of this not many surgeons in WALES UK have had any/very little experience of removing spleens lapracopically. He said that because of this he will also have another consultant pancreatic surgeon assisting him. My operation will be in 8-10 weeks and he said that I am not currently in any danger of the anuerysm bursting (how can he say that when they are not predictable!) i did express my concerns about his lack of experience in removing my spleen, he said it was understandable and that is why another surgeon will be assisting (who has not removed a spleen laprascopically before either and is probably there in case they cause damage to my pancreas at the same time!)  i said that the referring consultant had sufpggested that he could do a partial splenectomy, however the surgeon said he could'nt... I asked if that was due to his experience, he said it was because of the risks, complications and lack of success in this area and that online they only show the success stories. Needless to say I am now left feeling highly concerned, anxious about the outcome and quite tearful and fearful! 0 likes, 3 replies "

I too am new to this forum, but would like to ask about anybody's experiences of side effects of Atorvastatin (as oppose to Simvastatin)  I think the latter is mostly prescribed because of it's low cost - the one I am on is rather more \""up-market\"" and I particularly requested to change from Simvastatin, and was \""lucky\"" because it is far more expensive and considered the better drug of the two. However, like so many of your experiences on this forum - I can relate to almost all of them.  I am breathless to the extent where I have to sit on a kitchen stool to carve a joint or dish up a meal I have leg pains, back pains and every other B***** pain! I also suffer with anxiety disorder which the side effects of statins do     nothing for that! Please let me know if any other patients have problems with these ghastly drugs - I have stopped mine now and will tell the Doc when I go next week!  I have missed about a week's worth of pills, but have not yet noticed any difference!  Does anybody know how long it takes for the drug to leave your system? Thanks Winifred 0 likes, 29 replies "

So I decided on monday to go the doctor because the rashes were getting worse.  I was giving a shot and a prescription for Methylprednisolone 4 mg 21 tablets( 6 day doses)  and everything seemed to be working.    I was finally not itching nearly as bad and sleeping much better,   but the relief only lasted for 2 days.  Now im back to being itchy in the same exact spots and the rashes are still there.   I only have one pill left which I'm taking tomorrow morning.    My question is should I go back to the doctor? Could I get another prescription or perhaps another shot?  Or will it clear up before monday?   It just seems like the less pills I'm taking the more my poison ivy is reacting again.   Does the pills and shot have a short lifespan?

Reading the other posts, I realise that I've got away lightly compared to some people.  What I really wanted to ask is if it's normal to have pain in different areas on different days, i.e., sometimes I've got pains in my knees, sometimes my upper legs, sometimes my lower legs and so on?  Its started now to come on in my arms as well.  Do you reckon this is due to the steroid reduction or something else?  I've also heard that the withdrawal symptoms can continue for several months after stopping the   completely?   Anyway, thanks for any ideas x  0 likes, 83 replies "

I can't begin to explain the relief I felt within hours of receiving this medication however, now I'm super worried about the side effects of this medication. I was initially given 2 intravenous shots of 60mg over 2 days then discharged and told to take the same dose of predisnolone orally for a week reducing by 5mg weekly. The following day I was seen in the Rhumatology clinic and advised that this dose was too high and it was reduced to 15mg for a month then 12.5mg for one month and then reducing by 1mg monthy until stop. Knowing nothing about steroids I've spent the last week researching and have discovered they can have really nasty side effects.

It's currently 2:30am (in the UK) and I cannot sleep at all.  It has recently been happening on a daily basis but can go for a few weeks/months before coming back and lasting anywhere from 1 day to weeks. What happens is, I shut my eyes to go to sleep, within a minute or 2 I can feel myself drifting off and just as this is happening I just jump up almost gasping and shocked. I haven't got a clue why. I tend to pay attention to my heart alot at night and it irritates me and keeps me up enough as it is. These jumps can happen from once to 10+ times a night before I even get to sleep. I've read up about 'hypnic jerks' and I don't think it's that as it seems a bit more serious than that. It feels like a sudden sinking feeling, numbness, danger type feeling and my heart almost feels as if its stopped beating for a second.  once I've jumped up it can take me a minute or 2 to calm down. It usually happens when I'm really exhausted which makes things worse because my body is craving the sleep yet still not letting me do it. Anyone have any ideas what could be going on?  I'm only 22 so I doubt it's anything too serious or anything but it's horrible. Thanks everyone. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I think the pain is at my shoulder capsule place, but i am not sure. The pain is not consistent but it happens from time to time. I search on google and they say its  ? I am really scared. Did I tear my bones? Or do I have breast cancer? Or is it from the exercises that I did?  Can someone help me? 0 likes, 1 reply "

Two years ago i felt that's it's time to consult someone about my fears and because I am someone who likes disappearing alot i chose online psychiatrist who diagnosed me with SAD and prescribed me Lustral 50 once daily and buspar 10 . I began taking the drugs he prescribed and reconsulted with him after two weeks that sometimes i feel good and sometimes not.He increased the dose to twice daily keeping buspar .I cant remember how much time it takes but i remember that at some point i felt that i never felt before in my entire life.extremely positive,happy and wanted to share everything with my friends unlike before. At some point out of nowhere i stupidly thought i was cured and stopped taking the drug . Can't recall how much time did i take the drug and when exactly did i stop but i am sure there was no withdrawal symptoms. life goes on and at the beginning of this year i realized that I am wrong again and may be for along time ago actually i recalled bad times since i stopped the drugs . I decided to  go back to 50 mg and buspar i stayed there for a month with no significant side effects and no significant improvement. so six weeks ago i doubled lustral twice daily like before and since then iam suffering from terrible   that made me paralyzed couldn't go to work alot of days and couldn't do anything while being at work. during that 6 weeks i felt some good moments but it never lasts . i know that it's a journey full of mistakes iam still in trouble but i thought to share this with you guys after all the love and support i found in this forum  and waiting your feedback.

On my left hand, there are 2 lines, but they stop before going to the end of my hand, so no single palmar line   There was a discussion some time ago but it is no longer active on this website.

My penis isn't small or maybe it is at 6 inches but i read that people with the syndrome are usually below 4 inches.

How do you get rid of it?","Hi there. I'm a 22 year old male and was diagnosed with klinefelters syndrome last summer. Prior to my diagnosis I spent about 1.5 years online, researching all of my symptoms. Finally I came across XXY syndrome and instantly knew this had to be me, then went to the doctor about it and got diagnosed and got on TRT. But even before I started researching, I was working out to gain a grip on life, to get over  , low self esteem and get rid of my excess fat on my body. Although I made some gains on my arms and overall body posture, I was never able to get rid of the belly fat and man boobs, even after a slow 3 month calorific deficit cut. I quit working out for 2 years. To this day I still have my man boobs and belly fat. Even though I'm on TRT now and working out my body hasn't changed much. And now that it's already febuary I'm starting to stress out about my body situation for the summer. I do not want to spend another summer anxious and ashamed of my man boobs and belly fat. So I'm wondering.. will liposuction and gynomastia help me? And will they stay like that or will it ever come back again? And can I get it paid for? Because lipo  I heard is around $5,000 and Gyno is around $2,000 and that's a big hit if it's coming out of my pocket. Since its  a syndrome maybe I can get it partially covered? Im living in BC, Canada. Any KS guys go through this before?  Anyways... this is a big thing for me. I don't want to pay for it really but if I have to I will. I would do anything just  to not go back to having depression. Ive had it all my life until I started TRT. My life was utterly disappointing..  Thanks. 0 likes, 3 replies "

I had my first break of shingles 2 months ago and the rash appeared above my right eye, cheek and scalp. Reported to the urgent care doctor that I was having ear pain but she failed to examine my ear; as well as my PCP whom I followed up with a couple of days later.  Treated with acyclovir  for 7 days. Initially prescribed the wrong dose by the urgent care doctor (another strike!) but fortunately my opthalmologist caught it.  Rash  and blisters healed within 2 weeks and it took another 2 weeks for the pain and intense itch to resolve. Did not have further ear pain since the shingles diagnosis. I was completely back to normal within a month. Now to why I'm really here.  Lucky me was just diagnosed with zoster oticus aka Ramsay Hunt Syndrome a couple of days ago. Lucky because this is quite rare said Dr. Google. I saw my PCP due to tinnitis, ear pain and muffled hearing. I attributed it from a cold I caught from my daughter. She loves to share with me all the germs she gets from preschool. So all along I thought I had an ear infection of some sort. My doctor saw new fluid filled vesicles in my ear canal and identified it right away. I asked to be prescribed Valtrex for the convenience (less daily dose compared to acyclovir 3 vs. 5) and efficacy. Been on Valtrex for 3 days and experiencing daily tachycardia (heart rate up to 140s). Although I have a history of tachycardia, cardiac work up negative. Normally my palpitations occur 2x month which is  managed with occasional beta blockers. Has anyone else  experienced palpitations on  Valtrex?  Any other zoster oticus sufferers out there?

Almost two weeks ago I started having some very strange symptoms, elevated blood pressure, headaches, digestion issues/ , tingling and so on. This led to extreme   After a week, I went to my doctor, and we were monitoring my heart. I didn't have any shortness of breath, but did have tingling in my neck and arms, so again, I was thinking the worst. After another few days, my symptoms were not getting better. I couldn't exercise, eat properly, work, concentrate or sleep. I was also getting dizzy. Around Wednesday 7/19, a rash started forming at the base of my neck. Felt like   or ingrown hairs or something. I assumed that was just stress or me rubbing my neck so much. Then the rash got worse and was traveling up to the base of my skull. By Friday, I had enough of this. Almost two weeks of this suffering I went back to the urgent care. They did an ekg, they did blood work, and everything appeared to be ok. No infections they could see. Almost as an afterthought, I asked him to look at the rash on my neck. He immediately said it was shingles.  He prescribed Valacyclovir and I started taking immediately. Mentally, I started feeling better, so I went on to try and learn more about this. In the US, this is an ""old person"" disease, so I knew nothing, but learned this can happen at any age. I realized I was definitley experiencing a lot of the same symptoms as so many other. So, I am near the end of day 3 of the treatment. I have felt a bit better, mentally and physically, but I still feel very ""off"". It is hard to explain, but it almost flu like, but no  . I have bouts where I can't concentrate and can't engage in conversation. My bp is back to normal, and my dizziness/ear pain has really calmed down. I had a couple of new blisters show up yesterday, so I wonder if I am still is the ""midst"" of this.  The rash doesn't seem to bother me too much, aside from some soreness on my neck and head. It is everything else that is freaking me out. I feel like I should be ""turning the corner"" and feeling healthy by now. Is it common for the sickness to go on for weeks?  I see others have gone through this. Thank God I work from my home office, or I would have missed two weeks of work.

Shingles,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/sharing-my-experience-recurring-shingles-20440,Sharing my experience - recurring shingles,"I'm a 35 year old female and have had recurring shingles for about 7 years which occurs anything from 3-7 times a year and occasionally back to back. It is always a small cluster of itchy/stinging spots at the base of my spine and thankfully, the only other symptom can be overly sensitive skin down the back of my thighs. It is the only 'illness' that I ever suffer from - I never get colds or other 'bugs' that seem to plague everyone around me. So, the main guidelines about shingles are very general and should not discount anyone who suffers from this if they fall outside the norm for the condition i.e. over 50, poor immune system, you only get it once, spots appear on the sides, chest or face etc. as I don't fit any of these but have had tests and confirmation. My advice to anyone else who suffers from this is - do try to get antiviral medication like aciclovir as it will minimise the frequency of outbreaks, try the coldsore patches from the chemist (Compeed is the brand I use) - they can be costly but keep the area clean and covered to prevent spreading and definitely seem to clear it up more quickly and with less scarring and, finally, try not to touch the area at all outside of treating it. I have become good at recognising the early sysmptoms and the earlier I act on it, the less troublesome it is. I have also made a connection with using sunbeds as a couple of outbreaks have occurred shortly after using one so minimise UV exposure of the area (not usually a problem when it's on your bottom!).

It had started on Friday, and would get worse at times and fade at times. I truly thought it was possibly 5th disease. She also started complaining that same day (friday) about pain in her right arm that felt as though she had a deep bruise, although there was no sign of injury and she had done nothing to hurt her arm. By the time she was seen by her dr yesterday, the rash on her gave had faded to almost completely gone, but the pain in her arm was now radiating to her right upper back and hurt to even be slightly touched. so much so that even light touches make her almost drop to her knees and cause her to tear up in pain. Based on her symptoms, and after examination, her pediatrician stated her feels as though she has zoster sine herpete. She has been vaccinated against chickenpox, but has never actually had chickenpox that I am aware of (she has chronic hives so I suppose it is possible that an episode I thought was a hive break out was in fact a mild case of chickenpox). Today the pain is much more widespread. still isolated to the right side only, from her spine over. Ibuprofen isn't giving her much relief.  She is a former preemie, and has always had a weakened immune system, so missing school is common. As of right now we don't have a definitive diagnosis. Just her pediatrician stating he feels that shingles is what she has. In order for her to be able to get excused from multiple days missed from school for this, I will need a diagnosis or something from the dr stating why she isn't able to attend. is there not a test that can be ran to determine if she does in fact have this?

Shingles,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/please-help-me-doctor-is-dismissive-696278,Please help me - doctor is dismissive,"My nightmare started at the beginning of February this year and continues as I type this.   I will try to give you a brief but thorough description of my (possible) shingles experience, but since I didn’t realize at the time the massive ordeal this would be, I didn’t pay attention to some things that probably would have been helpful: First weekend in February: starts out fine except I notice a few bumps around one of my eyes.  They remind me of pimples/acne but they are on my actual eyelid and the area around my eye. Couple of days later, these areas look a little better, but new ones are popping up.  Again, only around the eye. Second weekend in February:  Pattern continues. One or two will show up, start to heal and a new one or two will take its place.  Never in the same exact spot but consistently around the eye area and nowhere else on my face.  This time, I get one or two near my left eye.  Finally decide I will make an appointment with my doctor office hoping she can give me something to help these bumps. 2/11/19:  First doctor appointment:  I don’t see my regular provider and I am diagnosed with a contact dermatitis of some sort and given a prescription for Triamcinolone and I am told to not wear any makeup around my eyes as that was probably the culprit and would irritate it. At this point I will admit I did not follow the doctor’s orders.  I continued to wear some makeup, but I needed to work and needed to cover up these bumps all over my face!  Plus, I knew I had not used anything new that would have irritated my skin and prior to this I NEVER had any ongoing issues with pimples/acne/rashes etc. I used the cream all week long and it was no better.  The same pattern continued. By Friday I decided to follow the doctor’s advice.  I was home from work with my sick daughter so I decided not to wear any makeup all day and for the rest of the weekend to see if this helped at all.  During this entire time I had been feeling a little stressed at work, but this weekend was the worst of all.  Long story short, my daughter was very sick and by Sunday my pimples/bumps were now a full blown rash all around my right eye. 2/18/19: Second doctor visit. This time I see my regular provider. Doctor looks at my face and says I have Shingles. She hesitates briefly only because she said Shingles never crosses the midline and because I had bumps around both eyes she wasn’t sure. She said the right eye with the definitive rash made her believe it was Shingles so she prescribed Valtrex 3times a day and prednisone 50 mg for 5 days. Literally within hours of taking the first anti-viral my face looks 100 times better and the places around my eye are drying up fast. I continue to take my meds and I work all week but try to not overdo it and definitely not stress. I only have a few places on my face that attempt to pop up during this week.  I would see something in the morning but it would be gone by midday. Sunday, 2/24/19:  I wake up this morning and the right side of my face burns near my eye.  When I look in the mirror I can see four or five places starting to pop up.  This the last day that I will take my anti-virals but I finished my prednisone already.  I had to leave to go out of town for a contract job with the state so I am freaking out about my face but unable to do anything about it.  I guarantee stressing about it didn’t help and by the evening I have a cluster of spots near my right eye and some now on my cheek and traveling down my neck. I apply calamine lotion and buy as many over the counter remedies I can find. Monday, 11/25/19: I call my dr because I am out of town and explain what is happening. I assume I need more anti-virals or something since the bumps are appearing again. At my left eye I have started to get two bumps to add to the circus of bumps all over the right side of my face now. My dr says the reason I broke out again was because she didn’t taper me off of the prednisone so she prescribes me a 14-day taper regimen.  For the two weeks after this I did fairly well, but as my prednisone lowered, I noticed more bumps trying to appear.  Today I took the last of my prednisone (1/2 of a 10 mg pill) and I woke up to 3 fresh blisters at my right eye.  Of course, I could not go to the doctor first thing this morning either because I happened to be subpoenaed for federal jury duty and you can’t miss that. (I swear, I can’t make this up!)  When I was able to leave I called my doctor’s office to see about an appointment.  My regular doctor is out of town and the nurse says she will leave a note for the other doctor (the one I saw first that diagnosed me with contact dermatitis). The nurse calls me back later and says the other doctor said I need to make an appointment with Dermatology. The waiting list for Dermatology is approximately 3 months. WHAT DO I DO??? I plan to call my regular doctor back when she returns and demand an appointment. (It will definitely be earlier than dermatology.) Here is where I need your help/advice: Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.  I just want to cry over all of this. 0 likes, 16 replies "

Shingles,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/confusion-over-symptoms-shingles-696600,Confusion over symptoms - Shingles,"I am 33, male. I noticed these bites/bumps/blisters on the right side of my abdomen on Sunday the 10th (and they haven't changed significantly since). It is now Thursday night. I only noticed them in the afternoon at the gym.... I would think they had not been there long. They are still there. They are not really itchy... most of the day I totally forget I have them. They only itch very slightly a few times here or there, really only if I think about it lol. They are not painful. Thinking about it now, a one moment day or two prior to my noticing them I may have been itchy in that spot for a few minutes, but it's hard to remember as I thought nothing of it. Nothing that stood out. This past summer, I also had this some mystery bump/bites at around the same spot... and nothing since then (so, probably 7 months with nothing that I noticed). I feel fine - no secondary symptoms that I know of. From what I understand shingles would present with at least something other than just the visual marks...? Any ideas about what this could be? I would really appreciate advice. Thanks ever so much! 0 likes, 6 replies "
Shingles,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/shingrix-third-dose-689474,Shingrix THIRD DOSE,"Hello friends. I hope this finds you all doing well this Christmas Eve night.  I have not posted in a while but i have not forgotten any of you or the wonderful support you all gave to me at one of my lowest times. Those of you, who know me, are aware that i took the Shingrix vaccines June and August 2018 and had amazing results after.  I did have to take both vaccine doses, with active shingles, and this caused the side effects to be severe at first but the aftermath made it all worth it. Other than the damage caused to my fifth cranial nerve, from having shingles in my eye so many times over 8 years, that resulted in  , i did get my life back again, after taking the 2-dose vaccine. Unfortunately, things changed thereafter.  The doctors do not know if the physical pain of Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN) caused the shingles to return, or if the shingles returned on their own and are bringing on the TN.  Either scenario, i have had several hospital stays since i last posted here on the site.  Despite the reason unknown, after having both doses of the Shingrix vaccine, the shingles have returned. I hope this does not discourage anyone from taking the Shingrix vaccine because it DOES work for most people.  I still believe this firmly and believe my current condition is NOT the norm for most. Despite CDC recommendation, 5 days ago, i received my 3rd dose of Shingrix vaccine and i DO intend to have the 4th after the normal two-month waiting period between doses.  Like the previous 2 vaccines, i have also taken this latest vaccine with an active case of shingles...not that i had much choice in the matter, as the shingles were not subsiding.  If this does not work, i have prescription to receive AGAIN, the live virus vaccine, Zostavax. Of course, ALL of this is being done under CLOSE doctor supervision. At this point, i can only confirm that this route is not advisable, unless absolutely necessary, because the path is a rough one, but it is survivable.  To my knowledge and my doctor's knowledge, i am the only one that has tried this so far.  To confirm or deny, i hoped i might find the answer here.  I am in a great deal of pain, with shingles appearing in several places on the right side of my body.  Has anyone else repeated the Shingrix vaccine? Merry, have you heard??

Shingles,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/new-shingles-vaccine-shingrix-is-working--659699,"New shingles vaccine ""Shingrix"" IS working!! ","Hello friends. Please let me first say THANK YOU again for every ounce of support I have received from this forum, from ALL of you. I was truly blessed to find you. God bless you all.  Wanted to share with everyone my recent development.  On April 2nd 2018, i took the newly approved shingles vaccine called ""Shingrix"". It is new, so ask for it specifically by name.  It took almost a full two months to see ANY improvement but after 8 YEARS of suffering with reoccurring shingles, this vaccine appears to be working! My case is ongoing but truthfully,  until 3 days ago, i could not have said with any confidence that it truly works. But the improvement i've had these past 3 days, i can NOW say, it DOES work.  For those of you not familiar with it, Shingrix is a two-dose vaccine you take 2-6 months apart. The creators of this new vaccine claim it has a 97% success rate and that's very high for any non-live vaccine.  The CDC recommendation is for age 50 and older but remember this is a recommendation and most pharmacies and clinics WILL adhere to it but call around to the privately owned pharmacies. If your doctor writes you the prescription, many privately owned pharmacies WILL give the shot to you.   Like I said, i took my first dose April 2nd and scheduled to take my next dose this coming Saturday, on June 2nd.  I've had shingles well over 100 times. My husband and i stopped counting around 140.  I was still getting reoccurring shingles, even though i was taking 3000 mg Acyclovir EVERY DAY for a full 5 years and most recently adding an additional 1500 mg Famciclovir. I still got the shingles but the daily antivirals offered me some protection against the nerve damage, PHN.  For the first time in years, i am actually hopeful that this new vaccine will allow me to come off ALL antivirals AND pain meds. Because my shingles is mostly on my face and eye, hospitalization and/or sedation was required just to relieve the pain. When i wasn't sedated, pain meds have been my daily norm.  As i mentioned, it took nearly the full two months to see any improvement but now i've seen great improvement and have had NO pain and NO pain medication in 3 days. Today will be my 4th day and i am STILL in NO pain.  I brushed my hair and put it in a ponytail yesterday. I talked on the phone, without a speaker for the first time in over two years. i've left my home 6 different times in the past 2 days and i've had NO pain medication and NO pain anywhere. Keep in mind, this new vaccine ""Shingrix"" was just approved and released by CDC this past January 2018, so ask for it by name. Most doctors and pharmacies have little information on it. They all know about it but it is THAT new. The CDC has posted their research, testing and results online, for public view.   I will keep you posted. God bless us ALL.  ~Rhonda 5 likes, 41 replies "

Shingles,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/shingles-without-the-rash-62398,Shingles without the rash,"For about two weeks I was experiencing pain on my right side, around my rib area to under my breast bone. It was an odd pain, nothing like I've had before, it felt as though someone punched me really hard. I thought it was just a muscle strain from so much coughing as I had  , but the pain didn't go away when the   did, the pain got worse, and it was constant and would not respond to over the counter pain meds. It got to the point I was crying from the pain. All I can describe it as if someone beat the s**t out of me and left me there, or a car ran over my side. I had no burning, no tingling, no rash. It is a scary pain. Nonetheless I was still diagnosed with shingles, and given anti virals and pain meds. Within a week I felt a lot better, now the pain is mostly gone, thank God. Shingles also makes you feel lightheaded, faint, weak, unwell in yourself, not right. Before I got the pain I had a few days of feeling really weak and not right and thought I was going to pass out. Funny that as I remember a day before I got Chicken Pox, years ago, I felt really off. Terrible thing to get. Now fearing getting it again so will look into a vaccine. Just wanted to post this in case there are any of you who are wondering if its possible to have shingles without the rash. Yes, it is. Not common, but possible. It is also possible for the band of pain to shift, rather than just stay in one place. In my case my pain started on my right side, then went to my left side, same area of my rib/breastbone. Hope this helps some people - if this is you, go to your doctor, the anti virals really work fast and the pain meds make it bearable. Paracetamol is not enough for this. Neither is co-codamol. You need either a med that dulls the nerve endings, or an opiate 9 likes, 280 replies "

Shoulder Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/5-shoulder-surgery-690881,5 Shoulder surgery,"The first two surgeries were about 12 and 5 years ago. Those two were “just” Arthroscopic to clean out Arthritis and spurs. Two years ago was Total Shoulder Replacement. Went great for about 8 months, then a lot of pain. Turned out the prosthesis had broken. So a year ago I had a revision TSR. I have total range of motion (at least upwards), but always had a lot of trouble in therapy with pain just below the front of my shoulder. I had just about resigned myself to the pain, but then my shoulder started dislocating (popping out of joint). Sometimes when I shut a door or some such motion, usually reaching behind me. Extreme pain, but it only lasted about 20 seconds, although excruciating. Then it would be a lot more painful for the next day or two. It was only when it happened when I was doing simple things, like hugging someone or putting on a coat did I realize how serious it probably was. My doctor finally did a high powered Ultrasound and did some tests on me to tell me that my Supscapularis was severely ripped. (It is the largest muscle of the rotator cuffs). Surgery is the only cure. He is going to try to put it back together with cadaver tissue since mine is too destroyed. When he looks at it during surgery, he may decide to do a Reverse Shoulder Replacement if he feels the Rotator Cuff surgery won’t work. He is going to have a prosthesis there to use to be safe.

Did a whole stack of injuries including tearing my liver in 2 places and nearly died from the internal bleeding. They told me at the time I had no injury to my right shoulder, turns out I had massive full thickness cuff tears to both infraspinatus and supraspinatus tendons and also a 40% tear to long head biceps. After having to go to private physio who diagnosed the problem I had an operation 7 months later to repair the tendons. The operation was successful but my biceps tendon was subluxed and so the surgeon cut my long head biceps! After 6 months of infrequent physio I went to the gym maybe being over confident but wanting to push things along as I felt I hadn't regained basic function. Tore it again doing in hind sight stupid exercise assisted dips. I think I caused the re-tear due to causing impingement of the supraspinatus tendon while performing pressing movements. I campaigned for 6 months to get a surgeon to do a revision operation, when starting the SCR he felt I had bone changes and so abandoned the operation. I can't believe that this is it and I have to continue in pain for the rest off my life. They say no one in the world can fix me.

When it would start hurting, I would stop working out for awhile, then start back. I finally decided to go to the doctor about it in February. He ordered an MRI, which showed a labral tear and tendonitis in the shoulder. I was referred to an ortho surgeon, and am waiting to get a call from them.  I have googled this, and have found many different treatment types. Has anyone experienced a torn labral? I read where surgery isn't always needed. I know it is a case-by-case situation, but I am just curious about what others like me have experienced. I am very healthy and love working out, which has been limited over the last 6 months. Not working out hasn't shown any improvements, and my arm has been constantly popping if I move it, and has a very dull pain almost daily. 0 likes, 2 replies "

When I returned back to original position felt a tearing sensation deep inside the shoulder around the front shoulder/upper pec area but minimal pain.

Needless to say I'm always worried about pain management. But my ortho Dr is amazing, and I trust he'll take care of me.

Shoulder Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/has-anyone-had-superior-capsule-reconstruction--697728,Has anyone had superior capsule reconstruction?,"Hi all! Long time lurker, first time poster. I've had just about everything in my arms done at the point; right shoulder decompression (2006), bilateral carpal tunnel and ulnar nerve release (2016), and most recently left shoulder decompression, calcium removal, and rotator cuff repair (Jan 2019). 6 weeks after this last surgery the RC repair failed. Now I'm scheduled for superior capsule reconstruction in 2 weeks. For those who don't know that is where they go back in and do another full repair, then place a donor skin graft over the repair that will eventually fuse with the tendons to give the repair an added layer of protection and better chance at healing. Everything I've read online says nothing but good things about this procedure. I'm just curious if anyone has experienced it personally. The recovery for my last repair was so easy. I had some improvement in pain almost immediately. ROM seemed to be getting better very quickly as well. But that was actually to my detriment. I was out of my sling too soon, and using that joint too much. That's how I ended up tearing the repair. All it took was the tiniest movement, then ""POP!"" excruciating pain and my shoulder was worse than it had been before surgery. I have a lot of cervical issues, as well as chronic migraines. So the sling is not a friend of mine. My neck can't support the entire weight of my arm for long before I start getting spasms and severe pain in my neck and/or head. But I realize I HAVE to keep my shoulder immobile for 6 week, at the very least, if I want things to work this time around. So any tips on how to deal with sling pain is greatly appreciated as well. I've already ordered a sheepskin sleeve for the strap on my sling. But I think the only real answer to avoiding   and migraines is to avoid letting that arm hang too long each day.

I was also told that there would be no need to inform future partners (im currently single) about the diagnosis because the virus is so common that the chances are they have already been in contact with it. I guess what I'd just really like to know is if any of you have positive success stories from warts and if they ever returned?

My sinuses dried out and it felt like my lungs had some dry dust or something in them, felt heavy and the back of my nose and throat felt swollen and extremely dry. It brought on panic and I couldn't breathe from my nose, but it felt uncomfortable and irritating to breathe through my mouth too- felt like I wasnt getting enough oxygen. (I was tested for   and didn't have it).  This then turned into a sinus infection. I'd have pressure,  ,  , tightening of my nostrils and drying...they only thing that helped would be to keep moving going on brisk walks probably to dissipate the nervousness, but it felt worse sitting down. My chest would feel heavy- there was no congestion, just dry constriction. Now, it's been 6 months and I've been on flonase, all sorts of meds which don't help, and I still have dry sinuses which flair up around 6pm for some reason. I stopped all the meds which created more dryness, and now I use saline sprays, the neti pot sometimes, but they seem to superficially resolve the problem. I've been tested for   and nothing resulted- had a  , no sinus infections- maybe too ""clean' of a nose, suspected to cause dryness. I've stopped all the rinsing and let it alone, just using a saline spray. It's the back of my sinuses that swell, and there is a swollen or uncomfortable stretched irritating pain around where I swallow- this all gets brought on mostly together. My sinuses feel like they were scoured with sand paper and dry. Sometimes my tongue and eyes will get dry and it's scary there is no moisture. I Drink a lot of water and tea. What is this? I am a jeweler and thought maybe this had to do with fumes or toxin build up....I have been avoiding fumes and metal work for about 3 weeks and still have issues. I've gone on an anti inflammatory diet- no sugar, alcohol, gluten or dairy, bought a humidifier, used xylitol, aloe for humidifying, which help, I just don't understand the root of the problem and why my sinuses are So sensitive and inflammatory and dry!It's scary and it feels permanent- what could have happened?

Sinusitis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/question-about-nasal-antral-window-surgery-692555,Question about Nasal Antral Window Surgery,"So a couple months ago I had an awful pain in the area my right maxillary sinus.  I had a major jaw surgery back in high school so I thought it might be related to that.  Long story short, it ended up being that I have a possible fungal ball or large polyp in that sinus.  Fast forward a couple months later and I've got to have surgery.  They're saying that it's going to be a non-invasive Nasal Antral Window.  He says the top of my sinus up around where my nasal cavity comes in looks closed off.  He said this will not involve any packing of gauze and I should be off work more than a day or two.  Or so he told the surgical scheduler and she told me.  I've got my appointment scheduled for this Friday and I can't get ahold of the scheduler (I've tried her repeatedly, she's horrible to get ahold of).  But of course I Googled this procedure (I know I know... bad idea)... and I'm seeing that a Nasal Antral Window is 'typically' where they make an incision in your gums and go through that way.  Which looks extremely painful to me and like there would be a lot of recovery time involved as it looks fairly invasive.  Is this always how a Nasal Antral Window is done?  Because from how I understood it they were going up the nose, widening the opening and clearing out the sinus cavity.  Please advise.

Once I had my son, all of Sjogren's symptoms went away.  I nearly forgot I even had a disease.  Well, knock, knock, it's back!  My rheumatologist looked at my echocardiogram and told me to go back and get another and sent me to a new cardiologist.  This cardoligist looked at my holten monitor results and said I have supraventricular tachycardia and should get my sinus nodes mapped and get an ablation.  So I googled svt's and sjogren's and apparently it's not so uncommon amongst Sjogren's patients. Apparently 40-something% of svt patients have sjogren's.  Is this an autonomic neuropathy?  Does this mean I have to start methotrexate now?  Before I commit to an ablation or black label drugs, please tell me your experience. 0 likes, 3 replies "

I finally saw the relation of burning mouth syndrome with estrogen levels.  I also have facial neuropathy. however, postmenopausal women are at greater risk of developing this condition because an hormonal imbalance is known to be one of the causes. Estrogen plays an important role in the formation of saliva, therefore, once estrogen levels decrease, as occurs during the menopause, this can cause a burning mouth.Apr 24, 2017 Can the menopause cause burning mouth syndrome? — Yours 1 like, 2 replies "

I have Cystic Fibrosis as well though which can cause a lot of the symptoms (such as cough, dehydration, etc.). But the one thing that has REALLY bugged me is chronic parotitis. It doesn't look as severe as the images I find on google--but I have two large, swollen ""balls"" under my jaw, basically on either side of my trachea. A bit larger than the diameter of a quarter. I know it's not cancer or anything--I was diagnosed via ultrasound accidentally, when a radiologist was looking for signs of possible thyroid cancer (fortunately there was none). But these have come and gone for the past few years. For the past year or so, however, they've been constantly enlarged. You can't really tell if I have my chin tipped down, but as soon as I lift my chin up, you can see what looks like two swollen balls protruding from my neck. Is this a common thing?

I was sent for a biopsy to see if I might have seronegative Sjogrens, and a parotid biopsy was done. My surgeon remarked that I had unusually small parotid glands. Seven weeks of waiting and I got the results yesterday. I was told by the secretary that there had been a problem with the sample, that there was very little salivary gland tissue and too much fatty tissue, but that they had preformed some test and biopsied a lymph node and it was negative so I had nothing to worry about. The results will be sent back to my rheumatologist and I am seeing them on Monday for a follow-up. Am I right to be slightly iffy about these results? If it had been an outright ""it came back negative"" then I would just accept it, but it almost seemed like they were qualifying it by saying the sample wasn't great. I wonder if I should raise this with my rheumatologist? I am wary of alienating her by looking like ""one of those patients."" I also read about parotid gland tissue being replaced by fatty tissue in some instances of SS and how long-term SS can cause the gland to atrophy. I am not a medical expert so I don't know if this would have been clear from the sample if this was what was happening to my tissue but I do wonder if there might be a connection between all of these things...

I first went to a doctor for chronic joint pain when I was around 17 years old, after begging my mother to take me to get help. (I did not grow up in a healthy home environment.) Fear from my mother being present in the examination room left me unable to articulate my symptoms and the doctor dismissed my symptoms as a result of me being fat. (Not kidding.)  Escaping my childhood house of horrors kept me pretty broke throughout my 20s, so I was unable to get any kind of regular medical care. The symptoms of fatigue and joint pain stuck around throughout everything. I started to develop severe dental problems and was accused of doing drugs by several dentists and a couple recommended dentures. An eye doctor noticed I had eye damage which I attributed to working outdoors. Fast forward a decade or so. Last year I was admitted to the ER with a corneal laceration do to severe dry eyes and I have been using eye drops 2-3 times daily ever since. I wake up every morning practically unable to speak my mouth is so dry. I experience difficulty swallowing at times,  I have had over $10,000 of dental work done, have regular migraines, extremely dry skin, and still experience severe fatigue and pain. However the good news is I devoted the last decade to losing weight, getting financially stable and getting some kick-butt health insurance.  I am now in a position to purse a diagnosis. Question is, do I want too? Is it worth it? My childhood and early life experience has not given me warm fuzzy feelings toward the medical establishment in general. I'm managing the symptoms as I have for decades and will continue to manage them after a diagnosis is made, the diagnosis will essentially change nothing. I'm concerned that the doctor's won't take me seriously, again. Plus people tell me now I could not possibly have accomplished what I have while still dealing with the symptoms I deal with on a regular basis. I really don't want to have to beg to be taken seriously, I would rather just keep on going like I have been. The problem is will the lack of a diagnosis harm me later in life. I don't want to wake up in some hospital on down the road with people saying if we had only known.... Does anyone have any thoughts? 0 likes, 16 replies "

To give some more perspective before I explain my issue, for years I have had Asthma, Sleep Apnea, Schizoaffective Disorder, but hadn't really started treating my Asthma and Sleep Apnea until last year, when I had tests done to check for them. Thankfully my Schizoaffective Disorder has never been bad enough to really need medication. Last year, I had a lot of depression, but have been learning how to try to deal with that. I didn't used to have a lot of depression, but last year was difficult with having to let go of a cat that I raised for six months and put down an old cat. The first cat was still alive, but we had to find it a home, and putting down the old cat was really hard for me because I have a huge soft spot for cats. Anyway, I've had a hard time waking up earlier during the winter where I currently live becuase of how cold it gets, but last year I found out I have Foliculitus(I don't know if I spelt that correctly), and have been taking Doxycycline as a temporary fix until I am able to move closer to a Dermatologist. Unfortunately without this medication, I am very itchy most of the time, but when I do take it, I have an even harder time waking up, no matter what day or season it is. When it's not winter, I have a hard time waking up any earlier than noon, and when it's winter, I have a hard time waking up earlier than 3:30pm. I have tried going to bed earlier, but when I do that, I just end up getting more sleep and still can't wake up earlier. Now, the biggest problem when it comes to my sleeping that I have noticed lately is when I have dreams. This normally wouldn't be a problem, but I have been living out in a small town that I call ""the middle of nowhere"" for almost 2 and a half years now. I have a hard time making friends with any of the locals, because almost no one near my age lives in this town, and I grew up in a much more populated area, so I'm not used to being so isolated and having such limited options when it comes to socializing. Also, the nearest town where I buy groceries is 45 miles away, which is a chore to drive to and back each time, so trying to socialize there isn't affordable because it takes so much gas just to get groceries. Basically, to put it shortly, I have nothing going for me in this town. My wife and I only moved here because the doctors were terrible where we used to live, but long term they aren't much better here. We do have plans to move sometimes this year, but even before we moved here I felt isolated for the past 4.5 years. And to get to my problem, I have been having dreams where I am hanging out with old friends, in towns that I used to live in, hundreds of miles of where I live now. When I wake up, I feel like my dreams are torturing me, even taunting me, as if they are saying ""You had this once, and you're probably never going to have it that good again. Haha. You'll just be stuck, alone forever"". So, I don't want to keep having those dreams, and that is why I am having an extremely hard time finding the motivation to go to bed. Falling asleep isn't the problem, having dreams is. I've felt isolated for so long, sometimes it feels like I'll never have it as good as I used to socially, like I'll never have friends nearby again. Also, I don't know if it matters, but I recently turned 28. I apologize for the length of this. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I started having terrible insomnia but ignored it. Started taking Flonase for a few months and that’s when I eventually stopped sleeping. That went off and on for a while not sleeping/sleeping between going to my parents and staying at my place. Have dreams sometimes but am awake at the same time. I know it was the CBD oil and wish I could turn back time where I never picked up the stuff because before my health was fine. I had started slowly but took up to 3 dropper fulls daily sometimes an additional half a dropper in between. Now I hardly eat and am depressed from not sleeping. Does anyone know of this happening?

Sleep Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/constant-feeling-of-lethargy-numbness-tiredness-and-a-need-to-sleep-694822,"Constant feeling of lethargy, numbness, tiredness, and a need to sleep","Hello For the past year or so, I started noticing that I am feeling very lethargic throughout the day. It started by falling asleep in classes - I am having real trouble staying up during some classes, especially early morning ones, and it usually comes to the point that my body just shuts itself down and I fall asleep without controlling or noticing it. Even after sleeping in classes, I still get the strong urge to sleep at home or even when out with friends My sleep schedule is overall fine. I sleep 6-7 hours every night, and go to sleep and wake up around the same time, and sometimes (not too often) take long naps when I just can't stay up during the day. At weekends or holidays / vacations I sleep for abnormal amount of time even up to ~16 hours a day, and I still get the same feeling of excessive tiredness or lethargy Even when trying to sleep 8 - 10 hours, which shouldn't be too much or too little, nothing changed. I've started to get used to this, but besides the tiredness, I'm also feeling very apathetic and much less enthusiastic or motivated about anything. I don't get excited anymore, its much harder to make me laugh and I just don't find as much joy or care enough about things. I am having SERIOUS problems concentrating, I sometimes completely phase out mid conversations, can't express myself properly, and I'm also having problems with my short term memory. I also get a feeling that is fairly hard to describe, it feels as if I'm always half asleep, have a fried brain and sometimes I just feel like I'm gonna faint or lose my balance. I doubt I am depressed, so I thought I'd rule out that option, but I think I may have some kind of a sleep disorder. Now, I've done a blood test around a month or two ago, everything was completely normal except having extremely low Folic Acid levels, the doctor prescribed me Folic Acid pills, (4 pills 220mg each every day for 2 and a half months.) and so far it hasn't gotten any better. I've also went to some kind of a ""sleep lab"" to undergo a very thorough sleep test. My sleep was perfect, I fell asleep fast, no  , my breathing was fine, REM and deep sleep, everything just as it should be .... I'm thinking maybe it can be something more psychological rather than physical. Thank you ! 0 likes, 0 replies "

Sleep Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/unusual-exercise-induced-insomnia-622168,Unusual exercise-induced insomnia,"TL;DR: I have exercise-induced insomnia for which no one has been able to explain or provide a solution. I used to exercise regularly. I would wake up every weekday at 6am, bike to the gym, and exercise for about an hour before work. I would usually jog or do some other cardio for 20-30 minutes, then do weight training for the rest of the hour. I had help from a personal trainer, so I knew what I was doing. I felt great, and I was in the best shape of my life. I kept this up for about 3 years, before something strange happened: I would wake up around 2 or 3am, unable to fall back asleep. I was 33 at the time, and I know sleep patterns can begin to change around this age. At first, I noticed that I slept much deeper on days I didn't exercise (e.g. weekends). Then I began waking up in the middle of the night, but would usually go right back to sleep. It got worse. Eventually, I would wake about 4 hours after falling asleep with a feeling like an intense adrenaline rush or panic. It would last about an hour, and I would have poor, restless sleep the rest of the night. I did not have trouble falling asleep. I was in bed at 9:30pm every night, then would read a bit with lights out by 10pm. I would fall asleep within 10 minutes. When this started happening, I adjusted my routine. I worked out during lunch, or in the evening. No change. I tried doing more or less cardio vs weight training. No change. Today, if I exercise at any point during the day, I will only get four hours of good quality sleep. I've been to several doctors, sleep specialists, and neurologists. I've had multiple take home sleep studies, as well as one on-site at a medical institution. The only thing they've been able to confirm is that I do indeed wake after 4 hours if I have exercised, but no one can tell me why. Many doctors don't even believe my story -- they think it must be psychological stress that I insist on tying to a physical cause. I have found that walking, low-intensity biking, and hiking are all acceptable forms of exercise that do not trigger my insomnia. I can hike 10 miles and be fine. But if the hike is over very steep terrain, or if I were to jog for 10 minutes, then I have insomnia. So the intensity is definitely a factor. The sleep studies did reveal that I have very mild sleep apnea. My doctors have told me that normally it would not warrant treatment, but it could be related. However, the usual recommendation for such a mild form is simlply ""get more exercise"". My current pet theory is this: following a day of excerise, one's muscles will repair themselves during sleep, usually around 3 or 4 hours into the night. This process requires oxygen from the blood, so if my sleep apnea lowers my blood oxygen levels, then the repair process might cause it to dip below some threshold; my body panics, sending adrenaline through my body to wake me up to address whatever is happening. However, my sleep studies showed my blood oxygenation stayed over 90% the entire night. I'm currently trying out a CPAP treatment. I'm still adjusting to it, but so far it hasn't made any difference. There's no real reason to think that it will, but I'm willing to try anything at this point. When I tell this story, most doctors look at me like I have three heads, so I thought I would seek the collective wisdom of the Internet. Cheers! 1 like, 113 replies "

I had been neglecting sleep due to busy life schedule and since the past 2 years,my lifestyle has been quite unhealthy.Staying awake till 2 am in the morning,sleeping less or even no sleep at all, no workout or gym,loss of appetite..it seems that my body lost the natural rhythm to function properly.I do not feel hungry,energetic or fine as before.I can understand my biological clock and cicardian cycles have been affected and i have forced my body to go off the track ..away from how it should normally function.Plus,i am addicted to excess masturbation and porn watching and so much addicted to it that i cannot quit it despite knowing its ill effects and observing them myself.I have brain fog,poor shabby memory, cannot think or plan or take decisions,get confused easily,forgetting all known things that i knew one by one , even i have difficulty in remmbering new things, recognising faces or distinguishing voices of singers.These symptoms have appeared since the past 2 years and i started PMO as a teenager and still cannot get this demon out of me.BUT, i am going to discuss something serious with respect to my sleep People all over the world suffer from ordinary insomnia.They do not feel sleepy or someone may suffer from excess daytime sleepiness .Sleeping pills may or may not work , but in these cases,the pblm is not feeling sleepy.In my case, the situation is quite ugly and panicing.Now, even if i go to bed early at 11 pm , i cannot sleep.Not only that,the MAIN ISSUE is that even though i feel tired and very sleepy, i cannot fall asleep.When i go to bed and try to sleep,i am just overconscious of the fact that i am trying to sleep or still awake and cannot let go of the things around me which is what a normal person does when he falls asleep.I cannot relax like i used to.Sleep just cannot come and take control of my body like it used to and does for every living being on this earth.Inside me,there is a deep rooted feeling that i have lost that natural inbuilt ability of the brain to switch off and feel that my nerves have become so hyperactive that they cannot detach my consciousness from me during sleep.Previously,sleep was dominant over me meaning it had greater control over me.But, now,alertness seems to be dominant and there is a greater tendency of the body to stay awake.I know my story sounds weird and i shall see a doctor as soon as possible but i came here to discuss this pblm and seek any advices from the people on this forum. When i try to sleep, i get into the TrANSITION PHASE between sleep and wakefulness ,but from there cannot get into deep sleep.Plus, in my subconscious mind, i have that feeling that my brain cannot switch off as if it has lost that ability and i will never fall asleep again.This overconsciousness has greater control over me and despite feeling sleepy, i cannot doze off.Sometimes,i feel restless, sweat and one or two times, i was almost asleep but then suddenly there were some jerks and i woke up.I feel that i have lost that inbuilt mechanism of nodding off.I have this insomnia since july 2018 but things have got stranger since november.And for the past 4 months,this strange scenario has evolved. When i discuss these symptoms with others,people say its phobia of insomnia and depression or may be imbalance of neurochemicals in the brain.My father had such pblms when he was in his 40's but he is perfectly ok now.My mother often talks about this kind of situation that occurs to her during afternoon sleep , but at night everything becomes fine.I do not know what is wrong with my nervous system. i told a doctor about my pblms and he recommended anti anxiety tabs.I have been taking 1/4th of the dose prescribed by him and since the past 3 months,they have worked pretty well except for one or two nights,i have had 7 or 8 hours of sleep almost every night i took the tablet.I take 0.125mg alprazolam and this dose has proved to be quite effective.But, i do not want to rely on this tablet.i want to sleep without it. When i take the tab, and try to sleep, slowly, my mind is calmed and then i try to think on some other issues apart from sleep.I enter a TRANSITION PHASE from wakefulness to sleep and then,without myself realising it , i fall into sleep.This is exactly the way in which a normal man sleeps.I do not have jerks or restlessness or any other significant phobia related thoughts after taking the medicine.When my insomnia took effect in july 2018, initially i did not need these tablets.Occasionally i used to take them.But, my condition has become poorer in the past 4 months.Now,without the tab, i cannot sleep.In my transition phase between wakefulness to sleep, i cannot enter deep sleep or slowly detach myself from the surroundings.That transition phase slowly breaks down and i remain awake.But,so far taking,the medicine has been quite helpful.The doctor prescribed me 0.50 mg daily but i take 0.125mg. I have read enough on the net that excess porn watching can cause high dopamine in the braincells which cause alertness and tendency to remain awake.moreover,GABA ,a neurotransmitter that is required for sleep gets depleted,resulting in insomnia.What i fear is that these effects,if they occur for sufficient time,could they cause damage to nerves and kill them !!! I had also read that staying awake at night for many days causes accumulation of proteins in the brain and these kill neurons.Now, i mostly stay at my house,do not take physical exercise, and spend most of the time on cellphone.Unlike my college days there is no more dynamism in my life.In my family,no one had insomnia or serious troubles due to it. But,2 weeks ago i came to know of a rare but deadly disorder called FATAL INSOMNIA which has no cure and eventually causes horrific death.Actually,in this disease , the part of the brain called thalamus,which is responsible for sleep degenerates due to accumulation of prions in the nerve cells in thalamus that kills them.So,nerve cells cannot communicate between each other during sleep and the result is that the victim completely loses the ability to sleep qnd ultimately dies.It is believed to be quite progressive and kills within 18 months.Moreover,it can be accompanied by certain other symptoms like dementia,fever,etc.I have observed that for the past few days, i feel feverish internally and there seems to be no apparent reason for this.My body temp stays around 98.6° F and i feel extreme daytime dizziness .Moreover, i feel that the anti anxiety tabs have started to be less effective than what they were before.I wonder whether they will someday stop working fully.I read the story of a person named Michael Corke who died at age 41 of fatal insomnia after getting totally sleep deprived for 6 months and these stories freaked me out!! In my mind 24×7 , i think of sleep, the symptoms that i have and feel paniced,and cannot concentrate on other vital life activities.I shall go to a sleep doctor certainly but i want some hints from others in this forum whether my insomnia could be early onset of fatal insomnia .may be the storm is just rising??!! i feel very scared.Not a single day, i could fall asleep without 0.125 mg alprazolam,for the past 4 months. Recently,i observed a change in my beard colour.My beard is black but i found some brown hairs in it which were not present earlier. In my childhood, i would occasionally habe insomnia but it was not serious at all..it lasted hardly for 1 week and it was quite common form of insomnia that people usually have.i would not feel sleepy but if for 2 or 3 days,i had not slept,the very next day, i would automatically feel extremely sleepy and then things were simple..they were not so complicated as now..if i felt sleepy i would doze off easily as i went to bed..and falling asleep was never a matter of concern for me..but now things have got quite complex and the scenario has changed a lot..the pblm now seems to be more serious..i feel extremely sleepy but still cannot sleep.I feel fatigued, and extremely weak but still sleep seems to be far away and out of range as there is a deep rooted feeling inside me that i can never sleep any more!! and it is quite scary also! I do not have to remember what nonsense i did in my life and now paying the price for it.I myself can feel it very well that my body has changed internally as if the neuronal pathways or circuits now are disrupted and the neurons cannot make proper communications with each other or make me fall asleep.I have understood how my unhealthy lifestyle must have changed mt brain as it usually does.I have forced my body to function in a reprogrammed manner after forcing it to abstain from the usual way the programmed human body works since our birth.And i am afraid that i have imported abnormal or destructive features inside my body which were initially not present in it.I feel different from how i used to feel before falling in this pit.Lack of energy,stamina,will power, ..since childhood,there was a natural rhythm in which the body used to work from dawn to bedtime and i have tampered my bio clock and spoiled the rhythm.I am concerned about whether the damage is permanent or is it reversible?and what is the extent of the damage??Addiction of any type changes the brain and deforms the neural pathways.i do not know whether something like this has actually severely affected my sleeping patterns or not..or am i likely to head towards a similar fate as Michael Corke!! ? I feel like a completely different person and stay depressed always..i do not know how i can be back to my own self..how i was before this addiction..it sounds that getting there is impossible..if this is how i have to spend the rest of my life..then nothing uglier than this can occur to me in this world..In fact Michael Corke had initial symptoms of mild INSOMNIA and the doctor diagnosed him with depression at first.Same is the case with me.Like me,he also used to have similar feelings like i cannot sleep or i have lost that ability.These thoughts have given me almost a mini heart attack!!! am i likely to be on the same path as him?porn addiction destroys one's will power by causing shrinkage of frontal lobe of the brain..this is what i read on the net and surely,my brain has been affected a lot!! i do not feel like being myself as before..this insomnia is making my life hell!! scaring me a lot and shifting my focus from other vital aspects of my life .does anyone else suffer from this disease on this forum?I have read that excess dopamine causes wakefulness and alertness and lack of GABA adds to this effect.There has been a huge change in my body chemistry and in my brain,there have been significant chemical changes due to excess masturbation..and these changes can be felt by me inside..i do not need to remember the causes behind them but i can just feel that something is not right inside my body.It is not working normally.

I’m writing on here wondering if anyone has had any experiences with  ? I’m 25 years old and I had my first episode when I was probably 19. Well I hadn’t had it in years since then, but I’ve recently started having it again. It started at the beginning of January, just like the first time I had it I woke up and couldn’t move any part of my body except barely my toes and fingers. I tried to y’all or call out but I could tell I just made a whimpering sound. I was hoping it was a one time thing again but no! I’ve probably had it around 25 to 30 times since then. The other night I had it twice in one night and once when I was trying to fall asleep which is also new for me. Just two nights ago I had it to where I thought my boyfriend was whispering things to me really fast but consciously I knew he wasn’t, he was asleep right next to me and one day I was home alone and I felt like someone was holding me down and it felt literally just like there were hands on my arm but I knew no one was there with me. I also cannot open my eyes at all when I’m experiencing this, which to me is a good thing because I’ve heard some terrifying stories of things people can see. Does anyone else experience sleep paralysis and does this sound similar to your experience? I’ll also mention that I’ve been under quite a bit of stress so I’m wondering if it’s my   that I need to get ahold of or if there’s a chance it could be a sign or some kind of neurological issue or something?!

I then have adrenaline pumping ( not severe though ) but enough to then keep me awake as if I have drunk coffee. I feel adrenalised and can't sleep. I often then reach for melatonin which does sometimes help but not always.  The doctor's just want to give me   and sleeping pills! I am not depressed and I don't want to take sleeping pills as they make me feel rubbish the next day and I don't just want to numb myself I actually want to get to the root of the issue as to what is causing this.  This has been going on for 8 years and is really effecting my life. Can anyone tell me what is going on?? I am a very healthy person. I don't smoke. I don't hardly drink and I eat well and exercise, I also have low blood pressure. If anyone can tell me what this is and/or wha to do about it I would be so grateful as I am very lonely in this as its almost worse being passes from doctor to therapist to healer and have no answers than to actually be diagnosed with something! Can anyone actually help as I have run out of ideas and spent 8 years trying to get better and its still the same, I have just accepted this but its a rubbish way to exist.

Sleep Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/electric-energy-surge-to-brain-when-trying-to-fall-asleep--62180,Electric/Energy surge to brain when trying to fall asleep.,"Hi guys, I'm new to the site but glad I found somewhere to share my symptoms. I'm getting a sort of electrical shock when trying to fall asleep.  This electrical shock seems to be described on other sites as 'jumps' or 'zaps' or 'surges of energy'.  It happens not when I'm sleeping but the moment I am about to fall asleep.  Its like a sort of butterflies feeling in the stomach and then a rush/surge of energy to the brain which gives you a 'jump' and electrical feeling in the head and sometimes upper body.  The more extreme they are sometimes produce a twitch in maybe the arm or leg.  Its not painful but I guess is quite scary when it happens.  These can happen numerous times a night. Many friends/family I have spoken to say this is normal and they are familiar with the symptoms (I understand what they mean as it can be quite similar to when you suddenly wake from a bad dream) but mine seem to be a lot more often and extreme.  I know my symptoms don't seem to be normal.   I've been having these for about 5-6 weeks now (some nights are worse than others) but generally its been more or less every night.  This has turned into a vicious cycle because when you actually close your eyes at night to go to sleep you are actually waiting for the 'shock' to happen instead of trying to sleep.  Obviously the less sleep you have, the less functional you are the next day and so on and so on.  You then get sleep deprived which I believe also may trigger this. The only other thing I can add to my symptoms is sometimes during the day I get a spaced out/empty/dizzy/cloudy feeling in the head (hard to explain).  Sometimes this can turn into a sort of brain/head sensation where you feel you need to kind of 'shake it off'.  Again, its hard to explain, something like if you have restless feet and you need to kick out of it but its in the head so you need to give yourself a shake to snap out of it. I have read quite a bit about anxiety/stress and these symptoms may fall into this category but the issue I have with this, is that I have nothing to be anxious/stressful about!  All is OK with job, money, house, relationship etc so I'm not sure how this all started.  Could I be anxious about this illness?  Again, a vicious cycle? About me - I'm a fit and healthy 35 year old guy.  I actually exercise quite a lot (go to gym/swim 4 times a week and have run numerous marathons over the past year). Although this fitness regime has stopped since I have started having these symptoms as I am feeling quite weak/tired due to not getting much sleep due to it.  I have no major prior illnesses and I am not on any medication.  I don't want to get in the habit of taking sleep medication. I have been to the hospital and spent the night where they performed numerous  /Heart ECG/X Rays/Urine and all came back OK.  The only issue I had was slightly high blood pressure (but not high enough to be put on any medication).  I have also been for an   and EEG epilepsy test.  I will find the results with these in about 5 weeks time. Anyway, that's my symptoms and hopefully someone might feel at ease that they are going through something similar.  Reading similar posts on the internet I don't think anyone has come to the conclusion on what in fact is causing these problems, even though a lot of the people actually been for tests and seen doctors.  Has anyone experienced these issues? Thanks guys, feel free to get in touch  24 likes, 491 replies "

Alone in the dark awake for up to ten hours in a strange place wasn't appealing. When I'd get home and go to bed, my legs would throngs and ache in bed before I fell asleep.

The aches had turned into urged to constantly move and muscle issues. When I was sixteen and a high school dropout due to  , I quit sleeping almost overnight and worried and worried.

Luckily I was monitored at home with a bracelet and was prescribed,  against parents beliefs, to start anti depressants which changed my life for the better. I'm thirty five now and anti depressants no longer work not do anti psychotics. I can only sleep; calm my mind with alcohol. I'm a mess; but o.k. I don't rely on alcohol....I lay awake.

It all started with some nights of bad sleep and then 1 night I couldn't sleep at all. I was prescriped ambien wich helped me sleep for a couple of weeks. I have had   over taking these pills and some nights in the beginning of this period I would be able to sleep without them. During this period i had also health anxiety and got checked up by a doctor who didnt find anything alarming. After that i was able to sleep for 1,5 week without any medications. Then 1 night i started having bad sleep again. This was 3 weeks ago and it have been getting worse. The first week i took a pill  every other day and was able to sleep 5-6 hours. And the nights i didnt take a pill i would get like 2-3 hours of sleep. I went to my doctor and he prescribed mirtazapin wich i have combined with ambien and I was able to get a good nights sleep on it for a week. Now some nights I dont sleep at all even with medications. Two nights ago I took my mirtazapin and combined it with melatonin. I didnt fell asleep. I took an ambien and i didnt fell asleep. I then took another ambien and didnt fell asleep. I was upp all night and i just couldnt fall asleep. That morning i went to the acute psychiatich because the lack of sleep is driving me mad. I havent been able to go to school for the last 3 weeks. They decided i should stay the night here. I sleept okay here last night with a combination of mirtazapin and  . And I'm gonna stay here this night to. Now im just so scared that I have SFI/FFI since my sleep has been getting worse and worse over these last 3 months. I feel more and more empty inside. I feel like pills will soon stop work on me. The last 2 weeks my heartbeats is never less then 80 even when im meditating (normally i have 50-60) and I also have muscle twitches. Both increased heartbeats and muscle twitches are symptoms of SFI. Everybody says its just anxiety thats making it hard for me to sleep but for me its the lack of sleep that is giving me anxiety. Even if I havent slept a single minute one night I cant sleep the next day. I can't be normal to be awake for 48 hours and even after that not being able to sleep. My mind just wont go into sleep phase. Im so scared now and I feel like this insomnia is gonna kill me and that i have SFI.

One day, I woke up, and I had pain in my lower back. It came on gradually, and continued to gradually get worse over 6 months. The sciatica pain started about 3 weeks after my lower back pain. Everything makes it worse. Driving is impossible, walking makes me want to cry. Bed rest doesn’t help. Sitting is out of the question. I can feel it all the way down to my foot. It’s also over time made lifting my left leg difficult too. I don’t know if this is connected. I have almost no reflexes in my right knee and ankle. My GP has referred me to a neurologist and for an MRI because of this and my right sided weakness below my waist. Every day is a battle and the pain is really starting to make me so miserable.  It’s starting to affect my life.  I was referred two weeks ago, the wait is 8 weeks. So I appreciate I’ve got a while yet. I’ve been prescribed Amytriptyline 30mg every night and I take ibuprofen and codeine most days, always when I work because otherwise I cannot make it through the day.  About 4 days ago I felt a lump on my lower right side of my back. It’s hard, it’s not tender to touch but if I push it really hard it does hurt. I thought perhaps it was just swelling or I was just imaging it. Then yesterday, my partner put some bio freeze gel on my back and he said he could feel a hard lump. Is this related? Is it worth seeing my GP again , now that there is a lump? She didn’t examine my back, just tested my leg and reflexes etc. Or do you think it’s nothing to worry about?  Any advice I would be very grateful for! Thank you. 0 likes, 6 replies "

I will say my experience with these stones was fustrating and painful.  Although it can be excurcitingly painful, there is often no quick solution to it. The first time I experience the problem was about 3.5 years ago.  After eating, underneath my chin would swell for 45 minutes to a couple hours.  While the swelling was uncomfortable, I don't remember it as particularly painful.  I went to a number of ENT appointments and had an x-ray taken, but the ENT was never able to confirm the stone, although we both felt pretty confident it was the problem.   I was put on predisone.  I wish the doctor would have gone into more detail about how this medication can affect you.  I had horrible side effects, including: headaches, auditory hallucinations, extreme mood swings, chills and general discomfort.  The predisone did not seem to clear up the stones immediately, but a couple weeks after taking it the problem did go away.   The gland did not give me much of a problem the next 3 years.  It might swell with a single meal every 8-10 months, but nothing of note. This last weekend it began swelling after every meal like the old days.  On a Saturday, the fourth of July, the gland swelled and did not go down after eating.  I rarely drink and I was drinking that day, I'll personally say that I felt beer very much agravated the stone and was at least partially responsible for it getting infected.  Sunday the gland stays inflamed, over the next 48 hours the beginning of what would be excruciating soreness and pain began. It spread to the other side of my neck/chin, throat, jaw gone, teeth and even what felt to be my ear by the end of it.  I also had discomfort and pain when swallowing.  I have since come to understand that the lingering swelling was caused by the infection.  There was puss coming out of the gland underneath my tongue, which was one clue to the infection.  On Monday I went to the ER and then followed up with an ENT specialist.  I was placed on Keflex (antibiotic) and ibprofen, at that point I declined the predisone as I wasn't sure it had done much the last time and it caused horrible side-effects.  I was also instructured to suck on lemon drops, drink lots of water, apply a hot compress and massaged inside/outside of the mouth on the gland.  I did all of these things as religiously as I could.  My plan with the doctor was to regroup in a week after trying these things.  Monday night/Tuesday morning I had extreme pain and started to feel a lot of anxiety about feeling this way for an entire week.  I called the doctor Tuesday morning and told her what I just wrote (I was extremely emotional from the pain and lack of sleep).  I decided to try the prenisone again and she wrote a script for pain management.  I will say calling my doctor was a very good decision, if you experiencing worsening of your symtoms, even if it is mostly increased pain, please call your physician and find a better plan of care.  She ordered a CT for early the next week too.   I took the predisone around 2pm this afternoon.  I continued with the others instruction (lemon drops, warm compress, massaging gland, etc).  Pain seemed to get to a more managable level about 4 hours after taking the medication and another dose of ibprofen (600 mg), still a lot of discomfort though. Well about 6pm I begin pushing a LOT of pus out while massaging the gland, it just kept coming for about an hour.  At this point I could finally visualize the stone on the base of gland and was excited because I thought this meant the doctor would be able to remove it.  Luckily for me, it popped right out.  I could immediately feel the gland relieving some of the pressure and an hour later am experiencing  only some lingering swelling (much reduced) and tenderness on the outside of my neck/chin.  No pain when swallowing anymore.  No pain underneath the tongue.   If anyone is ever dealing with a similar situation, I'd love to answer questions about when helped me.  I feel like I was really scared and anxious through this process and I'd like to help others that might be going through it.  0 likes, 21 replies "

I want to share with you how I have managed my rosacea quite well. Since I found the brand trilogy very gentle range (from New Zealand) but delivers international. It saved my red face. The moisturising cream / cleanser and mask are so gentle they don’t cause any reactions. It’s so moisturising it reduces my redness over night. I really recommend these products if u have dry skin with redness. And if you flush and are burning I’ve learnt that’s because your skin doesn’t like what your currently doing to it and for me it’s because my skin is dry. I used to sleep with a fan directly on me all night which caused very bad flushing all day because I wasn’t freezing cold in front of my fan, as soon as I stopped using my fan my skin has stopped flushing and burning and has dramatically improved!! I use the trilogy gentle moisturiser in the morning and then sleep with the mask on because there all natural products and this works for me!  For this type of rosacea I don’t believe medicine and topical gels help most the time they have made my skin worse. But propanadol sometimes works for my   induced flushes! I have recently purchased a red light which I hope is going to improve and repair my skin!  0 likes, 0 replies "

I am 22 and had jaw pain in my right joint (forget the actual) but it started on my left parotid gland. At first I thought it was jaw muscle, but now I’m more persuaded to the parotid gland. My symptoms are now numbness is that area and bit of the neck. I went to my dentist before I knew about the parotid gland and he said I have a little bit of signs of grinding my teeth but not much. I noticed a small moveable bump under my salivary gland by the front left teeth that the hygienist said it’s probably a blocked gland.  Also my bottom wisdom teeth haven’t come completely out of the gums and he said that could be the issue. Weeks go by with numbness continually and pain in the jaw joints and now I’m freaking out with my mind going to the worst. I got dental X-rays and he never said anything about a tumor but I also didn’t ask. I also got a head ct and  ct angiography done 2 weeks ago. Would those 2 CT’s show anything for jaw tumors or parotid tumors? I know they’re rare, but my anxiety goes crazy over things like this. I have another dentist appointment next week but just wanted to know if I should rush to have it this week or wait it out. Thanks everyone 0 likes, 2 replies "

It was terrible.  Abnormal CT scan showed multiple pulmonary nodules indicating infection/inflammation. 2nd CT scan in April showed no change favoring infection/inflammation. All bloodwork labs are normal, no allergies, have reoccurring post nasal drip- CT scan of sinuses are normal.  3 radiologists reviewed my CT scan and all stated it favors infection/inflammation largest nodule is 1.5inches. Ground glass opacity, lymph nodes are subcentimeter and not enlarged.  Lesions are in my upper lobes (3 measured in right lung and 2 measured in left lung) there is a small scar on my lung-mentioned in CT scan Lung specialist mentioned sarcoidosis. Had a lung function test- pulmonologist said my results were good.  Had bloodwork done to rule out tuberculosis (very unlikely) and ACE to see if it would be elevated (results are pending)  Pulmonologist said she believes it’s sarcoidosis. Have to do a follow up CT scan in July. Lost weight (10 lbs) but was on a “eat clean” diet to help boost my immediate system (was on antibiotics for 20 days for sinus infection after the flu)  I am petrified it’s cancer although I’ve mentioned my fear and anxiety of this several times and was told it’s “not likely” and I am “low risk” of all the things they think it is cancer is at the bottom of the list-sarcoidosis is more at the top.  Symptoms now- I have a dry cough, mostly like a quick clearing or urge to clear my chest and it doesn’t produce phlegm. Sometimes it’s a tickle in my throat that causes the cough most of the time i cough once or twice at random- this is ongoing thoughout the day.  Some times the cough gives me the feeling that I’m trying/straining to clear out my bronchial tubes/center airway. Had a sputum test done Friday- results pending  I sleep OK most of my lack of sleep is from anxietyand fear of the unknown.  I can walk at length, go up steps, Chase my 3 year old and  am not winded.

I am Caucasian and a male. Ex smoker of nine years. I quit five years ago. I am going through steps on getting a diagnosis. Brief history on what's going on.  I am a Pharmacy Technician in a hospital and while I was working back in June 2018, I started getting really sharp pain underneath left shoulder blade that eventually got extremely painful and went to my chest, especially when inhaling/exhaling. I ended up in the emergency room. They immediately suspected pleurisy. They took blood and a chest X-ray. Chest X-Ray showed was completely abnormal. Showing Bilateral filling in hilar as well as enlarged lymph nodes in mediastinum. As well as a airspace opacity in my upper left lobe. After they did A Chest CT with contrast that confirmed bilateral lung infiltrates with ground glass opacity, lymph node enlargement in the hilar, mediastinum, and one in the gastrohepatic area. Specific nodes noted was, right paratracheal, subcarinal. The largest one measured 2.5 CM. They suspected pneumonia but said other things couldn't be ruled out (HIV, Tuberculosis, Lupus, Lymphoma and Sarcoidosis). I started a 10 day course of Doxcycycline After a follow up they decided to do another CT with Contrast in 5 weeks to see if there is an improvement. Blood was ran to rule TB and HIV which both were negative. ACE was done which was 41 which is considered in normal range. LDH was 210 which was also in normal according to the labs. A day later I started bringing up mucus with blood in it. After finishing the antibiotic both the mucus/blood and pain went completely went away and has not come back which made me think I actually did have an infection. The 5 week repeat showed improvement in the main infiltrate in the upper left lobe and mild improvement in the other infiltrate in the other lobe. Some of the lymph nodes shrank 2-3 MM. The one that measured 2.5cm was now 1.9 cm. This scan showed some borderline spleen enlargement though. My GP was done with it even though resolution was completely there.  I decided to get a second opinion with a pulmonologist. He decided to do another CT in another 5 weeks. This scan, according to the radiologist showed no change however the lymph node noted was 2mm less compared to the previous. My pulmonologist confirmed that there was very slight improvement but my spleen has increased in size by 2 CM. He is thinking Lymphoma or Sarcoidosis at this point but spleen leans more towards lymphoma. I had a PET-CT done a few days ago that showed some uptake supraclavicular area although that area isn't enlarged. enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes with the hottest uptake at 15.3 in the mediastinal. Retroperitoneal lymph nodes with uptake measurement of 12.2. Spleen enlargement was again noted and findings were concerning for a process such as Lymphoma.  After a follow up with my pulmonologist, they now want to do a biopsy with bronchoscopy-EBUS or mediastinalscopy. I chose bronch first, then the other if the broncho fails. My Dr. is still leaning more towards sarcoid and said that sarcoid can make a PET light up. I'm just not convinced since there was some really hot areas but I don't know. Anyway, very anxious about this. I just want some opinions about this. As of now I have no symptoms related to lungs. Never had shortness of breath. The symptoms that I did have have went away after antibiotics. I understand the most if not any of you are doctors and I am not looking to get a diagnosis on the internet. I'm just curious if any of you have had an enlarged spleen at diagnosis and had uptake on your petscans. Thank you in advance for the help. 0 likes, 4 replies "

Sarcoidosis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/sarcoidosis-not-enough-care-and-attention-given-to-sufferers-37960,Sarcoidosis - not enough care and attention given to sufferers,"Hi, I've only just joined this forum but as a long term sufferer of Chronic Sarcoidosis  I thought maybe I could say a few things on the matter. First of all I was shocked to read that one of the forum members had been told by his specialist that   are not a symptom of sacoidosis. Nonsense! night sweats and indeed profuse sweating during the day are symptoms of Sarcoidosis. The lack of support for people suffering from sarcoidosis is dreadful but the truth is that not enough is known about the disease and especially amongst UK doctors. American doctors are more on the ball but then they have the money for research etc in the US. I spend my entire time fighting and arguing with health people, trying to get appropriate treatment for my various symptoms. Luckily I have an excellent  respiratory specialist but that is all he is a respiratory specialist so when it comes to all the other problems I have due to sarcoidosis such as skin, eyes and nerves I have to fight to get tests and treatment as either no one believes me or they think it is up to my respiratory specialist to deal with it. He in turn kicks it back to my GP (rightly so) and at the end of the day nothing gets done as no one will take responsibility for the symptoms! It's a ridiculous situation but it boils down to money as all these MRIs and tests are very expensive and neither party wants to foot the bill. The over powering fatigue is dreadful and I can literally fall asleep in mid conversation. Also the depression that comes from constantly feeling unwell and the frustration of fighting for proper care also takes it's toll. The sweating I spoke about earlier, can not only hit at night either as I find that expending a little energy just hoovering a carpet can cause sweat to literally drop off me. At the moment I have severe pain and severe pins and needles in both arms and hands and it has taken me 6 months to finally talk my GP into allowing me to see a neurologist. I will see her tomorrow but my respiratory specialist told me not to hold out too much hope of being believed! So you see even the doctors who understand Sarcoidosis know the taboo within the health sector so what chance do we have? I was originally on high doses of steroids but unfortunately they caused me to have a psychotic break so I had to be taken off them so I am now on an inhaler and mucosal thinner to try to combat the extremely thick, sticky sputum I cough up.In one sense I suppose I am luck as I am already in a wheelchair due to nerve damaged feet (hospital screw up!) but I had to change to an electric wheelchair because with being so breathless and having nerve problems in both arms I couldn't propel myself around in my manual one. I say I'm lucky to be in a wheelchair only because without it I wouldn't be able to get around at all because of the sarcoidosis. I sometimes wonder if UK doctors have a bad attitude towards sarcoid sufferers because they think everyone only has the acute sarcoidosis and it would probably resolve itself  or even come and go undetected in it's own time. I really don't know but what I do know is that they need to become better informed about this disease and be more caring when treating their patients. It's not a deadly disease but it certainly takes its toll on the sufferer and the symptoms need correct and fast treatment before they become a real problem. Keep your chin up fellow sufferers and don't be scared to be pushy with your GP. He has a comittment to treat his patients whether he thinks its serious or not. You have a right to demand to see a specialist or to get a second opinion but do remember that not everything is linked to your sarcoidosis so if you develop a new problem make sure you get it checked out properly and don't be fobbed off with your GP saying it's just a symptom of your sarcoid because it could be a different health issue altogether. 21 likes, 1046 replies "

I have reoccurring-mild and so annoying- oral thrush so my pulmonoligist ordered an Immune Deficiency test.  My CD4, CD8 and CD3 levels are all low.

I have had this for a while but it’s got really bad recently. I’m 14 so it’s not a wear and tear thing you get with old age. I have been experiencing  -upper back pain -neck pain (left side) -shoulder pain (left side) -collar bone pain (left side) -left ribs hurt and if I suck in they are a different shape and more prominent than the right side. -lower back pain in the right side -tightness, tingling and a tiny bit of numbness on top of right foot near my toes. It feels as though I have hit my funny bone but in my foot. My sister has scoliosis and she had the surgery for it. My mum and grandma both have kyphosis which is what I’m thinking it could be, when I bend forward there is a tiny curve but probably not big enough for the scoliosis diagnosis. My hand sometimes gets pins and needles in it (for no reason). My neck feels like I have slept on it funny and it feels heavy. I feel like it’s so much effort to hold my head up. I’m always clenching my jaw in the night too which doesn’t help. Eveytime I yawn I feel sick which is very weird too. So is this cancer? Could it be a tumour on my back or neck? There is no visible lumps though. I have angry looking stretch marks on my upper back on my left side (there is only a few but they are very deep and long going horizontal.

I was diagnosed with scoliosis when I was 11 (now 38) and I was borderline at the age of 16 of getting a operation due to my curve (S shaped). I used to get awful back pain but due to that subsiding I decided against the operation and have had no issues as such.  I have always had one hip higher than the other and clothes can look funny on me and just don’t sit right which I’m sure a few of you can sympathise with. I’ve had a feeling that I’m beginning to shrink and a few of my friends have politely pointed out that I look lop sided and along with feeling short of breath I’m beginning to wonder if this is connected to my scoliosis. I had a lung x-Ray a few months back and they mentioned that they could see I had scoliosis. The last time I seen anyone was over 20 years ago so my question is, do you think I should ask for a review? I’m in no pain as such so don’t want to use up valuable resource time but just wondering if this is something I should get checked from time to time?  Many thanks in advance.  0 likes, 6 replies "

I dont want to waste NHS resources but am concerned this gets worse with age, (I watched this happen to my mother.)   My back and shoulders are not in pain but feel very stiff.   Should I go back to the GP and ask for investigations or treatment?    I have not had an x-ray since i was 9 (looking for scoliosis due to family history.)   This was inconclusive due to young age. Should I ask the GP to be able to see a physio, osteopath, get an xray, or ask to see an orthopedic doctor ???    I do not know which exercises to do (and which might make things worse...). I was told that due to family history my chances of getting it was 1/8.... however 3 generations of women in my family have it so I wonder if it it true...

This type usually becomes a very bad type of scoliosis. Others like me only get adolescent scoliosis, with me it was detected when I was 19 years old, it's a 20° S curve. Why is that so? I'm guessing that the juvenile scoliosis typically gets so bad because when they reach adolescence a growth spurt sets in and makes it worse. But why did I develop it at adolescence and not right in the beginning? Does this have nothing to do with nutrition and underweight? And why are girls much more likely to develop scoliosis? I think it was something like 3/4 or 2/3 of girls that develop scoliosis, the rest beig boys. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Secondly - I know I should visit an orthopedic specialist - I already did. Hey guys. I need a little help with my scoliosos. When I was 20 I started to notice some rib hump on my left side and assymetrical chest. I knew it was a scoliosis so I went to visit an orthopaedist . He told me it is not serious at all and he did not even made X-ray because he said it is not necessary. He showed me some excersises and told me to move more. I was not quite sure, so I went to another doctor and he told me the same - my scoliosis is not serious any if I will work out and exercise it will get better. This is how my scoliosis looked then, when I visisted those both doctors. -  So I did my exercises and tried some yoga, but as I went to the college I stopped exercising and spent a lot of time only sitting behind books or computer. My only exercising was tennis, which I still play very often (I know it is not the best sport for scoliosis). Now 4 years later I visited the doctor again and he told me the same. It is not serious and I should doing exercises and so on. He has not told me much. What kind of scoliosis it is, what exercises are best. I try to gain some information about my scoliosis to find best exercises as I finally have time to work out and get it better. This is how my scoliosis looks today (not a much difference, but you can clearly see the scioliosis in the thoracic area?) -   Also my left nipple seems lower as my left side of chest is not so prominent.  What do you think? It is still not that serious? Doctors I visited did not even do Xray. I woud like to know, which side is my weak side. Left or Right? Is it thoracic scoliosis or lumbar? And which side should I work out more. Also if you can help with some good exercises, you can write them down. I know that not all of you are othopeadist here, but only if you could tell me some little things. Thank you very much. I really want to change it and know more about my scoliosis and exercise, but doctors in my town and country, they do not tell me much. Only that it is minor (but why my ribs and chest is assymetrical?). And I can afford seeing other specialist. Can you maybe recommend some good videos on youtube or your own experiences?

Now just within the past month i have been getting this awful pain in the middle of my back to the point where I cannot move. I went to see me doctor and they did an x-ray and said they did not find anything to be shifted or wrong. it has been happening more often in the last week now.

I had a moderate infection and my doctor told me nothing about cleaning my house bed and car.

Mop your hard floors wood and tile with boiling hot water. Assume they are everywhere. I boiled my clothes too which ruined some and ruined some sneakers. But the boiling was the turning point and I'm glad I did it. I bought a turkey fryer with a propane tank because boiling all my clothes indoors was too much for my landlord. Turkey fryer cost $70 at Lowes and propane tank another $50. If you have permanent carpet you may want to move to a hotel or get out of there for at least three days as the mites cant live past three days without a meal.  The Permethrin cream should be applied more than just once every two weeks as my doctor said. If you can get your hands on more apply it more. I went to a third world country and no prescription was necessary and I applied it every day for three days without any side effects. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Scabies,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/scabies-finally-cured--633645,Scabies finally CURED... ,"So first things first, I am not selling, trolling or gloating. After having scabies for the last 6 months (2 knowingly) i can say that I am finally cured. For the first three months of having this awful affliction I was convinced it was something else (guttate psoriasis) due to having this skin problem previously and the somewhat similar symptoms. When the symptoms never improved I consulted my doctor who agreed with my self-diagnosis and assured me it would cease over time. (no blame one the doc's front, i was positive this was my condition). My symptoms started off manageable, itchy spots on my ass but nothing insanely unmanageable. After a while the 'rash' spread and more than 3 hours sleep became a distant dream. I would typically fall asleep at 2am exhausted wake up at 4am - itch for 2 or 3 hours and then fall back asleep for another 2 to 3 hours sleep max. before having to go to university. My body was covered in 'bites', mutilated and the eternal itch or crawling which could not be scratched, my skin is crawling now just thinking. I only realised i had scabies when an ex-partner came to visit, we spent a few days in bed together, one or two months later he experienced symptoms and consulted his doctor (in Germany) who diagnosed scabies. He was immediately prescribed 5% permethrin cream, two doses, two weeks apart in his case (i think 30ml per dose). Upon hearing his diagnosis i immediately went to my local pharmacy (UK) and bought one 30ml tube of permethrin 5% cream and applied that night as per instruction. The pharmacist told me to do 2 treatments, one week apart. I did 4 weeks treatment (30ml each), a week apart each, i wanted to be sure to rid of this horrible affliction and reasoned that this should be sufficient. After 4 weeks i ceased treatment in the hope that i was cured (my 'bites' and scarring were improved remarkably) but after 11 days i felt the familiar 'crawling' sensation once more and seen what appeared to be more 'bite' marks. This may be post-scabies, I am not sure but i know that I was so sick and tired of this infestation that I needed to take every precaution I could. Note that after every topical application I would clean all my bed linen, vacuum carpets, sofa etc. (maybe not neccessary but desperate). i would not wear any clothes for one week since last application after being on a 60 degree wash and tumble dry.  My mind really did not think of much else, i did not want to hug my mother incase of infection, having sex was out of the question, i even felt guilty when shaking peoples hands. I know this is all probably all irrational but if you are reading this then i am sure you know what i mean!?!? Anyways after ordering some ivermectin horse paste online from amazon which i never received i decided to try the permethrin again this time on a faster application timeline. This time i applied one full body application every 5 days for 20 days ( i was scared this was dangerous and it may be) and thankfully it seems to have worked for me. I am now confident I am scabie free and wish you all the best. I should also point out that my partner who i infected has been completely scabie free for months now after only 2 permethrin treatments, I may have been hypochondriacal to the post scabies.  Regardless, I will never know although i only know now that i am scabie free and wish to tell you that it does happen, almost as quick as they appear it feels now. Dont give up, for me, multiple permethrin treatments and switching clothing seemed to work, GOOD LUCK AND DONT GIVE UP! YOU CAN HAVE A NORMAL LIFE AGAIN SOON!!!!!!!! 0 likes, 4 replies "

Now, as I have quite severe  , I am considering my mind may just be playing tricks and as I have a minor itch, I've started thinking I'm itching all over. I can't see any lumps etc at the moment and the groin itch seems to disappear for most of the day, and will randomly come back and then disappear again after a few seconds. It starts as more of a tickle than anything else. My pubic region also feels a bit odd when I touch/scratch etc it, but I think that could be just due to some anxety scratching causing a little damage. As I've read that generally the itch doesn't go away, I'm half thinking it is purely anxiety. So my question is, when scabies symptoms show up, does the extreme itching start straight away, or does it slowly increase from a minor itch like what I have? I should add that I also don't get an increase in itch at night (if anything I notice it less) and no change after a warm/hot shower. 0 likes, 5 replies "

Scabies,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/scabies-judgement-and-society-678590,"Scabies, judgement, and society","Yep, i was officially diagnosed with scabies today. I already presumed it was likely. Of course i'd've rather been told it was just poison ivy or sumac, but it's not the end of the world. Thankfully, it's a treatable diagnosis. I still wonder if i got it from hiking through the woods a few times in the past month, or from wading in a creek, or from weeding the walkway in my parents backyard, or if my friend had it and never said so before we hugged each other goodbye. But i guess i'll never know. Anyway, my bigger questions revolve around telling people. I am currently staying with my parents for a few months, checking in on them (they're 72) before moving out of state again. Therefore, telling my household would mean telling my judgmental American parents that i've made whatever poor choices led to a scabies infestation -- and not just a scabies infestation in my skin, but a scabies infestation in their very household! So. I know Mom mentioned itching about two weeks prior to my noticing my itches, and she believed the itches were related to something in her bedroom. Then, when i noticed my itches seemed a bit abnormal (possibly  ?), i asked Mom and Father if either of them had any itches that day, and Mom informed me hers had gone away. Father said he had itched for just a couple days, a few days prior to my first set of itches, and that it had gone away. It's mosquito season, and bug bite season. When i first noticed, i thought they were mosquito bites. And maybe that's all my parents experienced. When i considered the idea that i had contracted bedbugs, about a week ago, i decided to wash all of my laundry -- about 4 or 5 loads of clean and dirty clothes, bedding, towels, anything cloth and in my bedroom, on all the hottest settings. And i inspected the bed for bedbugs and found nothing, and i vacuumed the carpet thoroughly. And i slept in a tent for three nights, to see if the itching would stop. It didn't stop, exactly, but it did lessen. I imagine now, that i must have killed off a sizable number of mites. Anyway, neither parent has mentioned itching anymore in the past week. I sort of want to tell them i have scabies so they can defend themselves against it in case i've already unknowingly spread it. But i don't want to tell them if they don't need to know. I don't need to hear how i'm living my life all wrong, and how i'd be better off sitting inside watching TV like they do, or how i'm banned from any nature walks while staying on their property. So what do you think? What's the consensus? And i also recently visited one of my newer friends' households for the first time, a little over a week ago. (This was about the time i was beginning to wonder if those were all mosquito bites, or if they could be something else...perhaps bedbugs.) This friend sort of tried to seduce me that one time, and we ended up cuddling for the latter half of a movie. I guess that means i could have carried scabies into my friend's house.

Scabies,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/how-we-cured-our-scabies-after-6-months-ordeal-680360,How we cured our scabies after 6 months ordeal ,"Hola, I waited until we were absolutely sure we were cured before posting this as I know how unbelievable it is to get cured of scabies, but it’s possible and we did it. We are a family of 3, my husband and I plus a little one age 2 when we were diagnosed of scabies. We fought unsuccessfully for 7 months until finally I decided to get away from the usual toxic medical treatments. This is what we did for 7 months and how we failed: -          We treated only with topical permethrin (cream 5%). The first mistake we made was not to treat us all: as only our child was diagnosed. Second mistake:  when we realised that we all have to be treated we didn’t do it at the same time (our child was treated on a Fri and we were on a Wed) and I believe this overlapping in the treatment time was good enough for the scabies to move from our child to us and vice versa. Third mistake: we didn’t treat our faces and scalps. It was only when I realised that my child and I got them in those areas (noses and scalps itching like hell) that I decided to start using permethrin in faces and scalps. Four mistake: I didn’t take it seriously about treating the house, our house is clean and tidy by any standards for clean people and I thought that was enough so I didn’t change our bedding and clothes daily, I didn’t treat the sofas, carpets, pillows, cushions, mattresses, etc... Fifth and most important of all the mistakes: we treat our skin with permethrin only. After reading nonstop about scabies, their life cycle, eggs and hatching time we realised using the topical treatment as advice by doctors (twice with each application 1 week apart) is not enough to kill some of the eggs that are hatching during the time the permethrin is not acting on the skin, also permethrin DOES NOT KILL the eggs, therefore is not good enough a treatment.   This is how after suffering for 7 months we were successful and got rid of scabies completely, it took us 6 weeks. -          Cooking salt -          Borax (pure borax, NOT Acid boric). -          Hydrogen Peroxide  3%  HP -          Coconut oil -          Baby oil -          Vaseline -          Tea tree oil -          Clove oil -          Lavender oil Treatment here: -          We fill up the bath tub for a nomal bath with warm water and added 2 cups of Borax and 1 cup of HP.  We went in and with wet bodies stood up and proceeded to do an immaculate exfoliation with salt, using our hands (I couldn’t do this to my child, instead I added 3 cups of salt to his bath, in addition to Borax and HP) putting plenty of salt we exfoliated our bodies, after a minute of exfoliating our hands become amazing scrubbers, kept  putting plenty of salt in our hands and exfoliated every bit of our bodies, we couldn’t scrub our faces or scalp, instead we just put some salt on them. Then we lay in the bath for 20-30 minutes, scalp and faces getting washed constantly with this water.  After that we never rinsed our bodies with fresh water, never never, we wanted that lovely salt and borax drying out the scabies and eggs, then we dried air our skin, no towels, and we dried our hair with hair dryer. -          Before bed we applied good amount of baby oil with clove oil, the combination was 10/1. Which means 100 ml of baby oil and 1 ml of clove oil. We applied this everywhere including or faces and scalps. Its a bit stingy on the face but it goes after a couple of minutes. We made sure it didn’t go in our genitals because its unbearable there. For our child I couldn’t apply this mixture, the first time I tried he screamed in pain so I only treated it him with baby oil combined with tea tre oil 10/2, which means 100 ml baby oil and 20 ml tea tree oil. We didn’t do a stronger combination of oils as we read that they could be very irritating. -          So, this was our routine for 6 weeks: exfoliation with salt until our body couldn’t take it anymore because it was painful, it was 4 days for me, 6 days for my husband and never for my child. When we couldn’t do the exfoliation we put the salt in the bath, about 3 cups for our child and 6 for my husband and for me. Then we bath for 10 days in Borax and HP. At night we put the clove oil mixture in our bodies every night and in our scalps 3 times a week, tea tree mixture for my child in his body every night and scalp a couple of times a week. We rested our bodies from Borax and HP baths for a week and started again for 10 more days. -          In between resting from Borax and HP baths we kept doing baths with salt or scrubbing when the body could take it and oils every night. -          Important: we treated our noses and ears putting in a Vaseline pot a few drops of tea tree oil, a pot of 50 ml with 10 drops of tea tree oil, we applied this not only every night in our noses and ears but every time we felt itchiness during the day, we did this with cotton buds. I kept a pot of Vaseline and tea tree oil permanently in my bag so every time my child or I needed it was available.  -          I also prepared many pots of coconut oil with tea tree oil, same combination as above and kept them in all the rooms of the house so if we felt itchiness we just opened the pot and applied this in the itchy area during the day. We also used this combination sometimes instead of clove oil mixture if we felt that our skin was a bit too stressed from the treatment. -          After 6 weeks we stop the salt, Borax and HP treatment but have continued with the essential oils until today and for a long time until I forget we all once have this. Today what we do is alternate Baby oil with clove oil with baby oil with tea tree oil and baby oil with lavender oil 10/2 which is fantastic to repair the skin. We now put tea tree oil in the bath every night, we put 15-20 drops in a full bath tub. We treat our scalps occasionally: mine with clove oil and my child’s with tea tree oil. I do this just in case. -          We treated all our house twice during this 6 weeks with Borax (borax in the carpets and mattresses), I put away all the cushions and unnecessary furniture or decorations, our pillows and bedding I either wash or hot dry every day, hot dry for an hour in the machine. -          We also treated our shoes with borax, all our coats, hats...anything that I couldn’t hot wash. -          I added half a cup of Borax to every washing.  -          I slept with socks on my hands to help stopping contaminating my face with my hands and vice versa. I hope this helps, 6 weeks treating our skins like this we were cured, it has taken us a couple of months more to get rid of the irritation in the skin, it’s not a visual irritation, it’s mainly the feeling of itchiness that makes us feel we still got them but we know we are now cured. During this 2 months of recovery we have all being seen twice by specialists who have checked us thoroughly under their microscopes and have done test and the conclusion has always been: we do not have scabies anymore. We also know we haven’t got them because when a new spot comes out it never turns into a rush after a couple of days what happens is that it disappears.  We get a couple of new spots here and there, especially in the areas that were affected 2 months ago but magically they disappear within 2 days which make us confirm it is the body healing and it’s a process that takes time.  Be strong, get the responsibility of your own health in your hands and start acting now, if we got cured of scabies you can do it, ask me any questions, I owe all my knowledge to all the blogs I read and to all the suggestions people made, based on their and our own trial and errors we designed our treatment and we hope we can now help others (Remember!! We are not doctors, we were sufferers). 0 likes, 0 replies "

Scabies,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/does-this-look-like-a-positive-burrow-ink-test--682521,Does this look like a positive Burrow Ink Test?,"tl;dr - Based on the photos attached, after visiting two doctors already would you pay another $400 to see a dermatologist or just buy permethrin from the pharmacy? So my symptoms began 6-8 weeks ago. I started getting itchy in a few spots (tiny bumps on my hands) and noticed what seemed like bug bites on my torso. Since in one area they appeared in what looked like a line of 3 my first thought was bed bugs, but I didn't see any signs of them although since I've been staying on a friend's dark colored couch recently it wasn't easy to tell for sure. It started getting worse so I looked up my symptoms online and became convinced I had scabies, even though it didn't really look anything like the pictures online it seemed similar and was extremely itchy at night. So I went to a doctor and told them I suspected scabies which was probably a mistake because she hardly looked at me, and not even up close, said ""yeah could be, here's a prescription for permethrin and some antihistamines"". I asked if they could do the skin scrape test but she said they don't do that, of they think it even might be scabies they just give you the cream. I bought an extra cream for my flatmate and used an entire bottle, took all laundry to the laundromat, vacuumed everything, etc. on the 21st of September.  Only after I had used all the cream did I realize you were supposed to use it again a week later.  Approximately 2 weeks later it seemed as though it was getting worse, the itching was absolutely unbearable and would wake me up in the middle of the night, if I was lucky enough to get to sleep in the first place. I didn't even want to be around anyone for fear of spreading this gross and terrible infestation. I visited another doctor but simply said for a rash and showed her everything.  Only after she started it looked like dry skin and an allergic reaction of some kind did I mention my suspicion of scabies and I pointed out areas I thought might be indicative which she looked at very closely and said it is 100% not scabies. When I kept pointing out more spots she said ""no no no it's definitely not and you need to stop thinking about that or you'll scratch more and make it worse"". I left feeling relieved but still frustrated I didn't know the cause. Oh and with 2 new antihistamines and some hydrocortisone cream. I know my skin and I know this is not normal, especially lasting 6 weeks or more. Nothing has helped. Not the 6 different allergy meds, the lotions or creams, and stinky Pinetarsol shower gel. The only thing that provides temporary relief is putting something cold on the itchy areas. Since I'm traveling and this isn't an ""emergency"" my travel insurance does not cover these visits and paying full price for a non-resident has already cost me close to $500 to no avail. A dermatologist would cost around $400. I'm happy to pay that if it resolves the issue but considering all the money I've wasted so far I'm hesitant to do so. Previously I never noticed anything resembling ""burrows"" but recently I have seen some areas I thought could be so I did the ink test where I applied ink to the affected area and wiped it off. As you can see from the photos there is a definite line in some areas. A few days ago my neck area was itchy (photo included) but it looked more like an allergic reaction and has calmed down since. I know much of the red marks on my torso and some of the cracked skin on my palms is likely due to scratching, but I really try my best not to. It's just absolutely unbearable. So for those of you that have had scabies, did it look like this? Based on the ""results"" of my self administered ink test would you just get the permethrin from the pharmcy and do the treatment again (twice) or would you pay the $400 to see a dermatologist?

This is going to sound freaking crazy, but lots of people that I know has seen this happen to me.  Working on the floor of cottage (surrounded by woods), I get scabies.  Didn't know what they were until I went to Dr. A few weeks after getting them, I was coming out of laundry room and felt something like a pinch. When I looked- I was full of ticks! Freaking out- I tried to remove some and gave up after screaming each time I tried to. They really do latch on.  I went to bed and told no one. When I got up In the morning all of the ticks were dead and drained flat.  After that, when I tried to dig into my skin, it would turn a yellowish color and be almost impossible to get through the skin. Got my meds for scabies. Scabies gone and what's left of the ticks sink into my skin.     Once again, try to work on this run down cottage and get skin mites- I'm moving!  Take the meds, start to get rid of them and boom- they're back in full force! I had forgotten about my car seat covers. While waiting for the ivermectin to come in-my skin is just zinging and larvae is coming out of my pours- I'm covered. After the last time and having delt with bed bugs(thinking I got rid of those but no, still have the nasty things- I freak out about bugs. So this 2nd time- all I see are bugs everywhere. One night, I feel a pinch and look at my arms- an army of ticks. This time I show my whole family and they freak out too. After pulling the ones on my face off- ouch  I go to bed. Get up in the morning- once again, ticks are flat and dead and being used! I show my family again. Make an appt with disease specialist. He tells me that they are not scabies, - can't be cuz they're not in the right place, says nothing about the ticks, tells me don't touch or scratch at all, and see you in 2 weeks.  I get home completely disappointed. And look up skin mites. I realize because I have scabies bad, that it's Norwegian scabies. And that they can be anywhere on your body, mine are covering face and arms. So I use a tube of permitherine that a friend gave me and a full dose of ivermectin- the mites themselves are coming out to die. And there are hundreds! But what the heck about the ticks and the tick cement that the scabies had used? Found nothing online.  I know I'm not crazy- others have seen the tick thing too.

I thought I was clear until my girlfriend slept in my bed and started itching. She said it only happens when she's at my place.  Then I noticed a very straight line that looked almost like a scratch mark on her thigh, and other one on her shoulder. Noticed one on my forearm, too.

I read you need direct and prolonged contact to catch the mites, but I don't know how long prolonged is? The only contact I had with her directly was touching her index finger and feeling between the thumb and index finger and on her arm for specific muscles I had to put electrodes on, and placing those electrodes and taping them down. It took about 10 minutes to set up all the equipment, but I probably had direct contact with her skin for a total of maybe 5-8 minutes tops, with individual contact times no more than 30 seconds I reckon?

We have 6 children. The only reason I figured out it was scabies was that they started to finally spread to our kids. Now I have tried everything from bleach baths to shea butter, to ivermectin. I cant keep up with the sanitizing with so many children. Were like a tiny infested village. I can keep them off the kids constantly fighting back and forth to keep the kids from catching them.

(I don't doubt that some of the people on here truly have been struggling with this for a very long time, or maybe another condition that is misdiagnosed as Scabies.) But when you know nothing about Scabies and you come across these forums it is extremely disheartening, and you end up convinced that you will never get rid of it.  By the time I was diagnosed with scabies my legs were absolutely destroyed by the buggers. It started with one itchy bump, which I didn't feel constituted a visit to my doctor, and by the time I came back from camping and was able to make an appt. It had spread rapidly. I was prescribed 5% permethrin which is available behind the counter. I used it exactly as the packaging directed (Only I applied it to my face as well because I'm paranoid) two treatments, one week apart. I cleaned my house thoroughly, washed all sheets and pillows everyday for a week (which is probably overkill) Now you're not going to see improvement right away, in fact it will get worse first. For me it was torture (I feel like most legitimate medical websites don't tell you about the psychological torture that scabies is), the itching was so bad that I hadn't slept for about 5 days and spent most of my time in a cold bath as that was the only thing that have me relief, this is the only time in my life I've experienced legitimate  . Slowly (very slowly) things will get better. It took 6 weeks from my first treatment for my   to go away completely. It's extremely hard to believe the scabies are gone when the itching and bumps last for so long (especially with these forums where people tell you scabies live in your walls and you have to bathe in bleach to get rid of them).  It was a long haul, but they did go away with just the average treatment. There's not alot of info online about Scabies but I believe that it's because it truly is just that easy to get rid of. I'm having trouble getting out all my thoughts in a cohesive manor but what I'm trying to get across is you will be cured. It will be hard to stay positive, but just focus on relieveing your symptoms. Heres my suggestion: Take very cold baths (or showers but I found baths better) followed by: -spraying affected areas with Holista tea tree oil, not because tea tree oil ""kills scabies"" but because the Holista spray has peppermint in it as well which is very soothing -rubbing on Eucerin calming cream This combination fave me relief from itching for 45mins-1hr outside of the bath. Stay positive, and stay off of these forums!  4 likes, 49 replies "

Basically they live inside you and come out and bite and tunnel into the skin, especially on the buttocks, back, thighs...but can go elsewhere. Depending on your immune system  these horrors can cause illness, and in some cases death. You can carry them for years with no symptoms and then something can kick them off. They are hard to formally diagnose, they can hide in the body and  can be hard to eradicate. Should you be diagnosed you close contacts have to be treated.

Scabies,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/not-sure-if-re-infestation--689633,Not sure if re-infestation.,"so here is my situation, about 4 months ago i got infested with scabies, im pretty sure it was from a girl i had a one night stand with, because i noticed her waking up itching in the middle of the night. i didnt think much of it then and she didnt warn me about anything probably because she didnt know it herself that time. anyways, about 6 weeks passed and i started getting the usual symptoms: severe itching at night (mostly in groin area), bumps and scratches here and there. it apeared to get worse by the day. after a week of sleepless nights i contacted my doctor, he immediatly waved me off by saying i should change my shampoo or other products i might be using on my skin. i knew that it probably was something more serious but decided to wait it out a few more days, changing skin products didnt help obviously. by this time i did my own research and found out about scabies, which i discussed with my doctor, he told me it didnt look like scabies but send me to a dermatologist, and surprise, it was scabies.  got a iver/perm cream treatment and a week later did my 2nd perm treatment. he gave me a extra tube of perm just in case, which i used as a 3rd treatment out of paranoia again approx 10 days later. i felt immidiate relief, slept like a baby.  anyways, about 2 months have passed since my last treatment. i have been itchy here and there but nothing like the severe itch we are all famillair with here. i have been getting bumps that come and go, mostly at the exact places. im pretty sure i have dealt with these little b******s. but like most of you know, the worst thing about this disease is the paranoia it causes. every now and then im almost certain im re-infested, and a day later im sure im not, crazy right? ive been seeing what i think are burrows, but might aswell be scratches. im serverly itchy, and most of the itch i get dissapears without me touching it.  my real question is, what if i got re-invested, how much time would it need to go to the fully severe itching that keeps you up at night. i imagine a re-infestation would need some time to spread before it goes berserk on you, so it would start with a light itch going worse by the day. or would it keep you up at night after a couple of days? 0 likes, 2 replies "

Scabies,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/cured-100-real-story-my-story--62190,cured!!!! 100% real story/my story!!!,"This is my story.  I am not completely sure how I got it or if I ever really had it.  I did what some people might have also done, self diagnosed.  If I could go back I would have definitely went to a dermatologist and demanded a skin scrape test, which would hopefully determine what exact skin condition I had.  But I was convinced and still believe I had scabies.   It all started with a small patch of bumps that were on my right forearm.  It was about 2 weeks before Christmas.  I noticed the bumps after they started to itch a little, but didn’t think much of it.  Then it seemed to appear on the other forearm.  Not ever having something like this or even understanding the many possibilities, I just thought it was a simple rash.  About 3 days later while sleeping, I woke up with a severe itchiness on the inside of both my thighs, then during the day it was like it disappeared.  It happened the next day but seemed more severe,  and the only thing that seemed to help was taking a hot bath and letting the water run over my thighs.  Again in the morning it went away.  After that night of basically no sleep and in the bath, I went on webMD and typed in all my symptoms and it came up with scabies as one of the possibilities, especially with the itching and scratching at night.  At this point I was not sure what I should do.  The next night was the same as the two previous nights but seeming to get more intense.  But in the morning I woke up and noticed that it had spread all over my body.  It was all over my arms, but not really on the hands.  It was all over my back, on my chest and stomach, and all over my legs and on my feet.  The weird thing about my lower legs like from the knee down, it that around each hair follicle it seem to have a red circle.  At this point I went to a community urgent care.  When I went they asked what I was there for, I told them a rash and that I thought I might be scabies.  Of course me not knowing the nightmare of a condition it can be, I told them, and of course the treated me as if I had the plague or something.  Knowing what I know now I can not really blame them.  Needless to say they were very unhelpful, one of the nurses told me that simple lice shampoo would take care of the problem.  So I took her advice and went to Rite Aid and bought some and put in all over my body.  Of course as you all probably know, it takes a lot more than simple hair lice product to kill them.  So after a couple days and a couple applications of Rid the head lice treatment with no results I decided to go to a real urgent care affiliated with a hospital.  When I went in and told them what I thought I had, they didn’t treat much different from other patients in the waiting room.  Even the doctor was pretty at ease with sitting in the room and talking with me, or at least it seemed as if he was.  Anyway, he prescribed permitherin.  I put it all over except my face.  The next morning it actually seemed to help a lot. Also washed all my blankets pillows and all dirty clothes in hot water.  And I grabbed my bike and went out for a ride, with scratch scars on my arms and legs, but I was cured.  So I thought.  It only took a couple days to realize that permitherin helped but did not kill or cure all.  I found myself refilling my perscription 7 days later and reapplying it because even the package says it may need second dosage 7 days later.  The second dose still didn’t kill or cure all. I then found myself searching the web and reading and learning as much as I can about this.  At this point I was convinced I had scabies because I even talked to a doctor and he told me if the scabicide worked even a little it only works on parasites and not skin conditions such as follicleitis and others that are commonly confused with scabies.  As the saying goes IGNORANCE IS DEFINITELY BLISS!  The more I read, the more I was horrified.  Ever story of struggle with hardly and happy endings, was discouraging.  I can not tell you how many posts and forum pages I read.  I was determined to beat this. This is what I bought; I bought a plastic drop “cloth” from the dollar store to cover my mattress with.  I would spray and wipe this down every morning with Lysol or some type of disinfectant spray because believe me Lysol gets very expensive after a little while.  I believe I replaced this once a week or so, but only a dollar so not too bad. I bought plastic pillow cover from Wal-Mart I think.  Actually slept without pillow throughout most of this.  I also sprayed and wiped down every morning. I bought plastic gloves from dollar store that I wore almost all day.  Probably was a riot to a lot of people while driving in the streets, but I wanted to make sure I wasn’t letting myself come into contact with any new ones that might be on objects in my car or in my house.  I made sure that to throw these away every time I touched something I thought could possibly have been contaminated.  So needless to say I went through a lot of plastic golves. Always had plastic bags for my laundry, trash(mostly napkins and plastic gloves). I tried to confine myself to my room so I ate out I would say 99.99% of this time.  I would mostly go to McDonalds and get a cheeseburger and a dollar salad. And buy like two of three of these for the day. This was my regimen for many many months; I limited my clothes I wore to 3 sets, and washed clothes every 3 to 4 days. I also limited what I used as blankets at night, 1 sheet.   This is what remedies I have tried; Permitherin about 5 or 6 times.  I took 1 dose that seems to help a lot but not all the way.  Went back a week later and did it one more time.  After that didn’t work I believe I tried it 3 times in a row, which still did not kill all.  I also read online somewhere that they are getting more and more resistant to permitherin.  And if you think about it, it make sense that they are suvivors, they have been around for a long long time. After permitherin didn’t work, I tried vinegar After vinegar didn’t work I tried Neem.  I used the Neem lotion from Henry’s , now Sprout’s. After neem didn’t work, I ordered some pure neem oil from eBay, along with coconut and olive oil. After that didn’t work I decided I was going to try Ivermectin. Ivermectin worked for me.  Luckily I live close to Tijuana, Mexico so I was able to take a trip down there and purchase Ivermectin, or Ivermectina in Spanish.  I bought enough to take 3 weeks in a row.  I did this and was cured, it was not instant, I had a lot of bumps and residuals still poping up from time to time, but this time I knew something was different.  It took a month or two to really stop seeing new bumps form, but I heard it could take a while for all the scabies that died due to ivermectin to come out of skin, and while they are there still they show symptoms of iratation, i.e. rash. Even to this day I get small little bumps pop up, but I pretty sure by taking the permitherin and ivermectin I probably picked up a small case of dermatitis or follicleitis. Please ask any questions, I will try to help as much as possible, Please hang in there and remember things can and will get better! 7 likes, 98 replies "

I thought i had hiv or std and got myself tested all of which came out as negative Thank God!  I was able to see a dermatologist last july13 and she said it was just an irritation and asked me to use a mild collagen soap from her clinic and prescribed citerizine (anti-histamine) 1x a day and to put betamethasone cream on the bumps. 2 weeks into this the rash spread like wildfire and it was red and very itchy, it spread all through out my body except for my neck, shoulders, upper back  and face. When i went back to the dermatologist last july 27 she said it could be scabies and asked me to apply 1 part 5%permethrin 1 part hydrodex lotion from the neck down twice a day without taking a bath for 2 days then stop and bathe for another 2 days then repeat the 2x a day for 2 days application of the creams which i did. My 5yo son who sleeps beside me every night did not get any rashes though so i had a doubt that it was scabies although i continued with the treatment she reccomended.  I threw away my mattress, washed all my pillows, beddings, clothes. I sanitized all surfaces and changed to fresh towels and beddings every day. I was already taking the anti histamine tabs twice a day.  i also started using sulfur soap since july 30 because i read somewhere that it helps. But the rash was still there and its getting worse. I decided to apply only the permethrin 5% last sunday august 4 which would have been my fifth application and took a shower the next day. I asked my mom and son to apply the perm just in case. Monday and tues a take a bath twice a day with the sulfur soap. And just tonight i noticed that the rash on my legs looks dried up and scaly, my thighs and arms still had the bumps. my palms are getting scaly and is flaking off.

Sciatica,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/nerve-decompression-surgery-678943,Nerve Decompression Surgery,"Hi All I am due to have nerve decompression surgery on 2nd October following 10 months of left sided sciatic pain. I am posting on here in the hope that my experiences over the last 10 months may help anyone who is suffering from similar issues.   I am a 56 year old male from the UK. I am now retired but used to be very active doing property renovations, playing golf, walking etc...The injury did not cause my early retirement. I have never suffered from back problems until December 2017 when the day after playing golf I developed a mild lower back pain. The following week i seemed to aggrivate the back issue by moving furniture and following a long drive I developed severe pain in the left buttock. Over the next few days and weeks the pain developed into the back of my left thigh, side of calf, ankle and numbness on top of foot, big toe, and what felt like a lump when walking on bottom of my left foot. After 3 weeks i decided to get private physio treatment. I had 10 sessions over a 2 month period and my condition changed from not being able to sit for short periods and persitant pain to being able to sit on firm chairs for long periods and the most pain being in the morning when getting out of bed. What i did find was that i  was unable to walk more than 50 yards without severe pain in the side of my calf. This seemed to develop after about six weeks from initial injury. In Feb 2018 I decided to see my doctor who suggested  Co-Codamol and Ibuprofen and to carry on with physio. In March 2018 I went to see my doctor again as I thought that although my condition was initially recovering it now seemed to have plateaued. I still had re-occuring calf pain and numbness in my foot and toe. My doctor decided to refer me to an Orthopeadic Consultant who I managed to see private on my spouses work health care cover. I had an MRI that showed stenosis at L4/L5 caused by a disc bulge.  More medication prescribed, Naproxen and Amitriptyline and a root block injection. The root block seemed to be effective for a couple of days then went back to the usual discomfort.  Three months later a second root block, I might also say that the medication seemed to be having little effect, the second root block had no effect whatsoever. I never considered surgery as my consultant always said that I was in recovery but I was starting to feel that wasnt the case. I was starting to feel down and felt it was starting to effect my relationship with my spouse even though she has been very supportive through the whole process. I have recently been getting pins and needles in the left leg ankle pain that wakes me everynight and still have pain in the calf when I walk for more than 50 yards. since December i've tried medication, physio, accupuncture, diet, tens machine but nothing seems to be working. In early September I decided to seek a second opinion from another consultant who was straight forward and up front he said it could recover but it could take time, not just months but years or it may not recover at all. Surgery could speed up any recovery and has a 75% chance of complete sucess. I noted that the sucess rate was the same as the root block injection being effective but realised that the injection was to fix the pain rather than the problem. I decided on the surgery....I am fully aware of what it involves and have read on this site posts from others where surgery was ineffective. I am confident that it will be a success I have to be, as is my consultant. He has said that it is very effective with leg pain but often doesn't  rid of back pain. I have never had back pain apart from the initial first week of the injury.  I have been fortunate in the fact that I am covered with private health care but do  have the costs of each procedure from physio through to root block and surgery for anyone in thr UK thats interested as I know this whole process would take far longer through the NHS system. My only regret at this point is that I didnt have surgery earlier as the last 10 months have been hell and have total sympathy for anyone that is going through similar problems. I do intend to update this thread after surgery.  0 likes, 14 replies "

Chiropractor or Physical Therapy?,"Hi there, for the past 10 years, I would get this periodic pinch ever few months in the back of my thigh. I always thought it was the chair digging into my leg. Now I've learned its some form of Sciatica. I've been seeing 2 Chiropractors for the last 2 months. One seemed to make it worse due to being too aggressive, the other seemed to make it better by being less aggressive and doing other moves like reseting the bone. So yes it has gotten worse but the first chiro didn't help and I was still doing things that weren't helping like stretching my hamstrings. So now I'm at a point where the new chiro does does help it for a few days but it never holds and will act up again. I am wondering if there is something else I should be doing at home like certain safe stretches or exercises. And does this defiantly sounds like a disc issue or could it be my Piriformis Muscle and if I Should see a physical therapist instead? Sitting for a few minutes  acts it up. Laying down is ok. Its never painful. Just numbness or a light pinch. Sometimes i moves from my back thigh to my hip. I can't take an MRI because I have   and a MRI is too loud. It will worsen my Tinnitus to dangerous levels. So the doctors are kinda in the dark. Is there another non-radiation method for seeing the discs? I hope there is someone here that has similar symptoms and can share what helped them. I really don't want to do surgery. Walking helps the most. The more I walk, the better I feel.

I had a MRI and the doctors told me I had a pretty bad herniated disk. I took the shot in my back about 5weeks ago because the pain was so horrible. I couldnt walk, eat or take care of my children. I had to quit my job because I couldnt lift, bend. The shot worked, my pain decreased about 70%. I still had numbness but aleast I could take care of my children. Oh, and I stopped every medication,  muscle relaxer the doctors prescribed to me. Not that it ever worked for me. Anyway,  I had a few deep tissue massages after the shot to help loosen the muscles in my leg. It helped somewhat. Now, the pain is back. I have to take Advil 400 mg every four to five hours to perform everyday tasks. I cant sleep more than four hours because I wake up in horrible pain. Then I have to lay in bed in pain crying out until the medication works about a hour later. When I get out of bed in the morning I scream out in pain. I'm just really worried of my kids constantly seeing me in pain or crying. I'm loosing hope! I have an appointment for another injection this Friday. But I dont want to depend on those for the rest of my life and I know all this advil is dangerous. SORRY for the long rant, but my family doesnt understand how painful sciatica is and Im feeling depressed. Please help!

I'd like to apologize in advance since I don't remember the details precisely to every  detail, but I hope this will help some of you in your quest to recovering as I did. Well first, I'd like to tell my personal experience with sciatica and how it ruined most of my young adult life: I first encountered sciatica 5 years ago when I was an Apple Care tech support for Apple. You know the person who sits behind a desk for nearly 8-10 hours daily helping clients with their technical issues. I loved the job and I enjoyed helping people, though one morning after moving my furniture around the house the night before, the next morning I could not stand up. I usually never cried to pain, but I had no choice. For 3 days, after I called in sick, I never moved from my bed. At first thoughts, I knew that maybe I pushed myself but that was impossible, I didn't feel weak at all. However, to keep the story short, I went to the hospital, they made a few tests with me, they confirmed it was not my spine. So being happy that the spine wasn't the problem, they gave me some morpheme and a shot of cortisone and told me I should be back to work in no time. However, that was not the case. I spent the entire week on my 4 feet. Going to the bathroom was like sitting on a nail and felt like my butt/leg was going to rip off. It was a nightmare. The week passed, and I unfortunately quit my job. Luckily or coincidentally, I got called to an even better company (bonuses, pay, the works) and this involved me to move around much more. So I thought, because standing did not hurt me in anyway, I thought maybe this job would help stretch out the legs and take away the pain. Long story short, every morning as I put on my boots to go to work, my morning was a ritual of horror. It was take a deep breath, hold it, and put my socks on. The pain never left, it only gradually faded, but rushed right back as I did anything like bending down, going to the bathroom, forcing on the toilet also hurt me quite a bit, taking a shower was nearly an impossible feat, etc. So as I got the position, I was working for a few months, the same thing happened the very first time it did when I went to the hospital, this time, I collapsed. I was already use to the pain by now that this was normal for me, in a way anyway but i managed to crawl to the phone and asked for the day off because I could no longer feel my left leg. I went to the doctor the week after and asked for a checkup, my doctor told me I had sciatica and a herniated disc that needed scanning for more confirmation. So I did. I went to the hospital prior to meeting my doctor, and yes, they found a small herniation between my L4-L5 vertabrae, but everything else was normal. My doctor informed me that it was time to quit and find a job like the one I had before, just that I was in no position to going back after quitting and sitting would definitely not help me. He prescribed me acetaminophen , naproxen, and aleve for the duration of about 2 years. (I mean I took them for roughly 2 years) He also told me to visit the physiotherapists to help exercise the muscle. At first of course the muscles hurt but the pain/sting never really left. I spent nearly 6ooo$ on physio and it only made me feel stronger but didn't remove the stinging/stabbing/sudden pain. I did physio for 6 months and nothing helped. Eventually my doctor wanted to prescribe me blood thinners, but I rejected them. Something was bugging me that there was something more. I asked to get an echography, to verify the muscle, but he rejected it instantly. After every 2 weeks of visiting my doctor for the last few years, I knew I had to see a specialist or someone. As a ray of hope, my mom found out about a chiropractor, not far from where my doctor was located and decided to make an appointment. He examined me and after nearly being there for about 1 hour, he told me to see a specialist nurse who could free some space for my nerve or a specialist in the spinal and nerve anatomy. First of course I went to see the nurse, she did in fact make me feel the burn as it felt as if she drilled her thumb to where my nerve was from buttock to ankle. I felt bruised, however the pain never subsided. I quit seeing her. Then after trying to wait for some kind of income, since I was already in debt from physio, I checked out the specialist. It didn't cost that much for a diagnostic but we after careful examination and verifying my spine fully, from the cervical to the lumbar, we realized the spine was leaning to my right. For fun, I asked to get an echography from him and he saw that my nerve was pressed upon my leg muscles. (from psoas to the IT band and etc) As I bent my leg up and down, the nerve rubbed. But funny enough, when my leg bent upwards, it did not hurt. He continued to say that my spine along with my leg muscles/nerve was twisted as well. He also told me to do a specific exercise that would help strengthen my nerve and that was to push from my feet up onto my toes and then go back down. Standing up of course. I don't have an image for it so to keep it simply, imagine trying to reach for the sky and you push with your feet up until you are on your toes. That was the exercise.  But in the end, with the tilt I had, he proceeded to saying that I should get a lift for one of my shoes so that my spine could realign. After the visit, I went to buy the lift but it didn't help me anymore than I thought it could. Keep in mind that during the time I spent exercising, I was drinking lots of powerade and eating lots of salads and healthy foods so I wouldn't become overweight, I thought the boost of vitamins would help since I noticed after taking 2 years of pills, I stopped for 2 reasons. First, because I knew it was not helping whatsoever, and the second because I started having really dry skin on my feet, that never happened before. Anyway back to my story, I went to see the chiropractor since we really had no idea what was going on, but this time I explained to him the degree of my pain and what was wrong with my spine, he managed to place it back and it helped a whole lot, but the occasional pain was still there.  Before I left to go home, he told me to not wear the lift anymore, to prevent realigning the spine back to it's original ""poor"" posture. Anywho, this is how I found my true calling, not going to lie, the chiropractor and the specialist did help a whole lot. And I thank them for the realignment. I AM IN NO WAY A PROFESSIONAL SO PLEASE DO NOT CONTINUE IF THE PAIN WORSENS PLEASE. I know how hell feels like, i've been there and done that. So first, seek a healthcare professional and check if your spine needs aligning (preferably scan the entire spine top side down and to see if it is not curved from left to right) Secondly, once the spine, if possible is aligned correctly, start taking vitamin b12 supplements with Omega 3 fish oil pills, they will help boost your bodies scarce supply after taking so many antibiotics you're body needs to be able to recover. Now, here is the more interesting part, I noticed that my bed could be the problem when in fact it was not. And believe me I tried everything, pillow between knees, neck, leaving the leg up etc. But I thought to myself, what happens when someone strains their ankle or arm? They keep it bent and close, most of the time right? So I tried it. So I would lay down on the side that did not hurt of course (I really don't know how to help if both sides hurt, but to me I would think that would be a very rare occasion and believe me, I've been researching this problem for 5 years, I know what I am kinda doing, but I am no professional) and I would bend below my knee and bring it up to my bum, kinda like if I were to sit at a japanese table. But In this form, lay sideways with the knee bent back and place a pillow or cushion between your bed and waist (stomach side), your knee that is suspended over your other leg (if youre right leg hurts, lay on your left left and bend the right leg to your bum and same goes with the opposite) and something under your neck to keep it straight. Now, I have had a hard time trying to keep my knee bent under my bum for longer than an hour so I just try to lean towards a wall and hold it there. You want to try to pull it as far back as you can to your bum, sideways and laying down of course. It's hard to hold longer than an hour for me, maybe it will be different for you. But after 1 night sleep with my knee bent back and my dog helping me,  😛 , I felt like the pain just went away the next day. For the fun of it I tried putting my socks on, it stung very gently but of course I didn't want to test my strength just yet. So instead of pushing myself, like I always loved doing, I slept with my left leg tug as close to my butt and held it there. And that's it really. I hope that this will help many patients out there that you can in fact cure this SOB, pardon my french, and get on with your life. I finally can bend and put my socks on and it feels amazing. For those wondering how long I've been doing this for, I've done it for about 1 week. What equipment to I have at home, I have an inversion table, an exercise/walking machine, exercise balls, you name it, I tried it. But ultimately, if you are still in bed with that pain and cannot move, my personal recommendation would be to make sure you have no inflammation, and if you don't to stop taking Antibiotics and take vitamin B complex pills/ supplements. Yes, don't be afraid that your urine will change color, it's only natural. In my opinion, you cannot really get OD on these but for those wondering how I did it. For the first week I took 3 Vitamin B pills (I weigh roughly 240lbs) and after that I went down to 2 for the next week, and then 1 every day to recover. I only recently found that this really helped and I no longer feel the side-effects of sciatica, I am so happy, you have no idea. Cheers to everyone, and I wish the best for you're future endeavors! 0 likes, 3 replies "

The letter states if i still have leg pains either bilateral or the right worse than the left then they would suggest surgery in the form of a bilateral L5/S1 lateral recess decompression. I have great improvement in my left leg  about 70% better and slight improvement in my right leg pain. So i am wondering what i should do as i have to let them know if i want surgery within 2 weeks of receiving this letter. Where i am now some 8 months from when it started , I still have pain all day but, it is better than it was but, i still take naproxen, amitriptyline with the occassional  tramadol. I still have to lay on the floor each evening as this helps to relieve the pain, i cannot   or sneeze without pain shooting down my right leg nor can i sit for long or put my socks on  normally. I still cannot bend forward and my social life has been none existant as i have to lay down in an evening. I have managed to continue to work all the time since it began (i really do not know how i have managed to do this tbh) and can drive very short distances with pain but, i no longer cry every day nor want to cut my leg off due to the pain anymore.
