Hypothyroidism,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/neck-pressure-and-thyroid-symptoms-but-labs-normal-283992,neck pressure and thyroid symptoms but labs normal,"I visited the doctors 4 weeks ago with neck pressure, at the time only left sided. It feels like someone is pushing on the side of my neck. This is now happening to both sides of my neck. If i press on the area of discomfortt it makes the pressure worse. My GP ordered bloods for thyroid function which all came back normal. He also requested a scan which I am still awaiting an appointment for. I have also had an almost constant headache in my forehead for nearly 5 weeks that is controllable with painkillers. Over the last 2 or 3 years I have visited my GP surgery for:  palpitations - bloods, ecg, echo all came back normal nail ridges - tested for anameia, normal but odd results, one at top range, other bottom, GP requested more tests, all came back normal Stomach bloating and weight gain - all tests normal The weight gain could be that I quit smoking (<5 a day) 4 years ago. The bloating I put down to IBS in the end. The nail ridges still there. Both my big toe nails actually broke in half last year. Only things I could think to blame were my vegetarian diet and nail dryness. All the above, I read, fits with hypothyroidism. Feeling frustrated that all my results always come back normal and feel like I'm constantly wasting both mine and the NHS's time. Has anyone else experienced this, or does anyone else have any idea of other causes?  My GP has said if the neck pressure continues (this comes and goes btw) to go back in a week or 2 and he will refer me to a specialist but I can't help but think that again everything will be normal and I may as well just accept that I'm 40 in a couple of weeks and perhaps this is just how it feels to be middle aged.  0 likes, 26 replies "

Hypertension,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/blood-pressure-spikes-concern--692895,Blood Pressure Spikes Concern!?,"Hi guys, I'm not sure if this is in the right section to post this but it does pertain to blood pressure.  Also sorry for the lengthy post in advance. 2 years ago I was diagnosed with panic disorder and generalized anxiety. Sometime last year I had two really bad panic attacks which I called the paramedics for. The took my vitals and my blood pressure was 172/128 the first time and 180/124 the second panic attack. I had another one recently which shot my blood pressure up to 172/117.  When I got to the hospital, my blood pressure had dropped to about 135-140/85-90. This frightened me so I decided to buy a blood pressure machine which isn't smart for someone with anxiety but I needed to know if my blood pressure spiked on other occasions. One night I had a panic attack that woke me from my sleep, I immediately got up and took my blood pressure and it was 205/115. 5 minutes later 150/90. Then eventually went back to 120/79. This part is a bit personal and a little embarrassing, but I was curious about blood pressure during certain activities like self pleasure. So, each time I engage in self pleasure I take my blood pressure in the arm that I am not using and each time my blood pressure spikes upward 170-182/120-130. This can't be normal. I brought up this issue with my doctor who just brushed it off as anxiety. He says I am too young, (28) and in shape to be worried about blood pressure because every time he takes it, it's normal. He says of course your blood pressure is going to spike with anxiety + activity. However from what I read, your diastolic shouldn't change much and mine spikes along with my systolic to extreme numbers. I guess my question to you guys is, do you agree with my doctor or should I look into seeing another doctor about these concerns? Does anyone else experience these kind of spikes? What could be causing this high of a spike? 0 likes, 6 replies "

I have had a resting heart rate of 100-110 for a long time, but it never caused me any issues. BP was always low normal-120/70, no shortness of breath, no exercise intolerance. After heavy periods, I ended up with anemia which caused shortness of breath that still persists (nearly 5 months later). My BP suddenly went up to 108 diastolic (systolic didn't go above 135 or so), was accompanied with flushed skin, shortness of breath, severe   and chest discomfort. I was initially put on HCTZ, which didn't help. I saw a cardiologist who suspects my BP spiked from the tachycardia (weird as that hasn't happened in all these years..but very possible). He put me on 2.5 mg of Bisoprolol twice  a day, starting with once a day and going up if HR is still above 90. The 2.5 mg brought my heart rate down to 70 and my diastolic down between 77-84 (which is still a bit higher than it used to be before the spike). I am not taking the 5 mg as it lowered my heart rate to 50, and I am not very comfortable with that plus from what I am reading it's a hard medicine to wean off (something I'd like to do eventually, under medical supervision of course) so if I am doing well on a lower dose, I'd keep it that way, I would love to hear from anyone who can relate to this or has any thoughts/experiences to share. 0 likes, 10 replies "

Roughly 5 weeks ago, my 2 year 4 month old boy started acting very lethargic and just overall weird.  After four trips to the hospital / clinic, the doctors finally identified that his blood pressure was dangerously high, like 145/100.   They admitted us to the hospital and then ICU and slowly brought his blood pressure back under control with Labetelol and Norvasc. Since then, we have been searching for a cause (and solution) with no luck, and we're running out of things to look at.   We have, at times, suspected a pheochromocytoma, renal artery stenosis, seizures, heart problems, and more, and, essentially, the doctors are running out of things to look for.   I can provide more detail if desired, but here are some of the things we've done: I'm sure there's more that I'm missing, but the doctors have essentially exhausted their testing.  He's on 2.2 milligrams of amlodapine (Norvasc) twice daily and it more-or-less keeps his blood pressure below 110/xx, but we have been having to add in the Labetelol recently on an as-needed basis to keep it below 120/xx.

I am a 44 year old female who has had chronic high blood pressure since I was in college.  Seems to just be bad genes, as I've been through every test imaginable and the doctors have never discovered a 'reason' for it (no kidney issues, etc).  For as long as I can remember, my blood pressure was controlled quite well on Coreg CR, 40 mg.  In the last year or so (I think in relationship to perimenopause) it has steadily increased and I am working closely with my doctor to tweak my treatment and find a medication/combination that works well.  I am currently taking hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg), Lisinopril (5 mg) and Coreg (40 mg).  The doctor had me try cutting out the Coreg to see what would happen, and although my BP didn't get   high, my pulse became quite fast, even at rest.  So, the doctor is now having me try 20 mg Coreg along with the other 2 meds.  I guess my question is (and I'll discuss this with my doctor, too) is - how can I get this back down to just 1 or 2 meds?  Having to take 3 pills every morning seems, to me, to be quite a lot.  Is 3 meds a 'standard' treatment for HBP?  I know combinations are often beneficial over a single med, but, I guess, just ugh.  3 meds.  Any insight would be appreciated.

I started having hyper symptoms back in February 2018, it took 6 weeks for any GP to refer me back to the hospital consultant (they didn’t believe I had the correct symptoms). I have been back to the thyroid consultant today and he has said that my thyroid levels are now in range. He’s said as this is the second time I’ve had it, I have more of a chance of going hyper again if I come off carbimazole so he is going to gradually lower the dosage from what it is now (20mg) to 5mg and be kept on that until my son is old enough so that I can have the RAI. My son is 5 and he said I could have the RAI a when he is 8!!! I did ask if there was a possibility I could just eventually come off carbimazole without further treatment. Do I wait? Should I consider asking him for a thyroidectomy? Do I change my diet to see if this makes a difference? I have also had problems with my liver due to a mix of high carbimazole dose and a infection. I see the consultant in 2 months so I have some time to consider what I’d like to ask him next. What would you do in my situation? What experiences have you had?

I'm in dire need of emotional support as I thought this stuff was all behind me.  Saw Endo  this Monday. He's not concerned and said it's a combo of infection/dye and nodule.

Hypothyroidism,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/overmedicated-on-synthroid--681385,Overmedicated on Synthroid?,"Hi all, I've already read quite a bit on this topic in other discussions here but I just wanted to share my recent experience and maybe guess get some reassurance? I was first diagnosed with hypothyroidism when I was about 20 or 21. My pcp diagnosed me, and at the time he didn't do any further testing to see why I was hypo. I just started Synthroid and that was that. I didn't have any issues with it for years, I was on a pretty low dose as my levels were kind of borderline. Flash forward a few years, I moved to Houston and saw an endocrinologist. He tested me for Hashimotos, which was negative, and just told me to keep taking the Synthroid and chalked it up to genetics. Then another year or so later I saw another endo that was closer to my house (the first guy was way downtown, over an hour drive) and she took a look at my current and previous labs and thought I didn't need to be on Synthroid any longer. Which was weird, because I was going to ask her if we should increase my dosage, as I'd done some research and felt my levels were still kind of high even though they were technically considered within normal limits. I don't exactly remember her reasoning, she said something about it being likely that my levels were only hypo when I was first diagnosed because of a virus or something as they were borderline. So I listened to her and stopped taking it, all seemed fine. I'd say this was about 2 years or so ago.  Then earlier this year in March, I started feeling super lethargic and gained about 10 pounds out of nowhere. No change in my diet or exercise, and it seemed that I'd gained it in literally like a few weeks. That was the only 'symptom' I'd had when I was first diagnosed, so I asked a PA that I work with (I work in a doctors office) to just order some labs to see. My TSH was high, she recommended I see my PCP. So I go, and I guess the PA didn't order a full panel, only checked TSH, so my PCP was reluctant to start me on Synthroid but agreed because I'd had the weight gain and fatigue. She started me on 50 mcg (pretty sure I used to take 25, but it may have been increased to 50 at one point during the years).  So now for the present...about a month ago I started noticing I was just feeling off. I couldn't quite explain to people what was wrong, but I was just feeling very jittery and anxious and like I wanted to vibrate out of my skin. I was also noticing heart palpitations and intermittent pains all over my torso, chest, ribs, collarbone area. it was weird. So being me, I googled it and naturally freaked myself out enough about all the worst case scenarios, and went to an urgent care. While I was there, they did an EKG and listened to my heart, etc. The only thing out of whack was my blood pressure was high. I also have white coat syndrome so I figured that was why. I remembered while I was there that these symptoms could be a result of my Synthroid, so I mentioned it and they ordered labs. It came back a couple days later that my T4 was elevated, though everything else was within normal limits. (T4 was at 14, normal limits per the results are 5.1 - 11.9) So I went to my PCP (who I haven't been crazy about honestly, I was going to look for a new one next time I needed a physical). I told her what had been going on, and she's looking at my bloodwork and somehow missed the elevated T4 even though that was the reason the urgent care told me to follow up with her. I had to point out to her that it was elevated. I had already stopped taking the Synthroid, and she agreed that I should not take it and recheck levels in 6 weeks. So, even though she's not my favorite doctor, she was clearly right about not wanting to put me on Synthroid again so quickly last time.  Anyway, in the meantime she also noticed my blood pressure was high and asked me to monitor it. I did, and it was consistently high for about a week and a half, so I decided to see a cardiologist just to be sure everything was okay. we discussed my BP and I told her about the palpitations etc., she initially said she wanted to get me on medication for my BP until I could lose some weight and hopefully stop taking it. In the meantime she did a 24 hour heart monitor and echocardiogram. Both came back okay, she could see the palpitations on the monitor but said they were benign. By my follow up visit, my BP had pretty much normalized. I still sometimes have higher readings, but they aren't as high as they were and for the most part its back to normal thankfully so I didn't need to start meds.  LONG POST SHORT...it's now officially beginning of week 5 since I stopped synthroid and I am still feeling ill. Not nearly as bad as I was, but I'm still having palpitations and elevated heart rate. Elevated enough that I have to be sure and monitor it closely while exercising so I don't overdo it. And the anxiety is still there in a big way. I already have some issues with anxiety and this has just tripled it, and then monitoring things like my heart rate make me anxious when it's high, so it's just a never ending vicious circle. it doesn't seem that my T4 was horrifically elevated, has anyone else experienced these kind of symptoms with T4 only being a little high? I think I've read it takes 6-8 weeks for your thyroid to level out after changing your dosage/stopping, but some say it can take months, anyone have any personal experience?  Sorry for the crazy long post, I kind of just wanted to write down all that's been going on for my own therapeutic reasons as well as get any kind of advice or to commiserate with anyone who's had the same! Oh and for the record, I'm a 28 year old female. Thanks to anyone who read this far! <3   0 likes, 9 replies "

I was born with the fat starting from my knees up and my elbows up.  I have no upper arm strength, so hanging curtains is a nightmare. I never sweat and if my temp is 37 deg celcius, I am sick. Over 9 days in hosptal for my rare neuro condition - IHH, it was mostly 35, 36 three times and once 37. The ward doctor simply did not believe it! I am desperate for any kind of lead, thyroid doctor, panel, or other way of finding out what tests I need to have done. Thank you folks. Praying for a miracle here. 0 likes, 8 replies "

I saw another dr the next morning who told me to stop taking them and put it all down to anxiety - heart still racing. Fast forward to the next week (wb 25.03.19) and my heart was still racing - it wasn't above 120bpm but was faster than usual and made me feel uncomfortable. I saw a different GP and he said I was highly anxious and prescribed anti-depressants. I asked for bloods to be done to check my thyroid. Low and behold, my TSH was 0.05 and FT4 was 33. Saw a different GP a few days later who told me to stop taking levo and to not take any more anti-depressant. I've not had levo now for 12 days and I am absolutely exhausted. I've read about Hashimoto flare ups and assumed it was one of these that had caused me to be over medicated but someone has since mentioned that perhaps my auto immune disease is graves instead.

My back hurts again, it's been on and off since the last time i saw a doctor in November. The pain and discomfort is around the lower back in and around the spine and hip area. I also get back pain when I lie down in bed, I elevate my head because of acid reflux. My back feels sensitive to the matress, which is a bit hard in the middle, possibly a spring.... even if I put a pillow on it or sit on a sofa or chair. Its a feeling that's hard to explain, sort of numb and uncomfortable. I try back exercises I seen on YouTube and yoga, they help temporarily. Carrying something heavy and throwing it hurts my back. When I move my leg towards my head, I feel my lower back click. Sitting on the sofa brings in some pain to my lower back, even with a footrest. When doing something like hoovering, my back feels numb, like tight. I get a weird tingling feeling down my leg and feet, like  my brain is focusing on it. (Hard to explain, even to the doc.) Also causes tension headaches and sort of pressure in my head behind the nose. I had a check up before, he did a physical examination of my leg and arm and said they are absolutely fine. Said my back is fine, just the muscles are tight, and recommended I drink lots of water and swiggle my shoulders if I start feeling stiff in the back. He also thought anxiety and stress maybe contributing to it. I am managing my anxiety. I still get problems when I'm mentally ok. He thought that work like painting maybe making my arms and shoulders feel tired. I haven't done any of that lately. I tried tying a knot today, it was causing tension in my back and head....couldn't do it. He said that a young man like me shouldn't need to worry much about it... But it is starting to annoy me.

No pain was experienced while standing or laying down. I went to a doctor who felt around for any   and then did a blood test for inflammation. The blood test came back clear so I accepted the pain and started to move on. I felt like it was finally getting better, until about 5 days ago when I was sitting on the floor and got up suddenly, I seem to have moved the wrong way and I felt something tear/split in my lower left back. Seconds later, I got a shooting pain down my entire left leg  and had to go and sit down. Sitting down for any longer than a few minutes is almost unbearable at the moment, I can't bend over from a seated position to put on shoes and I am experiencing a lot of pain radiating to my left hip area.

Backache,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/backpain-for-about-6-months-and-begining-to-lose-hope-693982,"Backpain for about 6 months, and begining to lose hope","I am from Denmark and I have been living with back pain for the last 6 months. I have tried a lot of treatments with No luck and I am staring to lose hope for a fix. Before this i never had Any back related problems at All. I never took  , and All in All I was very rarely sick. But 2018 was a tuning point. I was sick several times, and had a lot of health related problems, especially regarding my back. First off, i want to describe how my back pain behaves. The pain shifts around My upper back, in a lot of different ways. It can go to My shoulder blades, mid back and My sides/ribs. Furthermore the pain can be really severe or it can be there without disrupting My daily life. I found that one of the weirdest things about My back pain is that it can be there 3 days in a row and then disappear for a week or i can have it for a week with intense pain. As you can see, the pain changes a lot. Another weird thing, is that it sometimes helps to lie down for a period, while it other times ends up making the pain worse. The same is true about small walks, sometimes it can be good for My back, and other times it makes it Hurt even more. My story: It all started the summer of 2018. I was at a festival with My firends that lasted about a week. One of the last nights of the festival, i had a severe incident. Everytime i took a step it felt like i got stabbed in the back, the same happened when i took a half deep breath. The following night i had the worst upper back pain i have ever experienced in My life. After the festival i had a decent week. I spent most of the week at home, relaxing after along festival. I had a few back related problems along the week, but not anything severe. At the end of this week i went to Amsterdam with My Mother. This week, made me realize that i had developed a persistent problem with My back. Most of the trip i had to sit down every hour and had a lot of pain. I Even threw up once, because of the pain. Before this back pain, i never took any painkillers, but during this week i took several whenever i could. This week was a long one, and filled with pain. As soon as I came back from this trip, i went to a physiotherapist. After just one session, i felt way better and I actually thought the problem was over, but just 2 weeks later, it came back. Every session with My physiotherapist the next Two months only helped very little. My doctor told me, that All hr could do, was to scan me. He also told me that the scan would likely just be a waste. So i ended up contacting an osteopath. He was extremely helpful at first, and He was insanely skilled. The first Two sessions was very helpful, however when i went a third time, it again did very little to help. As I wanted a second opinion on the matter, i contacted a New physiotherapist. He recommended that i should do some specific exercises to strengthen My back. So i did that for about a month, with No results whatsoever. And that laves me here. My pain is getting worse Day by Day, and I have No idea what to do next. I feel lost, because No one can tell me what is wrong. I have though about the fact that My pain might be completely caused by My brain. If that in fact is possible, how do I even begin to treat it? 0 likes, 11 replies "

Most of my life it has been manageable but with the odd nasty flare up every 18 months or so. Whenever I have seen a doctor they always tell me to see an osteopath and treat me like it is a slight twinge I woke up with that morning.  They have shown absolutely no interest.  Now I am a lot older I am just told it's old age.  I have never even had an x-ray done as they said 'It won't show anything'.  Well I have a private one done 20 years ago which showed 1 disc had worn away and another was going. I was referred to physio on the NHS and am doing the exercises but it doesn't seem to help much and have been in chronic constant pain for the last 2 years.  It's just getting worse and worse.  It's so bad now I am contemplating getting a stick or even a walker. They told me it's manual.  My doctor will only prescribe 15 mgs of co-codamol and even doubling up doesn't touch the pain.  Nor does paracetomol or any over the counter meds. I am not in pain usually when sitting but as soon as I stand up it starts.  I end up walking a few yards before having to stop and the more I walk the worse the pain gets.  I still do walk as I know this is good but am getting increasingly isolated at home coz I can't keep up with my friends. I have other health problems too such as mild lung disease, depression, and a borderline under active thyroid and the accumulation of them is making me a prisoner in my own home.  I can do little housework and my home is a complete mess.  I have no family to help me and friends aren't interested. I have very little money as can't work and I don't get my state pension yet.  Can anyone advise me how to get the doctor to take me seriously please, and what more I can do to help myself.  I am well overweight and am trying to lose some but with my thyroid problems and lack of exercise am finding it virtually impossible. Any advice would be appreciated please.

I couldn't have any treatment while I was pregnant so they kept taking smears to keep it in check...the last one (2 weeks before my due date) showed that it had progressed into a 3mm tumor but still I couldn't have anything done until 8 weeks post baby. They cut away the tumor via Lletz but came back that it was still touching the edges so had to have another. Then got all clear and has been since! In July this year I started experiencing faintness/dizzyness and tiredness to an extreme level, doctor sent me for a blood test which came back that I was severely anemic 9.1. I have had a bowel cancer, stomach cancer check, ct scan and ultrasound but with no answers. They reffered me back to gynae. I went to see my consultant 3 days ago and he went through everything I'm experiencing (heavy bleeding, painful periods and obviously anemia) he tried to do a smear but it was far too painful for me due to my scar tissue and inflammation. He said my only option would be an urgent hysterectomy and booked me in for 3 weeks time but before then I would need a blood transfusion, iron infusion, MRI and womb examination. I'm in total shock... I'm only 33 but have 3 children and my family is complete. I have been to see my local gp today to try and make sense of it all and he gave me some other options that involve general anesthetic also but when I asked does it normally happen this fast his answer was ""No"".

I am 34 years old and on day 15 of recovery.  I felt great 3 days after surgery and no longer needed to take any pain meds.  I had been using a stool softener since the first day of surgery.  I was constipated but finally got some relief on day 5.  On day 10 started experiencing some pressure in my bladder and when I peed it still felt like there was urine in my bladder.  both my doctor and I assumed it was a bladder infection.  the test came back negative but my doctor just wanted to do a quick pelvic exam. blood work and found nothing.  she also did an ultrasound to make sure I didn't have any fluid built up, nothing.  the pressure started to subside but on day 13 I all of the sudden started bleeding.  and it was not just a little blood I am talking gushing massive clot bleeding.   luckily im only a 5 minute car ride from the hospital.  I received a blood transfusion within 15-20 minutes of arriving at the ER and was in surgery by an hour.  it turned out that some of the stitches came out of the vaginal cuff.  unfortunately where the stitches came out was near an artery that was just pumping out blood.   they went in vaginally and stitched back up the cuff and they say im good to go.  however I am now scared to sneeze or cough.  I feel like i.might have made the worse decision of my life.  I very easily could have died.  I know that's a risk with any surgery but I just want to warn others that are thinking about doing a lap hysterectomy to ask your doctor if it is the right choice.  there is a less then 1% chance of what happened to me happening. but now I wish I would have asked more questions like is it necessary to remove the cervix(you dont have to have a cuff if the cervix stays)  why cant the procedure be done vaginally vs laproscopic.  there is even less chance of the cuff opening if the procedure is done vaginally.  I was a very active person before this surgery but now I dont know if I will ever be able to workout the way I use to even if the dr tells me it's fine.  the cuff could tear anytime even years after the surgery.  I know I will need to seek help to get past this paranoia and  .   sorry to scare anyone I know what happened to me is really rare and I know tons of people that are beyond happy with their hysterectomy hopefully someday I will feel that way too. 0 likes, 8 replies "

I am done having children so thats not a concern but the side effects and potential complications of other diseases is. I would be happy to wait for the natural menopause or for a closer age to it but the Dr has told me that this could cause complications down the line due to the endo becoming a lot worse and making it far more complicated to excise. He is an Endo specialist and one of the best in the country i believe so I trust his knowledge. He has said I would be on HRT afterwards.

I'm now nearly 3 years post op(3 years in june). I had my partial   (womb cervix tubes but my ovaries are still in though) when I was 24 , I am now 27. I had to hysterectomy due to well honestly we don't know. I started having a period and then never came off it, doctors tried every avenue to try to stop the bleeding. baring in mind that this wasn't just a bit of spotting or a normal period . I can only compare it to something putting on a tap and leaving it running. I had in total 11 ultrasounds 8 internal scans 2 fertility checks 6  and no one could understand why it was it happening.everything was seemingly normal in the aspect of bloods and hormone levels and no thickening of the womb lining. again doctors tried all possible treatments all contraception delay pills. injections scraps . everything and nothing worked and this whole process spanned over 2 years. it got time to seriously consider the hysterectomy, nothing was working and my quality of life was well non existent. they asked if I would prefer to try to oblation first. which I denied due to oblation could work or it could not the hysterectomy however we knew would work, can't bleed from my womb if it's not there. anyway I had the hysterectomy through the key hole procedure.  the recovery for me to be completely okay to work was in total 3.5 months (my job is very active and alot of lifting so took more time) I had no issues with pain was fine with just simple paracetamol for the first 3 weeks then nothing after that. I had no complications. My external incisions healed very quickly around 4 weeks or so. internal obviously  took more time. which brings me to present day I am fully healed My scaring is so tiny if you didn't know I had the operation you wouldn't be able to tell unless you looked realy close. I am period free, after 2 years of being on my period every single day . I have now not had anything since the day of my operation. I don't lie the first treat I bought myself after I had the operation and went back to work was 2 pairs of Crystal white underwear and I felt like a goodness 😂😂😂 I had earned those white pants. we now understand what was happening. when the egg releases from the ovaries  and should wait to be fertilised then reject when it's time to. My body was recognising the release of the egg as a bad thing so anti bodies were destroying it before it could do anything. Why? we don't know that still but at least we know how now. I am obviously unable to have children but I did get a dog and she has happily taken the place of the most important thing in my life.

Then, my appetitite for sweets and junk waned, which is positive. My skin felt better; softer and not dry.  The vaginal dryness and irritation went away, after about 10 years of suffering. There was better circulation  there which means better experiences. I am not sure sensitive nipples is that positive, since I don't get to choose when or how long they are sensitive. I am having better sleep cycles.  But, my hair has been falling out more, which could be age, Im 59.  The women and men in my family do not and did not suffer hair loss... neither do 8 aunts 7  uncles or either parent.  Lots of healthy bushy heads in my family.  I have 3 older sisters and 4 brothers. The worst side effect is the emotional swings coupled with diarreah... Every couple of weeks I have about 36 hours of emotional episode... nervous, anxious, angry... basically nuts.  I don't know how this stuff is designed to deliver which hormone in whatever quantities but it would seem to me that I may be getting too much testosterone?  I can do without the emotional trauma at my age. It's like I'm experiencing the first part of PMS and I hated it then too.  I take 30mg cymbalta  and have for abt 15 yrs. 60 mg full dose gives me those nasty brain zaps and also can make me nervous so that's why the half dose works better for me. Another side effect is blurry vision that comes for a while then clears up.  Annoying if you are an artist or want to read or do any other hobby that requires good vision... or taking a trip out of state going thru 3 major cities during horrible stormy weather.  Yes, I did that. Had to stop for the gut rot too.  Whine, whine and more whine but these can be serious symptoms, especially if you don't have a stable, understanding husband like I do. These emotions will even drive you to leave such a relationship without ANY grounds or reason whatsoever.  You are upset and strung out but have no control.  This being said... One should really consider the mess that one could get into with the side effects and take precautions. My checkup and consultation is coming up and I hope these issues are addressed... because the positive effects of HRT is worth a little inconvenience but NOT my marriage. 0 likes, 6 replies "

Herpes - Non Genital,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/lysine-for-coldsores-124186,Lysine for Coldsores,"I don't know if anyone will find this useful, but for around the last 3 years of my life, I had been getting coldsores monthly, sometimes twice a month.  I've always had coldsores for as long as I can remember, but I was beginning to get them more and more often, and although it sounds dramatic, it was really affecting me. I would be waiting for one to clear and as soon as it had nearly gone a new one would appear. I ended up in a cycle of worrying about coldsores which I believe may have brought them on, but because they would then happen it would just make me worry more.  I became very paranoid and irritable and irrational, I went to the doctor and had blood tests to try and find out why I was getting them so regularly, but they came back with nothing. Someone then told me about taking L-Lysine to prevent them.  I found Lysine which is a herbal supplement and bought some which I was taking - I wasn't being very commited and I didn't get the result quick enough and gave up.  But about 6 months to a year later I was desperate, so I tried Lysine again.  It took around 3-6 months for me to notice the difference but now that I stuck to it I would never go back.  Lysine has literally saved me from a coldsore meltdown that was taking hold of me.   I take 1000mg a day, and then if I'm feeling tired, run down or stressed I will increase this to around 3000mg a day.  Likewise if I feel a tingle or see a mark I increase the dosage, and at times hold ice in the area and they 9/10 times don't materialise.  From the twice monthly coldsores I was getting, I have had around 3 in the last year which is such an improvement. I used to be so anxious about doing things or, having a late night or going away on holiday in the sun JUST in case it brought one on, but now I will literally take extra Lysine away with  me just in case and I've not had a problem. It is something you have to stick at and its not the cheapest thing (I buy mine from Holland and Barrett in the penny sale and generally get around 120 tablets for around £13,) but it has been so worth it and I would never go back. I have often read these reviews and not believed them, but I really believe if anyone has an issue with regular coldsores and its getting them down, Lysine is definitely the way forward!!! 8 likes, 43 replies "

My progesterone was tested and was very low compared to my estrogen.  I took it every day for the first month, then was switched to 14 days on/14 off because my obgyn said this more closely mimics the natural way progesterone is released in our body.  It was like a miracle for my sleep and low moods.  However, on my days off, the sleep would get a bit worse, and I was still having GI issues.  I went to see an obgyn who was more educated on the bioidentical hormones and she is suggesting I take Progesterone SR 150mg EVERY day because she feels I am estrogen dominant and that is what is causing my symptoms.  I have only taken it for 2 days so far, but the sleep hasn't been nearly as good, and I am having some low moods during the day.  Has anyone else had experience with both of these modes of taking it?  Any opinions on what worked better? Also, has anyone who has been on Progesterone long term experienced any negative effects when stopping?  I am only 43, so I have a LONG road ahead of me.  Thank you! 0 likes, 2 replies "

Frozen Shoulder,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/what-to-do-now--678387,What to do now?,"Hi folks!  Back in March I tore my Labrum at work.  A slip and catch while exiting a piece of machinery. It took a while to figure out the issue, as a work comp claim, but on June 14th of this year I had surgery. My Doc found a reverse bankart tear as well a a SLAP tear which he repaired with 4 anchors. Post Op.  Things looked pretty good until week 4 ish when my shoulder started getting more painful and stiff. Doc said I had Adhesive Capsulitis, my physical therapist said he didn't believe that was my issue, and I proceeded to go to physical therapy. My employer pushed to have me go back to ""light duty"", and when I spoke to my Doc.  He said his hands were tied, because their job description did not require use of my gimpy left arm.  Issues like not being able to sleep, and barely being able to maintain my household as a single parent did not matter in the situation. So I go back to work, while also having 8 appointments a week.  3 phy therapy, 3 chiropractic, and three massage/needling. My employer lied, my job requires me to use my gimpy arm to do 90 percent of the secretarial work they asked me to do.  After a few days my back locked up and my shoulder pain was unacceptable. I returned to the Doc, and he took me off work a month and scheduled me for a cortisone shot. I had my shot a couple weeks ago, and was evaluated by his semi retired colleague who specialized in shoulders and frozen shoulder. He told me that I doubtlessly have frozen shoulder, and spent a half hour telling me about how much the next 18 months are going to suck. He also recommend not irritating the shoulder, for that causes more scar tissue, and to try and keep as much mobility as it runs its course. Info about me before the question. I am 39, male, an electrician by trade, 6ft 9, and a single full time parent to two kids, 15 and 9. My questions are this.... Will I be required to work light duty even though I can't sleep and the arm is so easily irritated? Is it better to let it thaw on it's own or get additional surgery? For those of you with this issue, how long before the bulk of the pain went away?  How useful was the arm that was frozen?

I think I injured my shoulder about 5 months ago when undressing as I experienced very sharp pain that lasted for 5 mind or so and happened a few times then eased up over time so I ignored it.  Then late in August playing squash I knocked my shoulder and the pain was excruciating for a minute.  Fast forwards 3 weeks and suddenly noted a lot more permanent ache and loss of movement. Have seen a physio who suggested a lot of passive movements including pushing up my arm to its limit of movement i can achieve, he stated this was to reduce the amount of movement loss, I have been doing this and it helps a little bit hurts like he'll and next day it seems to return mostly to the previous state.  Does anyone have any similar experience and can this reduce amount of movement loss? Also does the loss occur gradually with no improvements any days or is it gradual with some days better than othets? 0 likes, 11 replies "

What I finally did was....nothing. I let nature take its course. No one could agree on anything. One surgeon wanted to do a manipulation. Another said ""No."" One PT was aggressive with treatment; another was gentle. Massage tx helped initially but not for long. Acupuncture not really. I did my own research and as time went on, my shoulder gradually got less and less painful. At this point, a year in, I have almost no pain and rom is much better...maybe 50% un all three areas. I just started doing gentle stretching. From everything I have read and what I am experiencing, it WILL get better on its own. Good luck to everyone,,,,a horrible condition! 1 like, 8 replies "

Frozen Shoulder,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/frozen-shoulder-treatments-684798,Frozen Shoulder Treatments,"In January, I began getting a slight sharp shooting pain in my left shoulder. My regular doctor said I probably injured my rotator cuff and prescribed at home PT. As all of you with FS know, it just got more and more painful. So I went to an ortho at John Hopkins who through an MRI and physical exam confirmed it was FS.  Unfortunately, due to a medical condition, I am unable to take traditional pain medicines. The ortho offered cortisone, but I just did not want to risk it causing a cascade of side effects in my body. So here are some of the things I found helpful in this agonizing condition. Pillows! Lots of pillows to position the body for maximum comfort. Ice packs! From large ones to drape over my shoulder to small ones to slip under my shirt at work. Topicals! Tiger Balm, Biofreeze, and Arnica all helped reduce the pain to some degree.  Medical Cannabis! In both tinctures and topicals. The topicals are outstanding for temporary pain relief. I could not tolerate the tinctures well, but when I did use them the pain relief was complete, absolutely no pain.  Unfortunately, medical cannabis is not available in most states. Trigger point massage with a Thera cane. I was skeptical at first, but I found numerous ""sore spots"" Massaging those with the theracane really helped reduce muscle pain and soreness. Finding relief and comfort is one thing, but the pain is relentless. It became a daily mental challenge to face yet another day of pain, accompanied by exhaustion from lack of sleep. I had an ad on my cellphone for Curable.com, and I signed up. Their methods of meditation, mind speak, and other techniques definitely improved my quality of life. Instead of being consumed by my FS, letting it define me completely, using the Curable app I was able to mentally cope again. I have also worked with a kind and caring physical therapist who helped and encouraged me to regain my ROM. PT is hard work, and often very uncomfortable, but it also helped reduce pain by increasing ROM. During this year of FS, even though the pain started to reduce, I was stuck in a pattern of sleep two hours, awake for hour, sleep an hour or so, and awake again, leaving me totally exhausted.  In a last ditch effort, I went to acupuncture, and after the very first treatment, I slept the entire night through. I feel it has also speeded along my ROM. In summary, FS is awful, but there are ways to find relief. Try everything and know that ""this to will pass."" 3 likes, 0 replies "
Frozen Shoulder,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/frozen-shoulder-after-elbow-surgery-684593,Frozen shoulder after elbow surgery,"10 weeks ago, I underwent open tendon release surgery on my elbow after 2 years of persistent tendonitis.  I was in a cast from my shoulder to my wrist for 8 days, followed by a jointed metal brace that I wore for 6 weeks.  The brace was calibrated to allow my elbow only slight movement while it healed.  I did PT for 3 months prior to surgery without much success, which is why I reluctantly agreed to surgery. Currently, I've been in vigorous PT, twice a week for over 2 hours a session.  The pain in my elbow from scar tissue is really bad, but worse - I now have  frozen shoulder in that arm.  Doing PT is almost unbearable.  My orthopedic surgeon has offered me the option of a cortisone injection in my shoulder or manual manipulation under anesthesia.  Neither option appeals to me, as I am a bit surgery-phobic now, and injections prior to surgery never did anything. I'm a 59 year old woman, in good health and I've always tried to stay active.  I am in constant pain, can't sleep well and I'm very discouraged.   To any of you who've experienced frozen shoulder, what do you recommend?  Shots?  Surgery?  Or, is it possible that with time/PT/ home exercises it will resolve itself? Thank you for reading this. 0 likes, 10 replies "
Frozen Shoulder,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/frozen-shoulder-for-past-year-post-trigenics-oat-procedure-641821,Frozen shoulder for past year - post Trigenics OAT procedure,"In March 2017 I went to gym after a lengthy hiatus and was doing pretty good, gradually increasing the weight levels. While doing overhead pull downs I felt a sharp pain in my left shoulder, so decided to lay off that exercise for a day or two. But when I tried it again I once more had the pain in my shoulder. Now, it seems I added too much weight to the pull downs. Roll forward 2 months an my shoulder starts to freeze on me. So my doc diagnosed a rotator cuff tear and injected with cortisone which worked and I got back 90% mobility. But, he didn't refer me to physio. Instead, I went to a chiropractor on my own and he used a machine call 'shockwave therapy' which did not help and he then used accupuntcture, again with little success. But I got through the summer, developing my front and back yards and continued playing golf. Come October my stiffness and pain had returned, so my doc once again injected cortisone. This time I got about 80% function return. But again, no referral to physio. The shot wore off in January, about 6 weeks ago and the pain and stiffness came back, this time worse than before. SO, I once more saw my doc, who said I had my maximum for cortisone in that shoulder for a 12 month period. He then said he would refer me to an orthopedic surgeon who specializes in shoulders and knees.  So, still waiting for the appointment my pain became almost unbearable. I had no sleep for days on end. I heard about the Trigenics OAT procedure and signed up, having my procedure done last week in Toronto. So, this is day 6 and I have about 70% restored function. The exercise are every 3 hours and in some ranges are still really painful, but I knew to expect this. Along with the exercises, there is dietary advice and vitamin/mineral supplements. The cost of the procedure was very expensive for me, a retiree with no added insurance. So, it is a case of waiting it out and doing the exercises as prescribed. But they guarantee success, so I am very hopeful. But, now that I am exercising and using my good arm as a support I am concerned of the good arm also freezing. Other than doing the exercises, is there anything else I should do to prevent freezing of the good arm? I am a 68 year old type 2 diabetic and fairly well controlled on oral hypoglycemics and exercise. Has anyone tried   to breakdown forming adhesions and also to dissolve existing adhesions?

Frozen Shoulder,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/there-is-hope-i-am-thawing-here-s-what-i-did-685960,There is Hope: I am Thawing. Here's what I did,"I am officially thawing! I don't want to jinx this because I have a real fear my hips freeze one day (I've had some minor hip discomfort lately but that could just be because I go on daily walks and I just tweaked something), but my shoulders are thawing. I see light at the end of the tunnel finally. Little background: in my 33rd year on this planet, my left shoulder became symptomatic on June 6th, 2016 (I keep a journal so I know the exact day this started) and has been in pain until about only 10-14 days ago. It's been thawing maybe for the last three months or so at least, but the thawing phase has been painful for me. They said it wouldn't be painful at this point in the process, but the ""experts"" are obviously clueless about this disease. The thawing phase has been painful for me. As I said, the pain first started to go away in the left shoulder only about 10-14 days ago. I suddenly have some mobility again too, but not much: no external rotation still and I can't come close to lifting my arm above my head, but at least the shoulder ""folds inward"" now when I raise the arm. For a very long time (two years or so), the upper part of the shoulder did not fold inward when I attempted to raise my arm. The entire thing would simply move as one. My right shoulder became symptomatic in early December 2017 and has began thawing in just the last one or two days, but is still mildly painful. It is clearly ""folding inward"" as well when I attempt to raise my arm up though, so that's a clear sign to me it's also thawing. I wish I knew the exact medical term for what I'm trying to describe. The right shoulder also has zero external rotation, but has more overall mobility than the left shoulder (probably because I realized with the second frozen shoulder to not listen to my doctors). The treatments I've done: The first series of shoulder doctors I saw all insisted on intense physical therapy, so that's what I did for months from around March thru August of 2017. I did a short round of prednisone too during that time. The most aggressive procedure I had done was in June of 2017 when I had two PRP injections into the left shoulder: one into the bursa and one directly into the capsule itself. The executive summary of all these things is that they made everything significantly worse and if I had to do it over, I wouldn't have done any of this. These doctors were and are absolutely clueless about how to treat adhesive capsulitis. Prednisone didn't have any negative side effects, but it was totally ineffective for me I think. It was during this period where my left shoulder felt horrific every day. I describe the feeling as ""rotting from the inside out."" It was a very scary feeling. It felt like my arm would fall off every single day, and this intense pain lasted over a year. On December 23rd, 2017, when my right shoulder was just in the beginning stages of freezing, was the day I realized that this is a disease and not an injury. I had read many blogs that said people realize after a while to do nothing, so on this day (according to my journal) I decided once for all to stop messing with it. On December 23rd, 2017, I decided I would officially ""do nothing"" and let the disease run its course. My doctors looked at me like I was an idiot. They treated me with disrespect. Numerous people in my life tried to pressure me into surgery and/or physical therapy, but I blocked them all out. At that point, I knew my best option had to be to ""do nothing."" I had to do what I had to do. Period. Today is November 17th, 2018, and the pain in the left (first) frozen shoulder has finally gone. As I said, it's been thawing for several months already, but the thawing phase has been painful; not as painful as previous stages, but still painful, especially when ""testing"" it out. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be rehabbing it when it started thawing too, but I ended up choosing to continue to do nothing. I think that was the right choice, but I have no idea. Keep in mind, a lot of what I'm reporting here is just my anecdotal experience. The second frozen shoulder was still painful but not nearly as bad as the first. Why that is the case is anyone's guess, but here's what I did for the second one: I never once did any physical therapy for it. I did do a round of prednisone for six days early in the freezing stage, so maybe that helped, but at the time, I felt it was useless. Other than that, I just iced it when it hurt a lot or took a pain killer. I only took pain killers maybe once or twice a week to avoid dependence. It's a little short of a year since the right shoulder started to freeze, so clearly it's been much milder. The first frozen shoulder has taken 2.5 years to reach the same point. The second shoulder was still very, very painful and brutal but it never reached the extreme heights of pain or chronic length of the first one. Starting in April of 2017 or so I began taking regular vitamins: a daily multi, magnesium, omega-3, vitamin D, and vitamin K. I did take MSM maybe once or twice a week. I tried glucosamine and chondroitin as well, but for maybe only two or three months before giving it up. I've been taking flaxseed oil with omega-3 pills over the last month or so. I've also drank occasional tumeric shots over the last month or so. Oh yea, I took aleve sometimes over the course of the last 2.5 years too. I'm not sure if that helped it heal, but it would reduce my pain sometimes. I tried to eat healthy foods during the last 2.5 years, but I often just comfort ate bad food because that helped me psychologically. I gained 30 pounds in the last 2.5 years, so I comfort ate a lot and sat in a comfortable chair using my computer for many, many hours. For a long time, even just walking around was painful on my shoulder(s). Even in the last two-three months during my regular walks, there would be pain, but I could tolerate it. I knew it was just a symptom of the disease, so at this point, I just continued my walks. As soon as the walk ended, the pain would subside and go away within fifteen minutes. The only reason I would ""push through"" in this situation is because I came to the conclusion a few months ago that this type of pain wasn't making anything worse. I felt the benefits from walking and getting some sun outweighed the mild pain I would get while walking. I've since been able to lose 11 pounds in the last two months, so that's good. Anyway, I have still very limited mobility in both shoulders. Hopefully they keep thawing. I have no idea what the next few years will bring with this and how much mobility I'll ultimately regain. But there is some hope now. I have no idea if the things I did made this better or worse. It's possible that we all have varying severities of the disease and that our genetic makeup largely determines the length of the illness. I really don't know. But this is what I did and am continuing to do. I'll continue with my regimen of vitamins and (mostly) healthy eating. I enjoy going on daily walks so I'll continue that as well. And whenever I feel ready for it, I'll get back into the gym and gradually start rebuilding my upper body which has atrophied quite a bit. Thanks for reading, guys. I will follow up this post with updates at some point. As I said, the right shoulder is still painful, but it's very very tolerable pain. It's nothing I can't handle at this point as I'm obviously used to much, much worse. There is hope. You can't see it now, but there is hope. Please hold on to it. Don't let it go. Please don't let it go. I'm with you in spirit, wherever you are. A lot of us are. PS- A small note on what I mean when I say ""doing nothing."" I let my arms swing when I go on walks. I was able to still carry grocery bags, but that type of action doesn't require any shoulder mobility. I did stuff like that, but I wouldn't move it all around or stretch it ever. If walking was too painful, I would just sit down and start icing it for twenty minutes to help it calm down. During the most painful stretches of the disease, I did as little as I possibly could. I've probably watched every good movie and TV show ever made in the last 2.5 years to the point where I ran out of decent entertainment a few months ago. I read so many books. Blood Meridian was my favorite during this span of time. PPS- We are all connected by this disease. I will update my progress here one day, hopefully with more positive news. 3 likes, 8 replies "

After trying acupuncture and dealing with it myself, I finally sought out an orthopedic surgeon who did the diagnosis. He wrote a script for physical therapy which I started to do; however one of the aspects  of the therapy included deep massage which was painful and I am not sure the person doing it knew anything about frozen shoulders. I decided to quit going to physical therapy and just do it on my own. One of the worst things is just not getting a good night's sleep. I can't lay on the shoulder and even laying on my good shoulder causes pain in my bad shoulder so I wind up propping myself up on 3 pillows and catching a couple of hours here and there. Does anyone have suggestions?  Also, sometimes the pain is really bad with the pain traveling down my arm and into my hand. I have read with interest on this forum about overdoing the physical exercises and I think I am guilty of doing just that so going to really back off for a while to see if that helps.

Frozen Shoulder,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hydrodilatation-my-experience-489438,Hydrodilatation - my experience,"I've decided to start another thread on here to document my experiences with Hyrodilatation (also spelled Hydrodilation or known as Arthrographic Distension) and how well it works for me over the next few weeks or so. A brief background, in case anyone didn't read my original thread.  I started with odd pains in my shoulder in spring, this year, with no apparant cause and I assumed I'd just pulled a muscle or something like that and hoped it would go away on it's own.  It got worse over the summer and I also started to lose movement. I had the usual excrutiating pain on knocks or jerks and aches right down my arm.  Pain, lack of sleep and loss of movement finally drove me to the GP in September where I was diagnosed with a frozen shoulder.  I managed to seek physiotherapy with Bupa (or I'd still be on the NHS waiting list) and was recommended by a physio to see a consultant with a view to Hydrodilatation. I had my Hydrodilatation this afternoon - 14th December.  A few hours on and I'm feeling fine.  I was very nervous but the procedure itself went well and took 15-20 minutes in total.  I'd worn a vest top, which meant I didn't need to wear a gown and just dropped my straps off my bad shoulder.  I was asked to lie on my front, with a pillow for support.  I'd thought the procedure was done via x-ray guidance but it was in fact ultrasound guided.  The doctor explained what was about to happen and did an initial scan of my shoulder area before giving me a local anaesthetic.  He then put in the needle for the hydrodilatation, which administered first some cortisone and then saline.  He said I might feel some pushing and to let him know if it became painful.  There was some discomfort but I wouldn't describe it as painful and within a few minutes, he said the saline had started to leak out of the joint and the procedure was over.  He did another scan and checked my movement before and after - there was perhaps a couple of degrees improvement but nothing drastic.  I left the hospital with a plaster on my shoulder and feeling fine.  He said I might experience a bit of aching once the local anaesthetic wears off but the cortisone should kick in within a day or two and should improve things pain-wise. Physiotherapy is recommended within a few days of the procedure and I have an appointment with the physio on Friday morning and another to see the consultant again in about 6 weeks.  So far, so good but it remains to be seen how sucessful it has been in improving pain and getting my movement back.  I can currently lift my arm about 90 degrees in front, slightly less at the side and very little behind my back. I will document my progress over the next few days and weeks, for anyone else considering this treatment.  Hope this information is of help to someone and fingers crossed that the procedure works for me! 6 likes, 208 replies "

Herpes - Non Genital,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/a-couple-questions-about-cold-sores-686007,A couple questions about cold sores,"Hi! This is my first post here, and let me start by saying I have a very severe case of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) to the point of being on disability. My obsessions mainly center around health, so please take caution with whatever you reply as not to frighten me--I could obsess for months or even years. I have two questions about  . One, how likely is it to actually spread a cold sore from your lip to your eye? I've been obsessing over this so badly that I'm not getting good sleep at night. I usually sleep on my stomach, head and face rubbing all over the pillow, tossing and turning. But I'm afraid that if I let that happen I'll infect my eye from the pillow. I also have been refusing to wear my hair down because it gets in my face and I don't want it to spread it around my face. With OCD, this cold sore is maddening. My other question is how long can the tingling last? Can it last throughout the entire cold sore? I've had two in a row. The first one I had was on the lower-right lip, took a week to heal, and the tingling stopped about two days in. This one seems much worse, is on the upper-left lip and is making my whole face tingle! And it hasn't stopped. For the record, I think I’m somewhere between the “weeping” and the “scabbing” stage. I seem to have one small blister at the top that hasn’t burst, but the rest is a crusty brown that’s starting to detach. I’m on day 3-4, and I’m using Abreva. Thanks! 0 likes, 1 reply "

This last one was really annoying as I would just return from a lovely holiday only to find that within a couple of days I would get a cold sore! My cold sores were always on my lip. For the last 20 plus years, I have probably only had about 3 cold sores in this whole time - in fact I thought I had seen the last of them. Then last summer I went into hospital for a heart procedure and within 3 days of coming home, I developed a really bad viral cold. As that began to subside, I developed a really bad sore on the outside of one of my nostrils - it was so sore but I put it down to blowing my nose a lot. However in the last 12 months, I have had these outbreaks virtually every month. I have also had 4 colds! I believe these sores on my nose are cold sores as they are small blisters but they are totally different to my teenage cold sores. Does anyone know if it is possible to be infected by a different type of herpes virus? At the moment it is pretty virulent and unpleasant. I have never consulted my gp about my cold sores but I was seriously thinking of doing so. Any thoughts? 0 likes, 1 reply "

I've had some recent STd testing , but I'm expecting the results to be negative when they come back on Monday as they've always been negative in the past and I'm in a monogamous relationship . These blisters in my mouth started 20+ years ago in an encounter that involved an exchange of saliva (kissing ) . Soon after that, I developed a Lesion on the underside of my tongue that was somewhat fleshy in color with a white crown . It lasted for several days , broke open and bleed a bit, and eventually went away and never returned to that location . In the ensuing years, I would continue to routinely get these lesions in my mouth in the soft fleshy areas (usually at the base of the mouth under the tongue , back of the throat , or occasionally inside of the cheeks ) . These lesions would sometime be flesh colored with white tops . Other times they would be as shown in these images . They never last more than a day or two  before they break open , drain , and feel almost as of nothing was ever there . Lately I've had one that is recurring in one location under my tongue in the soft areas at the base of the gums. It forms , last a day or two , then opens and drains and goes away for a few days .

The cold sores are covering my lips, are constantly cracking, drying out my mouth and from time to time bleeding in the corners. A pattern seems to occur as they seem to go around my mouth and then where it seems like one is about to go away, it appears on another point of the mouth and so on and when that new cold sore is about to go away the itchiness appears in a new point and on the next day, more cold sores. I have had them now for around seven months and I just cannot stand it anymore, the itching, the cracking, the dryness, the swelling of my lips and ultimately the disgust of just having them. It's effected my mental health since I am now embarrassed to be seen by people and I am just constantly irritated and angry. Nothing/ nobody seems to be able to help (That is not their fault) and I do not know what to do anymore. Please can anybody offer me a small amount of relief?

I am going to see my doctor about it soon, but I would like advice. I've already tried lysine tablets and it didn't help me at all.

Hidradenitis Suppurativa,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/surgery-for-somwhat-mild-case--689560,Surgery for Somwhat Mild Case?,"I've had HS for about 3 years. Compared to many others I'd consider my case somewhat mild. It limited to only one location (groin). When its active it doesn't seem to fully heal (some drainage usually present), but flares are controlled mostly with antibiotics. Initially, I took Minocyclin (1 year). It seemed to keep the flares to about 1x per month, but I was not interested in being on an antibiotic forever to keep this in check. I read about trials done with Clindamycin and Rifampin (sp) and asked my doctor about it. He put my on that combo for 3 months. The 2nd and 3rd month were basically symptom-free, and I had another 3+ months after I finished the course without flares. Unfortunately, it seems to be coming back. I had 2 flares in the past couple weeks where the skin inflamed. Once the boil released, the pain calmed, but it feels like this may continue into a similar state to where I first sought medical advice. My doctor in the past has recommended Humira, which I'm not really willing to consider at this point. So I suppose my options are to try another round of Clindamycin and Rifampin with the symptoms not being so bad and hope it goes into a longer remission -- maybe I can get away with being on antibiotics for 3-6 months per year instead of all year round like I was with the Minocyclin. Or alternatively, I could look into surgical options. My doctor did not recommend it. He said that it doesn't cure the underlying condition (autoimmune) so it will recur in another location. I was curious for those who had surgery, especially those with less severe cases like mine -- did you have the disease pop up in a new location? Are you overall happy with the result? I had a pilonidal cyst before HS came on, and now wish I didn't wait so long to have that surgery, so I am very much in the short term pain for a long term cure camp if that is possible. Since I do not have a disease that has spread, I'm hoping that laser surgery could give me some long term relief. Can some others chime in on their experience? 0 likes, 2 replies "

My name is Catherine and I have been suffering with HS for over 23 years. They first started out as red bumps in the vaginal area. After repeated infections my doctor surgically removed the tissue. That didn't work. The lesions started appearing in the same location but on the opposite side. My physician didn't know what these bumps were and in 2009 he sent me to a dermatologist. She took one look and told me instantly that I had hidradenits suppurativa. I was in shock. I read up on everything I could find. I was put on doxycycline for the next 4 years and was miserable. The anti-biotic would cause me to have yeast problems and subsequently I was put on diflucan to deal with the yeast. It was a never ending problem. Now my red bumps were rupturing and weeping. This was new for me. I went online to read as much as I could about HS. I read medical information and blogs.  It was highly informative. There was a commonality of humiliation and pain, depression and the desire to feel normal. One entry caught my attention. It was about a woman who had suffered from HS and finally went to a Naturopath. He gave her two food sensitivity tests,an IgE and an IeE. She found out what foods she was allergic to and immediately removed them from her diet. She is now HS free. I couldn't afford to go see a Naturopath and so I decided to start on a diet of protein (chicken) and salad (basic lettuce,cucumbers with olive oil and vinegar), vegetables such as green beans, squash, carrots, english peas,broccoli, cauliflower. I removed eggs, dairy, gluten which is in bread and a myriad of foods which include flour. I also removed Nightshade veggies and fruits.  Once I was stable ...which took about a week, I added eggs. I had no flares. That food was safe. I then added dairy products, again no flares. I added beef and fish with no problems. I was anxious about adding flour/gluten back into my diet as I was sure that this was the food group that I was sensitive to. However, after introducing gluten back into my diet there were no flares. That left me with only one group to test and that was the Nightshade veggies and fruits. This group includes: white potatoes, tomatoes, peppers including paprika (not white or black pepper), gooseberries and goji berries. These foods have alkaloids in them to fight off bugs. Interesting? So, I added foods from this group into my diet and ....I FLARED!! I finally had the information that I needed. I immediately went through my pantry and removed any and everything with red pepper, tomatoes,and paprika. Paprika is everywhere. It is in hot dogs, mayonnaise, mustard and seasonings. If you eat processed foods...beware as it is in everything. I learned to read all the labels of everything at the grocery store and even double check it  once it was  in my pantry. I am in remission and I intend to stay there.My lesions are flat. All that exists are scars and I can live with that. I am certain that HS is the body's response to a food that the body is allergic to. It is not due to ""not being clean enough"" or due to being overweight. It will only respond to antibiotics for a short term and then those fail to work. Topicals don't work either. I do believe that once HS comes into your life, it takes over everything that you love. I was a victim to this disease for too many years. I have now, taken back my life.  You can change your diet and be free. I recommend that if you decide to find out what foods you may be allergic to in order to be free from this disease that you consider incorporating these supplements: turmeric (wonderful anti-inflammatory), zinc, vitamin c, a probiotic, and green tea for itching It is a natural anti-histamine. I hope you find this helpful. God Bless You 34 likes, 68 replies "

Hip Dysplasia and Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-experience-with-hip-dysplasia-and-pao-surgeries-672603,My Experience With Hip Dysplasia and PAO Surgeries,"I wanted to share my experience with this, because of the little amount of knowledge and discussion on this topic when I was in need of research of it. I am a 17 year old male, living in North Carolina. In eighth grade I was diagnosed with Acetabular Hip Dysplasia. I was bullied constantly for the way I walk and run. One PE teacher went as far to make a video mocking me telling other students to ""Run like Colton"". After being diagnosed, I traveled to several hospitals and specialists across the state and finally settled with Dr. Virginia Casey at Carolina Orthopedic in Charlotte. She agreed to do my first PAO alongside Dr. Brighton. My first POA happened on May 31st of 2017. This was my first surgery ever and it was very stressful leading up to the surgery. I prayed about it and eventually came to peace with it. I was very unsure about anesthesia and so on, so I will give you some insight. As soon as I got to my room at Levene Children's Hospital in Charlotte, I changed into my gown and they started my IV. This was the worst part of the surgery. I have great veins but horrible luck so the IV was rough. I am however more scares of needles than most people. They sedated me through the IV which was incredibly effective. In three seconds of the sedation going into the IV, my eyes drooped and became very heavy. Suddenly the worry and anxiety of surgery was diminished and I no longer feared the risks of having surgery. I felt that dying would not really even matter at that point. That statement is rather alarming, yet my mind was extremely soothed at this thought. As my family said their final goodbyes, I saw the love in my grandfather's eyes that I had not seen in many many years, a special mix of concern, curiosity and comforting love. I watched as the hospital lights passed by my tired eyes. They rolled me into a room of what seemed like all metal. I was placed on a metal bed, with metal clanging and crashing behind me. I stared up at the lights surrounded by a metal ring. The metal exam light hung low above my head. I tried to count how many people were in that room but my mind was not in a place to count very well, making the nurses seem countless and identical. A focused, busy lady approached my right side. My eyes were now too heavy to look her in the eyes as she raised up a mask above my face, claiming ""this is going to be a little but of oxygen"". If only oxygen acted like that all of the time... I had planned to fight the anesthesia like a cowboy and see how much I could take, but just like a baby, I was asleep instantly. It did not hurt, it did not tingle, but it felt as if my eyes were being forced down by the strength of a thousand men. I woke up in an orange room. I was sure that something had gone wrong because it felt like I had instantly awoken from anesthesia and the surgery had never happened. Thankfully I was wrong. My mouth was eternally dry, and my pleas for water were ignored by the nurse in the room, rightfully so however. They brought my parents into the room which I instantly asked whether or not the nurse was hot. She was standing right next to me. I then began cussing repeatedly, and had to be reminded that I was in a children's hospital. So, I decided to sing. My song choice however was not appropriate in a hospital of potentially terminally ill children, so my cries of ""I'll fly away"" were not appreciated by the nurse or my mother. The estimsted hospital time for a PAO is 3-4 days. I left the next day. I slept horribly, and any time of rest that I did manage to achieve was interrupted by a nurse checking my vital signs or a faulty beeping heart moniter which seemed to assume my heart had stopped and a nuclear attack was imminent. I mentioned earlier that the worst part of the surgery was the IV. The only other comparable issue was when the IV had to be taken out. The tape on my skin was stronger than steel and seemed to be welded to my body. Things got immediately better when I got home. The ride home was tough because I was sensitive to bumps in the road, and I had an hour and a half to get home. After arriving home I sat down and started my recovery. I watched a ton of movies, rewatched the entire series of ""The Office"" again, and slept a lot. I do want to mention one pretty big problem I had. I lost a lot of blood in this surgery, that made me have some pretty bad swelling. I am a guy so it wasnt just my hips that swelled. My left testicle swelled to the size of an orange. It didnt cause much extra pain but it was hard to manuvere and move it out of the way sometimes. The swelling did quickly get better though, so do not be worried if it happens to you. It sucked but it was not the end of the world and I have been through worse in my life. You can do it and it will not be fun but it is absolutley doable and I am glad I did it. As soon as I recovered and finished physical therapy, I got back in the gym. People will tell you to ""take it easy on them hips"" or ""don't over-do it"" and some are totally fine with taking that advice, but I was not. I had not properly run since the fourth grade. I credit a lot of my ability to run to physical therapy. I love to run and during the year after my first surgery, I ran nearly every day. It hurt at first but I noticed that the longer I ran, the better it felt. I was building muscle to hold my hips together in the right place finally. I worked out hard and ran hard because it is what I wanted to do. I had a groui p of friends that would play football once a week and we played very hard. I loved it. The first surgery was for my left hip, but my right was still in need of surgery. So we scheduled my surgery for June 27th of 2018. Don't believe anyone that says ""your second surgery wont be as bad, because you know what to expect"". You do not know what to expect, but you probably will do better the second time. You can plan and try to repeat things the second time but it will be different in many ways. I find it quite irksome how many people offer advice to me or try to give me some sort of personal knowledge about hips, especially the people that have normal hips. People will relate your surgery to a total hip replacement every single day. This is nothing like a total hop replacement. A PAO is much more involved and requires much more recovery, but yes Sharon, that is quite wonderful that your cousin had a hip replacement 5 years ago. The biggest difference I noticed with this surgery is that I had much less swelling. The surgeon premedicated me to reduce blood loss and it worked wonderfully. Much less pain, much less swelling, and much better bodily functions. I forgot to mention how hard it was to pee in the hospital with the first surgery. They gave me a silly plastic jug for me to try to pee in while staying in bed. That is not how bladders work, so it did a horrible job. As soon as I got up and went to the toilet however, the floodgates were open. Don't even attempt to try to pee laying down or even sitting on the bedside. It will not work. Anyways, lets get into detail about the second surgery. People assumed I would not be as scared this time. They were incorrect. The fear consumed me, but I decided to have the second surgery. I slept the whole ride to the hospital. I did not want to deal with the emotional hurricane of being awake. I sat in the waiting room which was completely erased from my memory of the first surgery until that point. I saw the fear in a young boys eyes as he anticipated whatever he was about to face that day. His parents sat closeby. They were trying to hide the fear they were inevitably cursed with. They tried to hide the fact that they really had no idea what they were doing but they were trying their best, and that is what mattered. His fathers hands were rough and calloused from work. His mother held a folder of medical paperwork and xrays. You could barely see her hands shaking. I thought about life as I sat in that room, about the what-ifs and whether or not I would be able to have that same care and fear for my children some day. My thoughts were interrupted by a nurse in purple calling my name. She didnt know who I was, just another patient on her shift that day. It made me wonder if she treated all of her patients with the cardboard respect that I recieved. I was soon assigned a small room. I changed into my gown and my family and friends soon filled the room. I cried as I heard the prayer said for me that day. The solitude in his voice reassured me that he knew he wasn't just saying words, but he was talking to someone in control of what would happen to me that day. The nurses started my IV. They once again took multiple stabs to achieve this. They sedated me, yet this time I handled it much better. I wasnt nearly as tired as the first surgery's sedation. They stopped at the doorframe when my grandfather grabbed my hospital bed to say goodbye. He said ""I love you"" in a way I had heard only once before in my life, and that was before my first surgery. I called out to him saying ""after while crocodile"". He responded with ""see ya later alligator"" and that is when peace finally set in. They rolled be back to the operating room. It was just as metal as the last time. I remembered to count the people in the room. I counted five but more came in afterwards. I cracked many jokes with the surgeons because I was much more aware of my surroundings this time. As the nurse pressed the mask back onto my face, I interrupted her and said ""So, is this gonna be the 'oxygen'?"" as I raised my hands in quotations. The nurses and surgeons all joined in laughter. They knew they had been caught. I awoke again in the orange room. I was much more cooperative this time because my brain knew where I was. The hospital was full, so I waited 2 hours for my own room. I remember being rather sad at this point. Not enough to cry or complain but the weight had set on my chest that now my summer was officially done and I couldn't go back if I wanted. From then until I got home, all I could think about was snuggling into my bed at home and forgetting any of this happened. It was a very depressed feeling. I have never smoked or drank and neither has anyone in my family, but at that moment I needed a strong shot of whiskey and a cigarette to help me mope in my sorrow. I slept about 2 hours that night. My heart monitor was even more faulty than last time, alarming exactly every 5 minutes and even sooner if I breathed too hard. I eventually yanked it off my finger and told the nurse to cut it off and that I would let someone know if my heart stops. They put potassium in my IV which they did not do last time. Aparently ""some doctors want it and some doctors don't"". I didn't understand my mother's frustration with the nurse on this decision until I felt what potassium feels like being pushed against a valve through my garbage IV. This may have been the worst feeling of my life. You do not need potassium in your IV after this surgery. Feel free to dispute a nurse trying to administer potassium in your IV or you will regret it. The pain shot through my arm. I felt it course through my bloodstream with every beat of my heart. It felt like my veins were being cleaned out with steel wool. The next morning I awoke at 5 am and could not go back to sleep. My mother stayed in the room that night and she helped me change into real clothes that morning. The surgeon's resident came in at 8 and was shocked to see all of my bags packed and me fully dressed and ready to leave. There was one more horrible obstacle before I could depart. They needed to take a blood sample for the lab before I could leave. Unfortunately, the team of goober nurses had never drawn blood in a person as old as me. (I have a full beard in a children's hospital) After many failed attempts by many nurses, my mother, who is a day surgery nurse at a hospital gave them copious instructions on how to do it the right way, but they were clueless. The nurse agreed to let her try to draw the blood as long as she didn't say anything about it. My mother hit the vein perfectly on the first try. After the results came back clear, I was ready to go home. I started my recovery very fast and was anxious to be free again. I swam in the pool within the first week and continued pool excersise regularly. I am currently at the 6 week mark and went for a checkup two dsys ago. I am now walking with one crutch to reduce my limp but can walk without it. I will be driving by the end of the week. Feel free to message me with any questions. I did not think my second surgery would be worth it, but it was and I am happy I did it. I hated being away from friends but I am ready to live life again. THANK YOU DR.

Hidradenitis Suppurativa,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/chinese-medicine-helped-me-597346,Chinese medicine helped me,"I was of the belief that HS is incurable also.  So here’s my story of how I managed to get rid of HS.   The reason I hadn’t posted this before is that I only stumbled upon this forum a day ago. When I contracted HS in 2007, my local doctor gave me medication which temporarily removed my symptoms - the boil-like outbreak, in my armpits. But they just seemed to pop up elsewhere.  He then suggested surgically removing a couple of them as the way to go.  I don't like surgery, no matter how small, so you will know how I felt when they recurred right next to the scar.  While I was working in Hong Kong later that year, some colleagues were adamant that Chinese medicine could cure this.  Those with HS will understand me when I say that I was willing to give anything a go.  So over a number of weeks I had to boil up a rather bizarre concoction, whilst directed to stop eating prawns and chilli.  But the HS persisted, with the hot and sweaty climate making the symptoms worse.  So I became resigned that there really wasn't a cure and I would have to live with this continual discomfort, though the perpetual lack of sleep was driving me around the bend. A year or so later after returning home, a work colleague referred me to a Chinese doctor, to which I replied that I had tried that without success.  However, she urged me to give this doctor a go as she had had great success with a different skin condition affecting her daughter.   So in the end I relented. I made weekly visits for acupuncture, and went away with small sachets of herbs.  I had to combine the contents of each herb sachet with a little hot water and drink when cooled, 3 times a day.  But most importantly, I had to eliminate quite a number of foods from my diet.  At first it was mango, pineapple, chilli & spicy foods, but was quickly extended to the following: all sea food/fish (fresh water fish was okay), all red meat (I could have pork provided it was female - to that point I didn't realise that there was a difference. If you can smell it while it is cooking then it is most likely male – I since found that many European butchers do in fact sell female pork), no BBQ or roasted meat, no deep fried foods, nor pepper, garlic, tomatoes, orange juice, beans, dried biscuits & pizza, alcohol or chocolate.  Quite a list.  I had to continue avoiding these foods until every last trace and blemish had disappeared.  It took 3 - 4 months in all, but it did disappear.  On my last visit she instructed me to permanently avoid mango and pineapple.  I was okay with the latter as it has never reacted well with me, unless picked very ripe, but mango was my favourite fruit!  Anyway I did try my hardest to avoid these two fruits, and did so until a couple of months ago. While travelling recently, I inadvertently had some mango juice, not realising until I had virtually finished the glass.  I thought that I had got away with it, and thought no more of it, but several weeks later, after returning home, I noticed that familiar dull pain in one of my armpits, and sure enough when I looked at my armpit I saw the reddish blemish indicating that HS was re-appearing. So, determined to nip this in the bud, I zipped off to see the Chinese doctor again, and recommenced her treatment of acupuncture, herbs and avoidance of the abovementioned foods.  A few days later I noticed the first signs of boils starting to develop in the other armpit.  Five weeks later after having again strictly avoided the abovementioned foods (and believe me it is sometimes hard when eating out to find something on a menu which is not fried and without tomatoes). I am happy to report that the HS has cleared up, and once again I can enjoy amongst other things, an occasional steak and glass of red! Going forward I will continue to avoid mangos and pineapples, and where possible keep chilli consumption to a minimum.  I am thus convinced that diet does play a big part in the HS outbreaks.  I have no idea whether the herbs and acupuncture are also integral to this treatment – I just went with the flow and it worked for me.  But more to the point, perhaps it may work for some of you.  My first foray with Chinese medicine didn’t help in the slightest, so I guess like any profession, there are some more skilled than others.   I would happily recommend this doctor, but that won't help for most of you - I am in Melbourne, Australia - perhaps the other side of the globe for the majority of this discussion group. However if even one person finds this useful, then posting my story will have been worthwhile. 4 likes, 10 replies "

Hip Dysplasia and Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/sticky-outy-hip-679174,Sticky-outy hip,"Hello. Over the past few years I've become very aware that my hip on the right side sticks out in a point quite significantly (ie quite visibly when undressed). I'm not sure if it came on then or if it has always been like that, although I have taken some hard falls off my bike onto it a few years ago. That particular point doesn't really bother me and varies between no sensation at all and perhaps a very mild ache, but even that might be my imagination. However I have had quite a few running injuries over the past year on my right side, including ITBS, numerous turned ankles, and some kind of muscle strain on the hip and groin. At various times I've mentioned the protrusion and the GP has always said that it's hip bursitis and to take ibuprofen, however a) the ibuprofen hasn't made any difference and b) having had bursitis on my knee it seems very unlike that (ie little pain, no inflammation, pointy rather than generally swollen). My wife is worried that it's going to develop into something more serious as I age (I'm 38 now). Is it something I should be pressing the GP to investigate further or should I just ignore it? 0 likes, 3 replies "

Last year I seen another doctor and he explained to me that I had damaged the ligaments in my right knee. After being referred to both podiatry and physio for 9 months I was told there was no improvement and there was nothing they could do for me . Throughout the past year my hip pain has come one tremendously to the point where i can no longer walk without a limp and when doing any activity the pain intensifies no matter how simply it was . I went on to the orthopaedic department to go over my knee injury however there was no bone damage and went on to x-ray my hip and finally diagnose me with hip dysplasia. I have now been waiting for 8 months for an appointment with the orthopaedics again. This week I have been experiencing really intense sharp pains in my left hip( the one that doesn't have hip dysplasia) this happens when moving left to right or when moving or going to sit.

I've had GTPS for about 3yrs-started getting pain all down my right side from hip outer thigh,knee, calf especially when resting. Had several blind steroid injections, helped a little. Had a guided ultrasound steroid injection at various points in right hip & lateral right knee where fluid was found on ultrasound got 100% relief for a couple of months but it took my local healthcare provider  3mths to organize physio by which time i was only able to attend 2 sessions as the pain had come back to a 9/10 level. it wakes me every night several times causing broken sleep & lots of tossing & turning to get away from the pain. Its like deep bone pain is how i would describe it. I had another guided ultrasound steroid injection 3wks ago, & was hoping for the same relief i got last year from the 1st time i had it done. i was injected at several points in the right hip again, but not the outer knee as the consultant said he could not see any fluid there this time.  The pain  relief has not been the same this time & again i am still tossing & turning being woken several times a night with the pain all down the right side. I am now also getting minor pain down the left side which the consultant said often happens in GTPS due to the body compensating for the bad side. Also since this injection, the pain in the right lateral knee is worse??? I had my first physio appt yesterday since this latest injection. He said the knee pain indicates inflammation with the ITB(iliotal band) & generally all the pain is related to the gluteus muscles & tendons. He has given me some exercises to do & i see him again in 4wks. He also said it can take upto 8wks for steroid injections to give relief/settle down, but as I got 100% relief straight away the 1st time last year, i feel disappointed & worried I will not get any relief this time.....He also said GTPS is often something that doesnt go away & is often dealt with by managing pain as surgical procedures do not give good outcomes mostly. I cannot take any anti inflammatory meds as i also have colitis so pain relief is limited for me. I've tried turmeric, but it gave me acid reflux!!! I would like to hear from anyone with similar experiences , any comments/advice greatly welcomed. Thankyou in advance. xx 0 likes, 10 replies "

My left is causing me lots of symptoms - really severe, worsening pain, particularly bad if I sit for long periods + clicking (although my hips are really clicky anyway). My right is asympomatic at the moment (odd as the dysplasia is worse that side) I recently saw a consultant hip specialist who said that he thinks I have a labral tear (I also had one previously treated a few years back after being told I had impingement rather than dysplasia) and he is 'undecided' if I need a POA. I understand he is the expert but I am feeling very confused about the whole process - surely with a clicky hip with a recurrent labral tear and severe pain surgery is the best option!? It's affected my ability to work (and I love my job) so I don't want to be stuck with OA and a hip replacements in my 50's. Do I need a second opinion or does what he's saying make sense?

Hip Dysplasia and Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/update-to-my-gluteus-medius-tendinopathy-diagnosis-643194,Update to my gluteus medius tendinopathy diagnosis,"Update:  Sorry this is a long read. For those of you that do not know my story, I have been treating what I was told was gluteus medius tendinopathy in my left hip for a year and half with injections and PT.  Latest development wih my condition:   I was going to PT twice a week I was walking OK although I was using ice after walking short distances. I was able to sit in a chair and drive always with an ice pack. Then I was unable to do even that. I’ve been in bed since last a Sunday, have a porta potty next to my bed. Was supposed to have an appointment Tues morning with my primary dr but I couldn’t drive and could not find transportation to take me. So I emailed my primary dr and told her I was in excruciating pain and she said get to the ER and she wrote them an note explaining what was going on with me.  Anyway I went to the ER at a major well known hospital in Boston where all my records are.  That ride to the hospital was unbearably painful. So hard to describe if someone has not had this but the stabbing sharp pain reduces me to tears. I was seen by a doctor and he said it’s was the tendinopathy and takes a long time to heal and that there was no magic bullet to fix overnight, even though my primary dr believes it’s my back and included that in her note to the ER.    He sent me home with lidocaine patches valium and a medpack of prednisone which I had to tell the ER dr that my primary dr said not to leave without this script.  She was quite upset that the ER dr never ordered an X-ray,   or MRI of my back that night! So scheduled for 2 days later the first available appointment to have it Friday night.  By Friday at 2am was doubled over in pain. I had severe tremors and my left leg and side was paralyzed by muscle spasm went to ER by ambulance. After giving me morphine and Valium I had an MRI showed I had a bulging disc at L4 and 5 and nerve compression causing the severe pain in hip thigh groin and buttock.Had an epidural injection at 2:00 PM came home on Oxcy and flexorall and hopefully this is going to do the trick.  Although this may be the beginning of many injections, at least I have a firm diagnosis that I could have treated and not left to shots of the hip and doctors telling me they could do nothing more for me. All this time the dumb drs only we’re treating the hip never looking at my back as a source of this pain.  Only the knee Dr who operated on my torn meniscus (also from favoring the other side and using a cane for 2 months) thought it might be my back. My PM also wanted to look at my back from my symptoms. That's what you get from the medical profession it’s all a guessing game for them. My primary care was awesome during this whole thing so I'm home resting. Hopefully this shot will help but I need to address the situation with a spine specialist and also do some changes in my lifestyle. I will begin aquatic PT and any other kind of treatment to help avoid surgery. I am so thankful this a problem that I hope can be treated successfully although many people have continuing problems such as mine. So now my dear friends in this group, I will now have to join another discussion group but wanted each and everyone of you to heed my warning!  Be your own advocate and pursue every avenue available to you.  God bless and I am here for you anytime, so please reach out if I can help.    2 likes, 5 replies "

He then injected lidocaine for diagnostic purposed. That didn't help at all and actually made it worse.So painful that it was all I could do not to cry.

It really has been a godsend for me  :D  Briefly- I had Perthes diagnosed aged 8, but they caught it late so hip ball was pretty badly mishapen- cue osteotomy, hip spiker etc- followed by 2 more osteotomies before the age of 13. By 15 I'd developed secondary   and the joint deteriorated rapidly (v v painful) and pretty much as soon as I stopped growing my consultant opted for a full hip replacement (I was 19). I had a custom made joint designed after a number of scans, partly due to thickening of the femur from my previous ops, and it is a ceramic plastic composite (ceramic ball onto plastic cup I think).  The initial 3 months post op were fairly hard going, you are not able to move beyond 90degrees abduction so can only sit of high seats- and need a special raised loo seat! I was in a student house at the time so it was a bit embarrassing but I was kitted out by the Red Cross who lent me all the stuff needed for those 3 months- my housemates got so used to the special loo they said they missed it once it was gone!  :oops:  But after lots of physio I can honestly say that it made the world of difference...within days of the op my pain levels were far below what they'd been, I was off crutches within 6 weeks, and cycling a bike again at 3 months (after not being able to cycle since 13!!)- and 6 months later I spent 3 months SCUBA diving in Malaysia!!  :D  At first I had yearly check-ups (x-rays), then every 2 years, until 2 years ago when I was discharged (at least temporarily) from my consultants care! The hip is still not showing any sign of wear- and I am active- walk a lot, have had 2 children with the new hip etc.- so although the initial prospect had been of it lasting only 10-15 years we're now hoping for 20. Anyway crossing each bridge as we come to it. The pain in my hip is 99% gone, but I do suffer a touch with my back and my \""good\"" leg's knee- but both have had to bear the brunt of a lot as I grew up so it's inevitable really... And I see a good (private admittedly) physio fairly regularly to keep on to of things, and try to swim whenever possible...(but not breast- - that's a big no-no for those with hip replacements!). I do still have a leg length discrepancy (2cm) which is partly what causes my back/knee issues. Good luck with getting yours done, I'm sure you won't believe the difference  :D  ~ Annika 1 like, 13 replies "

I was stuck with using a cane, a huge limp and a 3 inch short leg. I could not do much at this point. I was unable to exercise to strengthen before  surgery because my movement was limited and caused a lot of pain and made it hard for me to walk afterwards. Became very sad about everything. Now 4 weeks after surgery, I am excited about life again. My sadness is gone, pain gone, short leg gone and now at perfect length! I move without pain from my   or the surgery, I can do the exercises now and actually feel the muscles working. I haven't felt that in so long, it's exciting. And I am very happy! I changed so quickly from sad to happy, it's such a weird feeling to have. 1st week from surgery, I felt tight and slow moving. My hips were stuck in anterior tilt. The pain seemed fine on the  tiny amount of meds I took. Sleeping was very uncomfortable. I took lots of naps. 2nd week, sleeping still annoying. Starting to move a bit more. End of week 2 I stopped using a walker and started with crutches. Muscles are starting to loosen up. 3rd week, out and about walking with crutches. I put a lot of weight on them and got sore hands but it was worth it! Once I was back inside I was very tired and had naps. I also stopped taking pain meds around here. Also quit taking the blood thinners because they were making me very itchy all over my body and dry. Anterior tilt starting to go away. 4th week, doing great. I can walk pretty fast with my crutches. I tried to walk without them but my leg is not strong yet and I limp to the side. I am also not allowed to walk freely (Dr's orders) but I wanted to test it out anyway.  Anterior tilt gone. Muscles are no longer tight. I still can't move my leg freely, need longer to heal first. I am not allowed to do harder exercises, tilt or bend etc for a while..

Now that my operation is only 3 day away - I am so nervous, scared, etc. etc.  I guess I am looking up everything on the internet and seeing what can ""go wrong"" - so I probably should have a positive outlook and faith in my doctor.   Is each person different - are restrictions lifted on some people earlier than others?   Can you sleep on your side?  I have been using a cane/walker and cannot walk on my own right now - so I know my balance is going to be off - how do you get that back?  What are the best exercises everyone found to be most helpful?  Is walking outside a good exercise?

Just received the results of the MRI and wanted to see what I am dealing with. Thank you. Yes, I have a follow up appt. with my ortho. RESULTS: Mild hip joint degenerative disease with diminished articular cartilage and labral tear/degeneration anterosuperiorly associated with cam femoral acetabular impingement.  Mild gluteal insertional tendinosis and trochanteric bursitis.  SO, based on the appt. yesterday and my previous it looks like I will be having surgery. I saw an orthopedic hip specialist and based on the MRI/XRAYS, this is my only option. He indicated that the ball on my femur has an extra bone this making the ball uneven. He said this occurred during my adolescent years and it happened at my growth plate. He will need to shave the bone down, re attach the labrum with anchors. He said he does close to 500 of the procedures a year and it very common. The doctor is affiliated with HSS(Hospital for Special Surgery). I won't mention names as I don't know if that's allowed.

I have had similar pains in the past but not quite in this area and not as so much. It is getting to the point that I can not sleep and I barely eat due too so much pain I get dizzy and or sick to my stomach.

I was hoping to last just three months to get caught up in some bills and get some medical equipment since I am on disability but they keep making cut backs on it. I am trying to last even to the end of the month now so hopefully my mom can have a job by than but it is getting so hard. I am at my wits end and do not now what to do. I am the only one who currently has any money coming in and every single penny is going to rent and stuff. I have not even gotten a hair cut in 3 years because money is so tight. And now this stupid pain just will not go away instead of getting better it gets worst. I am so scared I am at the point that I take almost five minutes to get up to go pee (my bedroom is right beside the bathroom). I pray just to get through the night at work and not collapse, there have been a few close calls just last night alone. And I do not dare say anything to mom due to the fact that she is already freaking out that she still hasn't found a job. If it didn't hurt so much to cry I would be.

The xray showed something and I was booked in for an MRI and   which showed severe bone loss around both implants.  I have to have 2 full hip replacements asap, 1 at a time though as I need bone grafts on both Having done a bit of research it seems that back in 2012 the MHRA (regulatory agency) recommended annual checks for the life of the implant.

Prior to surgery, I had 4 spinal blocks in my back - none worked - and cortisone shots.  1st 2 cortisone shots didn't work, 3rd one did and it gave me a month pain free. Saw 3 surgeons - one said ""you're hip isn't the problem, it's your spine. The other said ""it's your hip and spine,"" pain doctor said ""it's your sacroiliac joint - I had considered stem cell treatment with him."" Within the year I developed AVN and as I said above, on 12/26/18 I had TRHP. Before surgery I had been going to yoga daily and it helped my back and I used props for my hip. I'm back at yoga, stretching and walking miles again.  Right hip feels great. About a week ago, my left groin started aching, like a tight band was wrapped around it, pain went down the back of my left leg, and my left butt began to hurt. Advil did not help and I saw an ortho right across the street. He put me on the medrol pack but my knee still hurts. I have an appt with a spine doctor this week. I contacted my surgeon and will get an MRI of my left hip in May. He noted that in November 2018 my left hip looked fine, but as I know, things can change rapidly ie, the AVN. He also noted 25% of patients need the other hip done. Have any experienced this, as to me, seems rapid. Or it could be my back but resembles hip. Thanks in advance, Georgette 0 likes, 10 replies "

I started to retain a bit of fluid and it wasn't working so great for my sleep by the 4th week, so she suggested I take it in a more cyclic manner (14 days on/14 off).  I did this and it worked pretty well, except by the 4th week, I was again having some sleep issues, and my periods were coming every 24-25 days instead of 28 like originally. I then found a gynecologist that specialized in BHRT, so figured it couldn't hurt to get her opinion.  She said that although my progesterone was within normal range, I was still estrogen dominant.  She increased the progesterone to 150 mg (compounded this time in a steady release formula).  I noticed an immediate decline in my sleep, very restless.  After about 4 weeks, I noticed I was also retaining more fluid than usual, and my breasts are very sore.  I called my Dr to see if she could call in the immediate release formula, since the pharmacist said that might help with the sleep, and instead, she upped the dosage of the slow release to 200mg to take daily.  Does this make sense?  I am considering switching back to the generic progesterone 100mg,  14 on/14 off and dealing with the one bad week of sleep since it was so good the rest of the time.

Anyone know about them?,"I had a hysterectomy when I was 34, vaginal, leaving the ovaries. then at 37 or 38 I started having the crying and stuff, so doctor put me on the patches, which only stayed stuck on my skin a couple days, so got real expensive changing them out all the time.  Then tried pills, and after trying about 5 different kinds over a period of 4 or 5 years, I gave up. They just didn't work like the patches.   Never knew about weaning off them.  That would have been useful to know...  By then the doctors were all up in the air about the   scare so they didn't want to try anything else on me either.  So I rock along for 15 or so years, feeling like crap, you know, all the same symptoms, plus now I have osteopenia, and had   last year.  And I am just sick of not feeling like myself.  This is no way to live, the sleeplessness (which can cause one to get alzheimer's I have read) and the crying, anger, weight fluxuation, all of it.  For this long.  So my daughter told me they said just kidding about the cancer thing (nobody ever said anything to me?) and maybe I should try them again.  So today I go to the GYN specifically for that and was told that since I had been off for over ten years, that it is ""too dangerous.""  Really?  It is stuff that I had in my body all my life until menopause.  I told her I would rather die than to live this way for the rest of my life.   She just said she was sorry.  Really???   I am 64, and don't feel like I am just here wasting time til I die.  I am a contributing member of society.  She had the nerve to tell me I was too old to start them again, that I just need to take Paxil.  Paxil!!!  That stuff (yes, we went the antidepressant route too) was horrible and I would not give it to anyone ever....  I told her I didn't have a   problem, it is hormonal.  Then she offered some cream for vaginal dryness after I had just told her it was not in use since over a year ago, due to lack of libido from no hormones.  Do they ever listen?  So I called and talked to the nurse at the doctor's office who does the bioidentical hrt with the little sub cutaneous pellets after blood work so they know what I need.  She said there is no reason to feel old if I don't have to.  I told her I don't mind feeling 64, but would like to feel like myself and not feel like a spayed dog.  Do any of y'all have any experience with this?  I am through feeling like this, and am willing to try just about anything at this point.  This nurse practitioner acted like I am just a drain on the system and should just accept feeling like this.  This doctor seems to at least care about the patients, and he does ""men's health"" also.  Any feed back would be much appreciated.  I am glad I found this site, because it is shocking to become aware of all the women going through the same thing and so many doctors just seem to not care.  I thought we had made more progress in society than this..... 4 likes, 52 replies "

I recently returned to my GP, and she said if I am not having the flushes. I might be better off with sertraline this belongs to a group of anti depressant drugs.  I only had a few minutes with my GP the patient before me took some time And felt like this was a quick fix. I do not feel I am depressed.

The estrogen kicked in within 48 hours, I know because I was having premenstrual symptoms as the pharmacy held up my progesterone script and couldn't start that till day 4. All fixed since I started taking the progesterone. The testosterone I didn't notice till day 6 and I must say I am thrilled my libido is back to normal, yay! My menopause symptoms are easing, can't say they are gone but much more manageable already. Dr. said hormones will peak at 3 to 4 weeks and then very gradually wane. She also mentioned that this first time around I may need to come in before 3 months for blood work, hormones may wear off faster. Procedure was mostly painless, the numbing shot hurt more than anything, ironic. As far as a scar, it's the size of a pen mark dot, really nothing 😃 Just wanted to update the group and to any woman in misery thinking about doing the pellets, do your homework ask your questions but so far I am glad I chose this method of HRT.

I wanted to ask anyone who has had this surgery or any professional if they know whether the saggy skin that can be seen in these pictures I attach will go away. I'm concerned about the skin below the testicle and the fold in the middle caused by saggy extra skin at the place where the incision was (there is no visible scar when stretching the skin).

Hydrocele,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/have-hydrocele-weighing-my-options-613293,Have Hydrocele -- Weighing My Options,"I (a 42-year-old male) was diagnosed with a left testicle hydrocele a few months ago and was told I don't need the surgery, but can get it if I ever decide I want it. This website is the only place I've been able to find discussions on this topic, and from what I have read, it doesn't sound like anyone gets amazing results from the surgery. It sounds like most people find that the testicle with the hydrocele ends up being just as big as it was before the surgery, sometimes bigger, plus because of the way it gets stitched up, it doesn't hang normally and has hard spots. Does anyone disagree with this? It occurred to me that people who have better experiences with the surgery may be less likely to post here, i.e., maybe we're more likely to hear from the men who weren't pleased with the post-surgery results. Is there anyone who is highly satisfied with the results of the surgery, especially anyone who had the surgery one or more years ago? I would really like to hear more success stories, if there are any, from men one or more years post-surgery. In all honesty this has been one of the most stressful things I have ever experienced. I find myself ruminating about this all the time, to the point that it's sometimes hard to even think about anything else. I just want this damn thing to go away! I'm debating getting the surgery, but am worried that I may end up worse off based on comments I've read on here. I've yet to see even one before and after picture. I just wish there were more information out there on this. For a while I was thinking about the idea of wrapping something around the hydrocele for a few months to keep it restricted, so that the excess fluid would be forced to be reabsorbed, which would hopefully increase the rate of reabsorption and make the hydrocele go away. I found a device called the Bull Bag made by a company called Perfect Fit; apparently it's a sex toy, but basically it wraps around your balls. I got one and tried it for a day, but it was very uncomfortable, and the testicle with the hydrocele kept coming out. I'm thinking now of maybe trying to constrict the testicle with some kind of cloth underwear device. Currently my left hydrocele is about twice as big as the right one. I really want to get it back to normal. Any comments, feedback, advice, etc., will be very much appreciated. 0 likes, 32 replies "

I feel like it is taking control of my whole life.  I went to a urologist and he did not seem to concerned and did not recommend surgery because it wasn't the size of a softball.  He lined up an ultrasound for me, and when I went for the follow up appointment he told me the hydrocele was minor and  that surgery wouldn't make much of a difference.  He recommended that i wear briefs from now on or a jock strap. I was pretty down after this.  I thought about it for a couple of months and went back to him and requested the surgery.  He said he would do it if that was what I really wanted.  Before I lined up the surgery I chickened out because of the horror stories I read on the internet.  The doctor told me I ""made the right choice"" by changing my mind. Also to be noted:  I have a communicating hydrocele - meaning that when I wake up my nut is closer in size to my normal one and not as saggy.  As the day goes on it gets lower and bigger, especially the more I physically exert myself. I do not know what to do.  I do not want to live like this with a saggy scrotum with more skin than should be there.  I do not want to live the rest of my life like this.  However, I do not want to make things worse by getting the surgery and have something go wrong or have an accumulation of scar tissue of permanent swelling.  I don't want to live like that either.  This is really giving me   and making me depressed.  It is getting in the way of my life in every aspect: socially, physically, professionally, sexually, etc.  It really has me down because I am single and would like to find someone to settle down with.  I don't like looking at myself naked so I don't know who else would.  I live in a smaller community and I'm not trying to have my balls be the center of discussion when people see me what by.  This is making life suck and my self esteem down in the gutter.  My motivation isn't as strong as usual.  I know the hydrocele wont get better by itself.

Hydrocele,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hydrocele-my-experience-670891,Hydrocele- my experience,"I feel compelled to doc my experience here for others to potentially learn from as this forum was very enlightening for me during some very dark times.  I had about 500ml drained, in a pretty smooth procedure. The procedure is the easy part.  I had just day procedure so was home by late afternoon feeling very groggy.  My peen & balls were wrapped up pretty tight in bandaging & the stitches had a dressing over them. During surgery they shaved all my pubes- I guess this was good to save itch whilst it was wrapped.  I was told to not shower for 48hrs so everything held together for that period. I took the bandage off after about 36hrs as the swelling was killing. Swelling pushed into my peen so it was looking quite deformed- don’t stress this is going to be the least of your worries.  Ice yourself as much as physically possible for the first few days.  The dressing came off after my first shower which revealed about 15 desovable stitches some of which had already let go & it was generally looking like a massacre had taken place.  The information pack I was given post surgery said this was all fine & to wear 2 pairs of jocks to support the balls. This is key as you end up with a lot of pain from a pulling feeling between the top of the ball & your body. Obviously everything is readjusting & stretching.  What the information pack didn’t say is to redress the wound. It made sense at the time to let it dry, scab up & heal.  In reality it was torture.  The cut will weep a lot. That weeping is your body forming a scab so it can heal below. When you don’t dress the wound this will fuse to your underwear. Every step, every change of temperature you will feel the scab tear off the most sensitive part of skin on the male body. Removing jocks was excruciating.  I put up with this for 4 days & then changed tacks as it didn’t appear to be getting me anywhere.  Daily I disinfected & dressed the wound with an absorbent silicone dressing. So much better.  But it was a little late as about 7 days post surgery the wound got infected.  I was put on a course of   & had to take the second week off work. Luckily the puss drained & didn’t get locked in. I had about 10 days of antibiotics & by that time it was looking a lot better, the stitches had all released & I was able to gently pluck them out.  A word of warning to watch your posture. Movement is pain so I tended not to move much. A chiropractor told me that my hips were twisted due sitting & sitting incorrectly a lot more than usual.  I was lucky enough to get the trifecta mid the second week. The triple treat- I could sing, dance & act. Infected balls, chronic back pain &  the bonus- gastro. It was undoubtedly the low point of my life. At time of writing, it’s a month post surgery. I still have not had sex- my amazing girlfriend who is a nurse was so good at dressing the wound & helping me although that meant all barriers were broken & she is a bit cautious of reinjury.  My wound is still a little open & where the infection was is still yet to heal over. It looks like a small belly button. There is still some extra swelling & bumps around my testicle it’s slowly going down.   If you are going through this I’d recommend dressing the wound, taking antibiotics as a precaution early on, keeping a healthy posture, sleeping pills to get your rest & having a girlfriend who is a nurse or better yet a doctor. All in all it was worth it.  Good luck!  0 likes, 0 replies "
Hydrocele,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/dont-be-scared-of-hydrocele-surgery-505983,Dont be scared of hydrocele surgery,"I had read some posts regarding hydrocele surgery and was really terrified by the horror stories I read. I finally went in for surgery about 5 weeks back (after holding off for about 3 years). I am glad I finally had my surgery and my recommendation would be to not be scared as long as you are going to a good doctor. So check out the surgeon and make sure he is good before you have surgery. I was scared of going under anesthesia because this was my first time. I have to tell you, that was the best sleep I have ever had. I had no recollection of the time I was under, absolutely no side effects and no pain when I woke up.  As long as your anesthesiologist is good, you have absolutely nothing.  Do yourself a favor. Don't keep putting this surgery off specially if the hydrocele is big. You had better had this surgery when you are young vs when you are a few years older.  The docs will give you sufficient medicine for pain management. I took oxycodone just the day of the surgery and hated it because it made my head go round for an hour or two.  I took advil for the next two days and did not need any more pain medication after that. The surgeon typically loads you with pain medication so you have absolutely no pain for a few hours after the surgery. This is becoming a long post, so let me stop here. I will post more later.  Let me know if you have any questions. 0 likes, 36 replies "

Hydrocele,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hydrocele-surgery-38388,Hydrocele Surgery,"Hello,  I had my hydrocele surgery on February 15th, 2013 in Houston, Texas. I wanted to share my story as I was terrified before having the surgery from all the posts I read.  Mine was on my left side and was about the size of a small grapefruit. I was living with this hydrocele for about a year, but going to the gym started to get quite uncomfortable. I started to show a bulge even in my dress cloths for work. It was quite embarrassing and all I could think about was people staring at me and mumbling ""whats wrong with this guy."" I am married with my first child on the way so I wasn't to worried about what some single guys worry about.  The day of the surgery I was pretty terrified, I work in Healthcare so being on the other side of the privacy curtain was pretty dramatic for me. I wasn't as much scared about the surgery as I was being put to sleep. I am 27 years old, live in Texas with my pregnant wife. My entire family all reside in Indiana, as we moved down to Houston 3 years ago. I kept thinking ""What if I don't wake up?"", ""Ill never meet my kid"", ""I wont get a chance to say goodbye to my family."".... I questioned the anesthesiologist for about 5 straight minutes on what I could expect. They put in an IV and started pumping me full of water to hydrate me. This did calm me down a bit, then they gave me some valium. I highly recommend this before getting put out for anyone, this really calms you down. They rolled me into the surgery part, put a gas mask on me and I was out.  The surgery took about 30 minutes and I woke up about 30 minutes after that. Obviously when you come out of being put to sleep you are very groggy and confused. I couldn't feel any pain. I got dressed and the nurse rolled me to my wifes car and we went home.  I had about 10 stitches (dissolving ones) and a drain tube inserted to help reduce swelling. The first day wasn't bad as everything was numb. When I woke up the second day I had a migraine from hell. Probably from all the drugs the day before. It was hard to walk, but I didn't have any problems peeing.  The third day the pain started to come, honestly the stitches never hurt from beginning to where I am now. The pain I had was from the drain tube. Do not be alarmed when you have a lot of blood from the drain tube for the first 3-4 days, its normal. My surgery was on Friday and the drain tube was removed on Monday.  Swelling. Lots of swelling, expect this. Swelling will most likely be bigger than what the hydrocele was before it was removed. Looked like I was carrying around a softball in my pants. It has been three weeks and the stitches are gone and the drain tube hole is closing. I still have some pain from where the drain tube was, but not to bad. I am walking fine and going back to the gym tomorrow. Swelling has gone down, but still noticable. Feels like a hard rock sitting on top of my testicle. You have to remember, the testicles and sac are very vascular. Lots of tissue and what not so you will have swelling and bruising.  The swelling is smaller now than the original hydrocele and it can take a few months to fully go away. They say people can live with a hydrocele with no long term effects other than it getting bigger, but honestly, why would you want to do this? It's not normal, so why risk anything by just accepting that it is there. Get the surgery done and move on. You will be laid out for about 4 days. I was back to work on Tuesday (Surgery on Friday). Let me know if you have any other questions, don't read into all the horror stories. Everybody's body is different and if you have a solid doctor, they will take care of you.  I was asked about costs. I am on a high deductible plan with my wife to keep our monthly premium low as we are pretty healthy people. The doctor fee was $350. The surgery center is where it gets you. For everything it was $4,900. So in total for me out of pocket was $5,200. Fortuantely I have a HSA account and had the finances in that which are all tax deductible. Just depends on the type of insurance you have. My deductible is now met, so with the little one being born all doctors visits will be paid 100% in full for the rest of the year.  Also- Find a good doctor. It's your body, so always get a second opinion. Make sure you are comfortable with the Urologist Good luck Matt  8 likes, 135 replies "

My op was textbook from start to finish.  Under general anesthetic for about 45 mins. Came round very easily and was enjoying a turkey sandwich and cup of coffee less than  an hour later! Pain was about 4 out of 10 at most and I took only paracetamol thru out my stay in hospital (day release) and for the 2 weeks I had off work. 'Down  below' was very swollen and purple coloured. First 10 days after the op I had a near constant dull ache like pain in the left side of my groin, where the hydrocele  had been.  Plus occasional sharp stabbing pains on my right side, where the incision was made. I applied ice constantly, which immediately eased both types of pain.  Took paracetamol thru out the day, which also helped. I purchased a sports jock strap, which really kept things tight and secure! Much better than the tight trunks the hospital recommended! Towards the end of 2 weeks post op, I gradually realised the pain had virtually gone and stopped needing the paracetamol. 15 days post op and the swelling was much reduced and I no longer needed the jock strap. Back to work tomorrow, happy the op has been a success! 0 likes, 2 replies "

I foolishly underwent a hydrocelectomy surgery for no good reason. I had an unresolved case of epididymo orchitis (which i still have)  and a hydrocele on the same testicle. It is now one month after my operation and i have been advised to wait up to 6 months to heal. Here are my problems. 1. My penis is shrinking. The muscles simply have lost the will to live. I noticed a few days ago that i could only get about 70% erect. I am no longer reaching my full capacity.. but not just this, I feel as though my penis is smaller. The inner muscles feel tighter and my shaft skin appears to fit my shaft differently. I can't quite remember how I used to look but something very odd is going on with my penis now. 2. They stitched they ball/spermatic cord to the wall of my scrotum?! What the f**k? If i had known this then i never would have had the operation. I also notice when i try to get erect that my balls feel super tingly (not in a good way) and then the cords linking my penis and balls feel very tight and straight like i have these long thin rods attempting to fit inside a basically flaccid penis.. oh but it's not just flaccid. It all just feels so different. Please if anyone has experienced this post op, talk to me! Thank you 0 likes, 4 replies "

Hydrocele,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hydrocele-surgery-gave-me-erectile-dysfunction-am-i-the-only-one--690535,Hydrocele surgery gave me erectile dysfunction. Am I the only one?,"So, I had a hydrocelectomy operation around July 2018. About a month after my operation, around the time the swelling began to go down (and notably, around the time I began having sex again and masturbating), I began noticing that my penis would not get as firm as it once did. I also noticed that when I ejaculate it no longer shoots out, it dribbles. This has been extremely unsatisfying and my condition has gotten much worse. I can sometimes maintain an erection but it is a challenge now and I literally have not had a morning erection since about a month after the operation. My urologists told me it has absolutely nothing to do with the operation which I absolutely refuse to believe. So I have hit a dead end in terms of getting professional help now. I would like to ask you all, has anyone experienced this and gotten a different response from their urologist? i.e it is possible that the operation can cause this. I myself can feel a thick, swollen tube like structure inside my scrotum that runs from the root of my penis to my balls and I'm sure I could never feel it before the operation. My urologists gave me an examination and told me it's all good and the tubes were not even touched during the operation. Am I wrong for thinking that is utter BS because y'know, balls are attached to a few tubes, move the balls and remove it's surrounding membrane, there is a chance it could affect connecting features, no? Urologist says zero chance. A couple more questions. Where exactly was your incision made? Mine was directly down the center line of the scrotum about halfway down. Has anyone else here got cysts on their operated testicle? I have 3 or 4 including one on my epidymis. I also was diagnosed with epididymo-orchitis prior to surgery with no actual conclusion as to why, or how to make it better. Please can people comment who have experienced this or something similar post hydrocele surgery. I would seriously appreciate anyone who has any insight that could save me!

Headache,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/constant-head-pressure-head-feels-fatigued-spaced-out-601328,Constant head pressure/head feels fatigued/Spaced out,"Back in December, I experienced the worst  /  of my life. It was a feeling of undescribable head pressure(I describe it as fluid surrounding my head). Pressure/headache in the eyes was really terrible. When I thought I was feeling a bit better and got up to move around, the head pressure would return and I had to lay back down. This lasted 2-3 days. I thought I would recover, but I've never felt the same since... And I'm only 28. No prior health issues to this. I have a 5 year old daughter and to be honest, this is completely ruining my life. The head pressure has never gone away. The head pressure was so bad on and off for the first 4 months I literally thought I had brain swelling(that's how it made me feel). It felt as if someone was moving my brain around. It's as if your head is fatigued from working too hard and it's in a constant state of shaking. A very weird, undescribable, uncomfortable, scary feeling. I had really bad brain fog. I would have moments where I would space out so bad I felt as if I was in a dream for the majority of those months. So detached. I still have those moments. Everyday I wake up, I have head pressure(blood shot eyes). My ears feel the need to pop deep inside the cavity. Uncomfortable and unease feeling of my head(like it's fatigued) is the feeling that makes it the worst. My head feels clogged and I espcially feel it in the surrounding portion of my back eyes, ears and head. I don't ever feel normal. There might be a relief of head fatigue from time to time, but my head has never felt the same. The only thing that makes me feel somewhat normal is if I lay down.  In the beginning 4 months, putting on hats, listening to loud music, over the ear headphones only made my head pressure worse and give me terrible headaches for the remaning day in the begining.  Went to the ER twice the first few months for the head pressure symptoms and followed up with my primary care doctor. They all said stress but ultimately was referred to a neurologist, ENT & Eye Doctor to cover my basis. I've had an MRI of the brain with and without contrast done. Only thing that revealed was a few mucus cyst(which are normal I guess). I've had a panel of blood work ran which all came back normal. Checked for Thyroid function, blood count and few other things. Had a   done of my sinus(no prior sinus or allergy issues in my life) and pending results on that. Not really optimistic it's going to show anything. I don't know what to do at this point. I truthfully feel hopeless.. I need help 4 likes, 46 replies "

Before i start with my story i need to tell you that I'm taking anti depressants and anti psychotics for the last 2 years. 3 months ago i started to have  , most exactly on my right side, the pain was persistent for 2 weeks after i decided to go to the doctor. After doing every test (EKG, X-Ray of chest, blood pressure,  , urine tests) everything came normal, i am on the paper perfectly healthy. The doctor said it's probably from the depression and i should talk with my shrink. I went to my shrink and he just said i should take 40 mg of citalopram instead of the 20 mg i was taking. So i did, and the pain in my chest did go away. After that i started to increase citalopram from 20 mg to 30 mg for a week, then i started to have a headache for a week and i got blurry vision if i was looking at bright lights in the night. For example i would feel really sensitive about lights in the supermarkets. I go immediately to my doctor where she said i should check up my eyes because it's maybe because of that that i have headaches and blurry vision. So i go to the ophthalmologist and they do their tests, and the result came totally fine, my eyes and vision is in perfect condition. So after that the headache goes away but a mild pressure in my head stays and is persistent. With that i got buzzing in my right ear, like a tinnitus. For a few days i also head totally foggy brain and it was really horrible. The fogginess  went away after few days, but the mild head pressure and tinnitus stayed. After 2 days later  i got morning anxiety, something that i never had and it went sometimes over the whole day, sometimes just in the morning. The anxiety went away, but the other symptoms stayed. So now after a month i still have this mild pressure in my head and buzzing in my right ear. I was again at my doctor, she said it's psychological and doesn't want to send me to any other tests. What i found out is when i drink 1-2 beers my pressure in my head goes away, but drinking alcohol is not the answer for my pain. Over the weekends when i sleep well and have no work pressure i don't feel the pressure. Did anybody had similar problems or anything like that? Will i find a cure for my pain? 0 likes, 1 reply "

For about 7 days now I've had a strange pressure type felling in the right side of my head. It seemed to begin behind my eye, but then seemed to settle in the right temple for a few days. But for the last couple of days it's been in the back right side of my head. I wouldn't call it a pain, but pressure. I feel like that's an important distinction? I've tried to take pain killers but they don't seem to help. My doctors office can't see me for another week so I'm left to fend for myself until my appointment. If I'm completely honest I'm deathly afraid that I have a brain tumor. And I'm in a weird way happy to wait to go to the doctors office. I've only last week turned 26 and up til now everything in my life was going well for a change. It would destroy me if the worst should happen. I've had someone say that it could be a  , I've had another say it could be a head cold and catarrh. Ive been told it might be a nerve thing. Another person suggested I could simply need glasses. But I always worry about the worst outcome I can't help it, I'm a worrier. A few times I've felt a sort of tingly feeling radiate into the right side of my face, I'm not sure if that's important? My speech hasn't been slurred, nor have I lost any coordination. I haven't had any seizures either or the typical things you think of with a brain tumour, just the head ache. It doesn't seem to get better or worse no matter what I've tried. My vision  is also ok I think. If anything Ive sometines got some floaters but that's nothing new for me. I need people to tell me that I'm overreacting and need to stop worrying, but if anyone can offer me some advice that would be great. Maybe if anyone has been in my position before and can give me some insight. Thanks, Andrew 2 likes, 26 replies "

Headache,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/pressure-in-head-within-nose-cavity-449950,Pressure in head within nose cavity,"I have had this pressure that eminates from the sinus or cavities behind the nose for about 4 months now. It started gradually and now is a constant pressure that causes lightheadindness /   and headaches. it gets worse when I move or do anything physical, especially when I move my head down. I know it is trapped air that is causing the problem, it's as if i have sinusitus and i'm on a plan. Popping my ears helps reduce the pressure for a few minutes but it tends to build back up again. 4 weeks ago whilst feeling particularly pressurised I popped my ears whilst yawning and pulling my left ear, what happened next doctors have a hard time believing. Loads of air came out of my left ear, as if like sticking a nail in a bike tire. This lasted for between 20-30 seconds. afterwards, I felt great, no head pressure, no headaches, no dizziness. I think this could well be a breakthrough for a lot of head pressure cases I read on the net. For that day I had my life back, sadly the next day it just seemed to build up again. The problem is that there doesn't seem to be much research out there on this and it is very hard to live with it. I would say its like a constant uncomfortableness and pain about 3/4 out of 10. When moving this increases and I have had some really bad 10 out of 10 headaches. i'm interested in other people who have experienced similar sympotoms and what the outcome was. This does seem curable, but ENTs don't seem to know anything about it. I'm positive this can get resolved in the future but its up to people who are suffering with this to get this condition out there and into public knowledge. 0 likes, 15 replies "

For the last 3.5 years now I've had a bunch of symptoms that are impacting my daily life. I was born three months early, and as a result I have a medical condition called (Spastic)  , due to a brain bleed before birth. Due to the Cerebral Palsy the left side of my body was affected, and my left leg is slightly shorter than the right causing me to limp when I walk. My nightmare began one night in October of 2015 when I started getting severe headaches and brain fog. At that time those were my only two symptoms. I went to see a Neurologist that prescribed me with ""Baclofen"" a muscle relaxer that seemed to have no effects on the Headaches or the Brain Fog so I stopped taking it.  During this time I had lots of pain in my Trapezius muscles in my neck on both sides and began therapy to stretch those muscles. That lessened the frequency of the headaches but they still occurred. I was able to live with that for awhile.  Sometime in 2016 I started to get this Lightheaded feeling off and on sometimes with a bit of a cold sweat and nauseousness, symptoms seemed to worsen with physical activity. Sometimes I would get nauseous and lightheaded without the  . Another year goes by and 2017 comes. Now the nauseousness comes and goes daily sometimes with or without being lightheaded and I'm diagnosed  with ""Gerd"". I started taking Nexium and have switched to Omeprazole  up to this point. If I don't take the medicine I get bad heartburn along with the nauseousness. The acid reflex medicine seems to lessen the nauseousness, but not fully get rid of it. I've gone for a CAT scan,  ,  EKG's, an EEG of the brain, an   of the head and neck, a lymes disease test. Everything looked ""Perfect"" except on my MRI scan of the neck where I have a fissure in two of the disks in my neck. Fast forward to February of 2019 with my latest symptom of Vertigo, sometimes with or without what I think is a ""tension headache"" I have pain on the top of my head in the front and on my forehead with Vertigo, sometimes with or without nauseousness. Sometimes I will be walking and it feels like the floor is falling or bouncing. Sometimes when I lean over the sink to wash my hands it feels like I am doing a front flip while i'm standing there, its such a weird vertigo sensation. It can also occur while i'm standing up, sometimes I feel like my body if falling forward while standing still. I have been to 3 chiropractors on and off for the last  year, and they all seem to agree that I have forward head posture. Hopefully there is someone out there who has been through something similar before who can offer help. At 22 years old it feels like my life is ending. Matt 0 likes, 1 reply "

Since I never get headaches (I have no idea what a   feels like), at first I thought it would go away on its own. It didn't, I only felt relief after taking one ibuprofen ( 200mg pill). Six days after my headaches began, I got a cold. Typical symptoms - runny nose, headache (different type), achy body. I treated it with OTC medication and ibuprofen to alleviate  . Four days later I felt better, and since I wasn't regularly taking cold medicine I realized I still had a mystery headache. Fast forward a week, I went to my Dr. and she said I possibly had a sinus infection. I was a bit skeptical, can someone have sinus headaches six days before feeling symptoms of a cold? But I went with her plan anyway and got my prescription for three days of   (prednisone)  and ten days of  . While on steroids I didn't have headache in the morning and the afternoon, but by evening I had to take ibuprofen to alleviate the pain. By day seven it was obvious that I never had a sinus infection, so I scheduled a follow up appointment. At my second appointment the Dr. told me that my headache didn't match any of the symptoms that associate with migraines, cluster or tensions headaches. At this point I need an MRI, and if something doesn't look right a referral to a neurologist. So far I've been waiting for a week for my insurance to approve MRI. No answer and I don't know what to do and what steps I can take next. I have no idea how much longer it will take to hear back from the insurance company. I've been calling Dr's office almost every day for an update, they just keep telling me the request is pending. Anyone else has similar symptoms or advice on what I should do next? Is getting MRI so soon drastic? It seems it escalated fast - first I had sinus infection, next thing I know I need MRI. I'm so lost... Here are more details about my symptoms: Headache goes away every time I take ibuprofen. Most of the time one pill does the trick, occasionally I have to take two pills. In 24 hour period I take medication three times (approx  every 8 hours). Headache comes on gradually, usually it takes 15 minutes. Throbbing pain above right eye, on scale of 1-10 I would say it's a 5 but it bothered me enough to make me cry.

I have been suffering with the symptoms in the title pretty consistently for about 2 and a half years now. I used to have some relief from the symptoms for a day or 2 here and there or maybe a bit of relief for a few hours in the day but recently the symptoms are pretty much constant and I cannot shake them.  I have an overall mild pressure feeling in the head, its not painful but is just very aggravating and feels really strange. I also have extreme brain fog with this and like a fuzzy head, there is a constant cloud over my brain and I never have any mental clarity or a clear head. My cognitive function is extremely poor now, my short term memory is non existent, its scarily bad. I often feel, detached from reality when the symptoms are bad and suffer from de-realisation, although I think this may be down to some anxiety and depression I experience when the symptoms run me down. I also get random sharp cramping pains in the head, they are quite painful but do not bother me so much as they only usually last a second or 2, it varies on how many I get of these each day but its usually less than 5. It often feels as though my brain is malfunctioning somehow and my cognitive function and senses are all out of whack, its hard to explain. There can sometimes be a build up of these symptoms throughout the day and by the night I can feel like I somehow how the flu without a fever? Like I have the head pressure, completely foggy headed, I feel super unwell, weak, sometimes even start feeling cold. Also have night sweats usually for about 4 or 5 days each month, there doesnt seem to be any sort of pattern to them that I can notice, so not sure if they are relevant. Another thing I have is ringing in ears which is mild but seems to have gotten worse recently if that sounds relevant at all. The main thing that gets me is the odd head pressure/sensation and the utterly life hindering brain fog, my brain feels like it is coated in a dark blanket constantly. I do suffer from anxiety, I know many of these symptoms can be caused or made worse by these symptoms. I dont doubt that anxiety is a contributing factor and the way I think about they symptoms probably makes them worse but I have come a long long way with my anxiety, I have good control over it, I haven't had a panic attack in a couple of years, I manage to control most of my concious anxiety and stay in a positive mindset. No doubt I still have some subconscious anxiety underlying and I am working on that but I am not convinced this is the route cause of my symptoms. I am in therapy for my anxiety. I do not feel I will ever fully recover while I have these symptoms hanging over me though.  I have been to the doctor about these symptoms, although I do think I struggle to explain them or put them across very well in the doctors office. I have have blood tests which are all normal. I saw a neurologist couple of years back when this started, had a CT scan which was normal, they put the stabbing pains down to icepick headaches and thought the other symptoms were probably made worse by my anx/depression. Since then I went away and have been on anti depressants etc with no improvement of symptoms. I have also had a few ECGs and a 24hr ECG as I have slow heart rate and low bp so thought maybe the symptoms could be down to low bp and lack of blood to the brain, doctors do not think think this is the case and all my results came back normal. I have recently been back to the neurologist who is referring me for an MRI although he said he is sure there is nothing sinister and thinks the symptoms are probably tension type headaches and made worse by and previous drug use, he only put it down to the drug use when i told him about it though so it seemed like a convenient diagnosis. I forgot to mention I used to take drugs on the weekends socially, cocaine, ketamine and ecstasy on different occasions for a couple of years, I have had periods where I have felt ok since taking these drugs and do not really think they are the cause, I was not an addict this was just one or 2 nights a month at the weekends. So I have an MRI coming up but the neuro thinks it will be clear and obviously I hope it is and I am looking for other answers.  What could be causing these symptoms? Other than anxiety which i no can be a factor, but I have periods where my anxiety is pretty much non existent but these symptoms still build up out of nowhere and persist. I was thinking maybe some sort of allergy could be a possibility, I have tried cutting out gluten and lactose, this didn't seem to make much difference although I didn't stick to this for very long. I actually did a juice fast for 2 weeks with eating nothing other than fruit and veg juice put through a juicer to see if that would help but it didn't really give me any relief. Are there any other stomach issues that could cause this? I never have diarrhoea or constipation, my stools always float recently though, to the point of not being able to flush them, also whenever I have seen chance medicine doctors they check me out and say they think i have issues with digestion, i don't feel i have these issues but do wonder if there might be something in it.  Could there be something going on with the blood vessels in my head? Could it be a spine/posture issue? Some sort of epilepsy or electrical activity in my brain? I just have no idea now and am desperate for some relief. If anyone has any ideas or advice I would really appreciate it.  Oh just to add I am reasonably fit, I try go to the gym a few times a week and I do some weight lifting. I am a normal weight. I have been losing some weight recently which is a concern but I am still in a normal weight range for height and age.  Thanks for reading 44 likes, 1076 replies "

Headache,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/spaced-out-high-drunk-feeling-please-help-me-5-months--512915,"Spaced out, high, Drunk Feeling. Please help me. (5 MONTHS)  ","Hi everyone. My name is Erik. I am a 20 year old male, thin build. 6' 2'' at 170 lbs. I have had really debilitating issues for the last 5 months. The issue is that I feel drunk, spacey, loopy, high and dizzy all the time. It basically feels the same as if you were tipsy or the high feeling you can get. I also have visual disturbances. My vision has become blurry and I have somewhat tunnel vision. I just feel all around out of it. I find myself daydream, when I say this I mean my eyes don't focus on anything (go blurry) and just look at nothing. I think it might be slight double vision. Sounds are also very werid and it takes alot of energy to focus on visual and audio stimulants. Additionally, I am tired all the time. Extremely tired. Some days I will sleep very well for 10-11 hours and still be tired when I wake up and exercise will not wake me up. It is like the type of good solid sleep you have when your body is sick.. My memory has gotten really bad as well as my ability to process thoughts and engage in conversation. Imagine being drunk all the time...first I have been reading on boards like this for a long time now and have seen some people with these symptoms but no answers!! People seem to disappear. I hope hey have solved this problem but please let me know how! Let me start by giving some background information. In August 2015 I was in an indoor rock climbing gym and fell from 15 feet straight onto my back. I could not move for a good 15 minutes because it hurt so bad. I wasn't able to do anything athletic after that day for at least a month. However, I did not have my current symptoms after this fall.  Fast forward to December 15th 2015. I got really sick, was in bed for 4 days. Sore throat, eyes hurt like crazy, and super tired. It was during and after these 4 days that I developed a headache. This headache causes a pressure/dull/sharp pain behind my eyes, the upper bridge of my nose and right in between my eyes on my forehead. This headache lasted for about 4 months.  At about 3 weeks into the headache I went and saw an ENT as I thought it was a sinus infection. i took multiple sets of antibiotics over the course of the next month to no avail. I got blood tests and liver test at around 2 months into the headache and nothing showed abnormal. I then was able to get into a nuerologist. They were unable to find anything after taking an MRI of my head with a barium contrast.  Since the beginning of my headache I have been seeing a (PT) physical therapist mostly for my neck and back since after the fall my back is sore constantly. I had a neck injury about 5 years ago on a trampoline so I have a sore neck, tight muscles alot from that.  At about 3 months into the headache (3/15/2015) I developed a new symptom, the drunk/high, dizziness, loopiness. I had the headache at the same time at this point. My PT suggested that I may have a blood vessel being pinched in my neck or a nerve being pinched in my mid back area where my rock climbing fall pain is mostly at. I have been to 3 different chiropractors since this has occured about 5 times to each one. It has not helped so far. My PT gave me massages in my affected back and neck areas.  Also a new thing I've noticed recently is that when I look up (bend my neck to look at the sky) I seem to get some sort of relief? Also ever since the loopy part started (this did not happen when I just had the headache) any amount of alcohol at all will make me SUPER DRUNK, literally like 2 sips. I used to be able to drink 3 full beers before getting buzzed. I am thinking I want my doctor to give me a full head (brain/upper atlas) to lower back (tailbone) MRI so that my nerves and blood vessels going to my brain can be evaluated. Do you think this is a good idea? Has anyone had these symptoms before? I am now 5 months into this and it is debilitating.  No doctor is taking me seriously because I am so young and the chances of having a serious problem are supposedly slim because of my age. PLEASE HELP!!! I feel like I'm caught in a dream and losing my awareness and my IQ. I am afraid something is damaging my brain and this is going to be permanent. 2 likes, 45 replies "

You see it always feels like the area around and at my temples is being squeezed by something sharp. And quite often I get sharp spikes of pain in that area as well. And this is on the good days. You see I have found something that has helped me, and it confuses me a great deal. That is learning, or using my brain intensely in some fashion such as math, or my favorite way, programming. You see when I am programming or doing some similar brain intense activity my symptoms lessen, the sharp spikes go away and the pressure in my temples feels as though it loosens. And the most important thing is it brightens my mood. You see one thing I failed to mention is that with the pain, if I have gone a long time without a brain intense activity my mood becomes horrible, I become completely unsocial, unable to muster any normal response to anything, and/or I become extremely anxious sometimes to the point that I feel as though I cannot breath and/or I become extremely agitated at the smallest things. And if I go long enough without any brain activities the sharpness increases at the sides of my head, get more painful, and even at times go to the back of my head.  And these brain activities help, they make the worst symptoms go away, I can steal feel the pressure, and I still get the  , but at least for the period I am doing them and a little time afterward, I feel alright. So it has almost become an obsession for me, to get home and do something brain intense. I am constantly thinking about the next time I can go home and program when I am away, it's almost to the point where I don't even know if I like programming anymore, or if I just do it to get rid of the symptoms. I don't like living like this. I want to be able to go on a week trip somewhere and not live every moment in pain and be a complete unsocial, anxiety ridden mess. I want to do other things other than the brain stuff, without preparing my self for pain. I don't understand any of it. The doctor thinks it's neck pressure and I am currently trying anti-inflammatory drugs (just started), not sure if they work yet.  My family thinks its part of my sinus problems, since I've always had those. Honestly I don't know anymore. If anyone reading this has the slightest idea of what might help, or what it might be please say something, I am open to anything you have to say. I really want some hope. 0 likes, 4 replies "

I have suffered health anxiety for the last few years now mostly concerning my heart and my brain. I have been suffering from what I thought was migraines since last summer. I went to the neurologist at least three times last year and they did two CT scans on me which all came back clear. I had what felt like the worst   of my life along with a lot of   symptoms. my neurologist did not want to give me an MRI but finally did about a month ago. well I finally got the results today because of phone tag issues and it turns out that I do have what's called a incidental    brain tumor. no words can describe how I feel and how angry I am but nobody believed me for the longest time that something was wrong and all this time there was. they have referred me to a neurosurgeon to see what the next step is going to be. so if I have one piece of advice for anybody who is suffering with headaches is to please please get what you need to find out what is going on with your body. next is is there anybody anybody who has any experience with this type of tumor? I have no idea how long it's going to be until I get into the neurosurgeon to get all the answers I need to my questions and I absolutely will not Google anymore! thank you for reading this long post! 0 likes, 3 replies "

Hemifacial Spasm,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-hemifacial-spams-are-gone-without-surgery--498514,My hemifacial spams are gone without surgery!,"I'm a 51 year old guy.  (Irish/Italian/French/English) descent. I've had hemi facial spasms since age 40. At first it was a slight twitch on my eye.  Then, the whole eye was closing with my left side of my mouth and cheek muscles moving. (If you are here on these forums... you know the deal...) Since I was 40, I've been getting botox shots to control the spasms. The twitching was almost non-existant.  I could tell it was still happening because I could hear in my left ear a sort of sheesh, sheesh, sheesh noise.  (sounded like a quick static-like ocean sound) Then... maybe November or so I noticed the noise wasn't happening. I'd learned to block it out, so I had to pay attention. It's now February and my last botox was in October I think.  I was supposed to get another shot in January but I told the doc to postpone it. My smile is back.  My eyebrow doesn't twitch.  My eye , face and mouth arent twitching.   What gives?  I thought only surgury could cure this. So you are probably wondering... what did I do recently that may have helped it?  Now, I'm not saying this did it, but in the last two years I've done some things differently. For the past year and a half Ive' been: 1) I started excercising.  My cholesterol was going up, so I started the treadmill every other day for 1/2 hour. 2) I hear Krill oil lowers cholesterol so I've been taking 1000mg every morning.  Never miss a dose.  It thins blood. 3) My blood pressure was going up a little so I started taking L-Citrulline which open blood vessels.  (about 2.4grams in the morning and again at night)  L-Citrulline gets converted into nitrous oxide in the body. Body builders use it to expand blood vessels before working out or running a marathon.  So maybe that was the thing.... not sure..... I read nitrous oxide levels decease as we get older.  Maybe that's why hemi-facial spams affects more people over 40?  When women enter menopause, the nitrous oxide level drop. So, again, I'm not a doctor.... I can only tell you what I've done differently.  Maybe there's no correlation? Dunno. I'm soooooo glad to see me in the mirror again. If posting this actually helps someone, that would be great. IMPORTANT!  I did research those suppliments before I took them and they will interact with some heart medications or erectile drugs... MAKE SURE YOU LOOK INTO ANY DRUG INTERACTIONS BEFORE TRYING ANYTHING PLEASE. Good luck! Dan. 4 likes, 61 replies "

After researching the internet for causes and treatment, I stumbling upon this forum and was reading multiple posts about 4 years ago in which a person named ""windhur"" posted his discoveries which helped him.   He concluded that his neck was causing the problem.  I was thrilled to hear this as I was telling my doctors that I am 95%  sure  my neck is contributing to this facial spasm.  I had three whiplash injuries to my neck, a right shoulder that dislocates anteriorly for the last twenty years and extreme neck tightness especially the right side.  I have started doing stretches with heat and massage to the neck area  concentrating on the right side with postural excercises to correct bad posture. (text neck ).  I have had no botox treatments.   I have also  starting wearing special glasses that filter outs the harmful rays of light because of sensitivity to lights and noise (I also suffer from   with  )  and have had a 80% improvement in my hemispasm. I am concluding for myself that my neck is playing a huge part in this disorder.  I would love to get in touch with this person by the name of ""Windhur""  who also stated that the neck played a part in his disorder and for any feedback since this persons postings and to see the progess today.

I think they occurred due to the braces. But now I am braces free for a year and half. However, Recently I been experiencing some eye twitching, it's on the left outer corner of my left eye. It's been twitching for a while now, I would say a week or two and it doesnt seem to be going away!! ALL DAY EVERY DAY EVEN DURING SLEEP I CAN FEEL IT. I can feel it twitching but if people dont look closely, they wont notice it. I been looking at it in the mirror and I am able to see the flickering/twitching on the exact same spot every time! The frequency been the same but I feel like the magnitude has gone down.. I went to the doctor and just like every other family doctors, he told me i was tired and stress and blah blah blah. Thing is, I am not a coffee drinker, do not smoke, sleep at 10pm with 8 hours (or more sometimes) of sleep. I mean there is nothing really related to stress in my life except for this twitching! I realized the twitching is more noticable when i lay down, when I try to go to bed. But once i sit up, it's not as strong anymore. Here is a picture of the location of the twitching My doctor even told me he has seen people like my age (29) coming with twitching for a month or so and never seen those people again. So they their twitch probably had resolved on its own. I am really nervous and helpless guys. He wont think it is HFS and wont let me see a neurologist because they think if it was HFS, there would be more symptoms, instead of just having a little eye twitch. I have already told them a lot of things start with small thing but he thinks im too nervous. Please gimme some ideas guys! I really need your help.

Henoch-Schonlein Purpura,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/suffering-with-hsp-259497,suffering with HSP ,"I was diagnosed with henoch-schonlein purpura (HSP) in March 2014.  It started off with little red spots appearing on my legs and tummy, and with working in a nursery I assumed it was just chicken pox.  The next day I went to see my local GP to be told it was just an allergic reaction and was given hydrocortisone cream and anti-histamines to take to relief the itch.  By the time I got home from the GP the rash was now, everywhere! And putting the cream on it felt like my skin was literally on fire! Come that night my knees and ankles were swollen and all my joints were in agony! I returned to the GP the following day who then sent me to the local A&E to get bloods checked.  I was then admitted to the hospital overnight where I seen Dermatology and the Renal unit as there were abnormalities with my Kidney Function in my blood tests and Dermatology performed a biopsy to get a definite diagnosis of HSP.  I was then discharged with loads of lotions and potions for my skin and told I would be fine within a week.  2 days after being discharged I started being sick constantly, I couldn’t even hold down a sip of water and I had an excruciating pain in my stomach! I ended up back in the hospital, this time with abnormalities in my liver and my rash began to turn into open sores which meant I had to be put on steroids to take down the inflammation on the skin and to help with my liver.  After a week of being in the hospital I got discharged again, even though I was still being sick and couldn’t hold a thing down! After only just a day of being at home, things seemed to go from bad to worse! I literally could not move with the pain in my back and abdomen, and was still being sick, so I got taken up to the hospital again.  This time, I was admitted to a surgical ward as they thought it could be ‘intercusseption’ which apparently is pretty common in HSP.  With HSP being more common in children, nobody was able to give myself or my parents any answers as to when this was all going to stop, it was a nightmare! My mum ended up getting more information from sites like this, than from the doctors! At this point we came to realise we were just going to have to take it as it comes and deal with things as they cropped up.  On further investigation by the Surgical team from this hospital admission they realised I had inflammation of the small bowel and pancreatitis which explained why I was in so much pain! As everything on the inside was getting worse, so was everything on the outside! My hands began to swell to the extent  of I couldn’t even pick up tablets to take them and I struggled to walk my ankles had swollen so much! The rash also got worse and I ended up having to wear bandages everywhere and was basically, well, mummified! With my bowel being inflamed, it caused me to bleed, a lot! One minute id be fine and the next id be covered in blood, jammies, bedsheets, the lot! For an 18 year old, this was pretty hard to deal with, I felt like I was a fit and healthy teenager trapped inside an elderly persons body, I was just so weak and couldn’t do anything for myself! This went on for 2 weeks straight, and the pain was unbearable, morphine was definitely a life saver!  Things finally settled down and I was able to eat again and eventually got discharged.  However, this was far from the end! At an outpatients appointment to the Renal Unit we discovered my protein levels were up at 250 instead of being between 30 and 50 and my blood was sitting at 3+++  in my urine! I got started on a higher dose of steroids as they assumed it was just inflammation of my kidneys and hoped for the best.  2 months on and I am still on steroids and have lasting scars on my legs, so much so I refuse to wear my little dresses and shorts for going out in the sun! I am still unable to work as the steroids suppress the immune system even more and I am still in a lot of pain with the lasting problems with my kidneys! I have written my story as I felt that when I was dealing with everything, nobody, not even doctors had the answers as to what was going to go wrong next, simply because HSP isn’t common in Adults.  I hope this story helps and gives someone the guidance that I didn’t really have while I was ill.   1 like, 18 replies "

On the 28TH of February this year I woke up with abdominal pain i thought nothing of it at first but as the day progressed it got worse and worse so bad it was unbearable and I couldnt even walk straight it wasnt the type of pain either that gave you a break it was everlasting and very weakening.2 days later when I couldnt bear it any longer I attended the A AND E Dept in waterford Regional Hospital where Im from in Ireland.They Told me that it was infact a ''knotting of my stomach'' and the prescribed me with medication.I had infact at the time of my examination already developed signs of a rash on my legs and feet.   2 days later from that and no better I got very sick during the night,at this stage I was vomiting and the rash had got much more agressive covering my legs and also the end of my back which was the worse of all.My family became very concerned so during the night I travelled to a care doc. The care doc was puzzled as to what was wrong and could not find anything wrong with my stomach on examination so gave me different medication and told me to go home and have a hot choclate!   Days dragged on and I was feeling worse and worse I was sweating one minute and cold the next I got so weak I could not move from my bed.The third time a doctor was called. The doctor took my blood pressure and was astonished as to how high it was for my age,she examined me and on examination she called for my parents to call an ambulance straight away..she diagnosed me with mengicocal menengitis and gave me 3 injections of anti biotics..the ambulance rushed me to hospital where I spent a week and where they confirmed it was not menengitis but a viral infection.They killed the pain with painkillers and told me there was nothing else for what I had only that it had to go by itself.I was left out the following week as the rash had faded and I was in no more pain but felt very weak.   It wasnt long I was home and the rash started up again folowed by the abdominal pain,as the days went on I deteriated once again and another doctor came as I could not move from the house as this time my joints had become inflamed and my knee was twice its size. It was only this time that the doctor that visitied diagnosed my disease for what it really is.HSP.He recognised it by the rash and asked me if it has started at the end of my back,which it did. He said that I needed to be hospitalised in order for the pain to be controlled and I needed Steroids as a last resort.However he said that I did not need to go there till the next morning as the only worry was my kidneys with this disease and that in itself would take years if they were to be affected. The next mornin I returned to hospital again along with the doctors letter and its only then they confirmed that I had this disease. They sent me home with a small dose of steroids but the following week the dermatologist took me off them as symptoms were dying down.   The following week to no surprise I woke up during the night with rash on my legs and stomach pains I tried my best to leave it go by itself with painkillers but it just got worse and worse and ANOTHER doctor was called.The doctor took my blood pressure and said that it was dangerously high and called another ambulance.   all that night in the hospital i was vomiting I hadnt slept in days and i thought id never sleep again the pain in my stomach was so bad and nothing would take it away.I could not go to the loo without the aid of someone with me as i was so weak shakey and dizzy.However I was greatful the swelling had not come back. After 3 days of no sleep and constant nausea a doctor was called to my bedside suring the night I was sweating so bad and blood pressure had risen again I could not eat or drink without aid of a drip,the doctor decided to try the steroids again through an injection.No sooner had he done so when the abdominal pain left.I was never so relieved in all my life,it felt like he was god!!!!! i could sleep first time in i couldnt even remember!! The morphine had been very good for killing pain all along but knwoing it was gone without a painkiller was something else!   The next day I was left home and symptoms had all gone.....for a week.. I woke up not being able to lift my head with the pain in my head and my neck,It was such a fright I began to panic so bad and it was clear i needed another doctor. The doctor arrived and on seeing how much distress i was in called the hospital who informed her to call another ambulance and have me straight out. My consultant was waiting for me as I arrived at the hospital as the symptoms pointed towards menengitis they were worried and I was brought down for a CT scan and also a lumber puncture(one id like to forget) and i was giving a room in isolation.It took several hours for the results to be confirmed that I did not have menengitis.However I was kept in isolation for the next few days and treated with painkillers and anti biotics..before being told I could go home. That has been 3 weeks ago, I still have scars from the rash of my HSP..i still get the regular headache..the odd pain..but do feel weak all the time..I havent been the same since i got this disease.

This rash has ravaged her legs, her elbows, her hands.  Just when you think it is clearing, another round begins.  I haven't seen her normal skin in months.  It starts off like little bumps.  It gets very itchy and swells up like hives.  By the next day, it is flat and look like purplish red bruises under the skin.   I swear there is something more going on.

I was diagnosed in 1989.  After being diagnosed, shortly after surgery, I had all the typical symptoms.  I had hematuria for four years, and have continuing   to this day.  I control the loose stools with medication and diet.  The initial breakout of purpura took about a year to resolve, but I have had only one other time, about eight years ago, with the purpura appearing on my legs.  I found that all   cause problems for me, especially those contained in pain medications.  I do not take any OTC medications and am very careful about any medication prescribed to me.  I have always worked outside the home and have four grown children. I now find that I cannot take a job that requires me to stand or walk for extended periods of time because the hematuria returns.  I also have problems controlling my blood pressure since about three years after the initial attack.  I have never known any other adult with this condition and would like very much to communicate with another adult with the chronic form of this illness.

Im a 23 year old student at Universtiy in the UK.  I got HSP while i was on holiday in the states.  It started off with the red spots on my ankle and then spread untill i had a really bad rash all over my legs and on my waist aswell as around my elbows.  My fingers, ankles, toes, elbows and knees would all swell up and i had to take IBUPROFEN every 6 hours just to keep the pain at bay. I wont bore you all with the details of what the docs said and how i came to know i had HSP but basically after trial and error i was able to pin point some triggers that would set me off: Chocolate, Smoking, Drinking, Food with additives and preservatives in, Tight clothing and getting hot from walking to Uni or playing sport. After even more trial and error and a few months i was able to drink Vodka and cranberry as theres no additives or preservatives in either and i can now smoke 'American Spirit' Tobbaco (which you can only buy from tobacconists)  As a 23 year old student who enjoys partying and socialising it was a pretty big shock to the system as i could no longer go out and do what students do.   Just wanted to post this to let anyone who is in the same position as i was ( a student at uni who drank and smoke and then all of sudden could not go out had to eat a strict diet couldnt get worked up or hot) just rememeber that i had the same thing happen to me and now 5 months down the line im back to normal and everything is OK!  Yeah it is very annoying and painful and can really get you down but just remember it does not last forever and will get better! Thanks 1 like, 31 replies "

HELP,"Hi there,  I'm hoping I can get some advice from anyone who has had any type of hernia as I'm beginning to freak out a little! I'll start from the beginning, around 2 years ago when I was 18 I woke up one morning extremely bloated and could feel a sort of mass just below my ribs on my right side. This feeling of the mass went on for a few weeks or so, I went to see the Dr who sent me for an ultrasound on the whole of my abdomen. They couldn't find anything wrong but I was still having problems and worries about this lump which was hard, fairly large and I could move it around as if I could pop it back into myself? Also if I lay in a particular position and breath in and out I could feel it moving around? It doesn't protrude out of my skin however so isn't visible. I was sent back to have another ultrasound a few months later who again couldn't find anything. After this I just forgot about it and went about as normal, I didn't have many other problems. The lump was painless so was pretty easy to ignore. Fast forward to now, I'm nearly 21 and have still been having problems with this lump! I went to another Dr at my university a few months ago who claimed he couldn't feel anything and that was that. However the past few days I've had a lot of pain around the area and the mass is very prominent to feel, it seems like it's gotten larger? The pain is like a stabbing, burning sensation. I've been stupid and done some googling which has just freaked me out and I'm desperate for some advice. The reason I'm thinking it could be a hernia is because it seems to flair up and doesn't cause me constant problems, it disappears when I lie down and also if it was anything a lot worse I feel it would've been causing me many more problems over the 2 years, which it hasn't until now! I can't see a Doctor until I'm back at uni in January so have an agonising wait until then! If you've got this far then thank-you for reading, any advice or comfort would be greatly appreciated.

I recuperated in about 8 weeks, and went back to work, I worked one day, on a Friday and woke up the next day so nauseated and sick I was in bed all day. Burping unbelievably, heartburn, and hurting high in my abdomen. I have taken omeprazole for years for heartburn and acid stomach, but it was not even touching this. And I have never had nausea like this or the burping. I went to see my primary care doc. He changed the PPI to another one twice a day, told me to add Pepcid, and then gave me another med called sucrafate. By the time I saw him I was taking peptol bismol tagament, my own over the counter of what he prescibed. I have had multiple   done, an ultra sound, a fecal exam looking for H Pylori, have seen a GI specialist, and now had a endoscopy. The result is that I do not have an ulcer, do have GERD, but not really as bad as it could be, and he saw a small HH. But, he didn't think that the HH could cause this much discomfort, he said it was too small. He stretched my esophagus but noted that there had been no narrowing of the esophagus? They were suppose to do a   of my stomach lining, looking for H Pylori, but he didn't do it, I guess because he didn't find an ulcer. Mind you by the time that I had the endoscopy I had been on medications for 3 weeks! I have been off work for the last 3 weeks, and mostly sick and in bed. The nausea just puts me down, I can't function with it. My follow up appointment is not for another 3 weeks. Am I correct in assuming that with a sliding HH, it could be very small one day and very large the next? It is all about how much of the stomach is above the diaphragm , right? I am at my wits end. I need some relief. I mentioned my lung surgery because I have read that it can cause an HH. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Hernia,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hiatal-hernia-and-panic-attacks-need-some-insight--636044,Hiatal Hernia and Panic Attacks(Need some insight),"Hello all! Before I begin: -No history of cardiac issues(done around 4-5 tests, all clear) -GERD for several years(Diagnosed 3 years ago) -No particular family history aside from late 60s diabetes and high blood pressure late life. -20 years old male, no drugs, no smoking, no alcohol, healthy diet -Only real issue? Stress and sensitivity.     I've been suffering immensely due to an unknown illness. It'd cause long term tachycardia, general panic, insomnia, clammy cold hands, the whole slew of things. Generally what your body says when it wants you to know something is very wrong. I'd be fine one moment, and then suddenly have a weird feeling in my chest(turns out that was my hernia being pushed up from a stomach spasm) and then have a panic attack slowly come up. Of course, it's my body reacting to this, so it wasn't diagnosed as an SVT. I've had ALL the cardiac tests. Holter, Stress, Echo... You name it. I legitimately thought too many times that I was going to die suddenly and no one would know what was wrong with me. My heart would race and sometimes feel like it was going to just stop. I never passed out, it never happened without a precursor of panic(so if the tachycardia comes up SUDDENLY, like 90 to 160 in a couple beats, it's likely a cardiac issue). I starved myself in fear of having even more issues, but it turned out that it made it far worse. After year of being sick like this, the symptoms seemed to subside and disappear. I was fine for a while. I could run, do whatever with no issues. Then one day, it showed up again. Mysterious. I'd have runs of the same panic, the same chest pain, the same acid reflux... I took all the damn tests, but it was a hernia. The doctors demanded I take a CT to make sure, but I prefer not to have a huge dose of radiation at only twenty. I went to a chiropractor and had my stomach pulled and it got rid of all my symptoms immediately. All those 150-160 BPM panic attacks, all those sleepless nights, all those times when I swear I was thinking I was going to die...  I'm far more sensitive than normal people. I notice things wrong with my body much more clearly and feel much worse. No one understood what was wrong with me(I had telltale signs of a hernia even then, back pain, chest pain, belching, acid reflux). A hernia that was missed by endo-scopy obviously isn't that big of a deal, right? Wrong. My hernia isn't permanent. It straightens itself out and cramps up repeatedly. It can come and go, but it comes with a vengeance when I have long term stress or if I stress my GI. The point of this isn't to say that doctors are wrong, or that you shouldn't trust them. It's just that if you want to be healthy, you have to do your own research and find your problem if the fixes aren't working(this sadly happens more often than not). PPIs made me feel worse. My stomach spasms cause hernia and this hernia makes me feel god awful like I'm going to die(panic attacks randomly).  I'm having bouts of my hernia again, but when I use my chiropractor's method of pulling my stomach back down, VIOLA! No panic, tachy's gone, feelings of dying are gone.  Stress is a killer for any disease for the stomach. A lot of people say that ""stress doesn't cause problems with health"", but stress affects the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system. It slowly breaks that balance and makes everything spiral out of control. The body's a well oiled machine and one part that breaks makes the whole thing stop working.  The final thing I want to point out is that although there are set definitions out there of symptoms and various things for various illnesses,  Everyone's body is different(if this is hard to understand, think of it like this; everyone's minds are different, right? So obviously, the way they handle things is definitely going to be different!). They may be the same anatomically, but the way they react to certain drugs and the like is VERY DIFFERENT. The was the main issue I have with the current healthcare system. Far too many times do people have horrible reactions to different medications because of misdiagnosis and drug rejection from their bodies. Some people experience heart attacks like they're chest discomfort and some people experience them like it's the end of the world. Some people don't even noticed GERD and some people have straight up freak-outs that are chalked up to anxiety.  That aside, how is everyone doing with their hernias? Hernias generally are considered ""untreatable"" aside from surgery, but even to that, I find that a good lifestyle with activity can hold back even diabetes. I still get bouts of breathlessness(one in the middle of the night when my stomach is completely empty, but a glass of water tends to fix it quite nicely), but it's significantly better now that I know what's wrong with me and can get a hold of my own health. I'm just curious, how many of you hernia sufferers have felt this before? I feel like I'm the only one who has such violent symptoms from what I've seen.  Thanks and good luck with your road back to health! -Dan 1 like, 8 replies "

So I decided to go to the doctor, he didn't know quite what it was  but he said it could possibly be a hernia or a swollen lymph node, he said it felt more hernia like though. So he sent me to get an ultra sound done, but ordered an abdominal ultra sound instead of a groin ultra sound apparently, so the girl that did it decided to check my groin area as well as the abdominal area, but she spent more time on the abdominal area even though that wasn't where the bulge was. So I was waiting for about an hour for the results ad eventually the doctor called and said everything was fine and there was no hernia. The bulge also for some reason went away for about 4 days or so, I figured I was all good and wouldn't have to worry about it anymore so I just went on with life. Then it came back a few days later. So now I'm here trying to figure out why I have a bulge in my groin, It's just really stressing me out because I have to go to boot camp in July. The bulge also disappears when I lay down.

The bump on the side is quite big now and I know some of that will be due to swelling but to say I am disheartened is an understatement. I now also realise that my surgeon didn't tell me exactly what procedure he would do just that the bone would be cut and pinned. I didn't see him until an hour or so before surgery and was just so nervous about going under GA I didn't ask.

My 3 yrs old daughter contracted the virus during our recent trip to a kid's playground in a hotel (which i believe was the place that started it all to the irresponsible parents taking sick kid to a playground). On the first day she had high fever at 38 C, We took her to a doctor and the doctor prescribed a paracetamol for her and asked us to wait 3 days. On the 3rd day, she didnt want to eat as much as usual and had some visible red spots on her hands,thighs,private part, buttocks. We immediately took her to another doctor a specialist and checked her mouth and saw alot of ulcers inside, we were told she got HMFD a highly contagious viral disease. She said antibody will heal the virus but she prescribed a formula for her mouth so that she can drink as much liquid and eat again. The formula acts as an numbing agent; thankfully she is back to her normal activity after choking the formula for 3 days. At this moment, her red spots are gone and shes back to full health physically but we were told that the virus is still contagious and it can live up to 4 weeks. Both my wife and I spent alot of time nursing for our daughter because we were told the virus only attacks children under the age of 10. We had no fear of being caught sick at all, thats when we were wrong; After my daughter's 5th days of being sick i had a super headache that i thought someone split my head open; couldnt even sleep and my temp was at 38.3 C immediately went to an ER, they gave me strong antibiotics (which was useless) and they told me i had tonsil infection and paracetamol to help with the fever. Swallowing was like being sliced with knives in the throat, On my 3rd day I recovered from the fever, but red spots beginning to appear on my hands and fingers nothing on my feet. I went to another doctor and she prescribed Isoprinosine and Acyclovir topical cream both are anti-viral medicines. After taking them day to day and now the 5th day. I notice the red spots are getting worse it multiplies more on fingers and now my feet also blistered. Walking with winching as i go through each day.

But boy this was NOT a mild virus like the websites and my doctor said it would be. It started out normal, but wow did it itch and burn!  Here’s what I experienced and what OTC remedies I used. I contracted it from my 1 year old niece and she had a much milder case than I did!  Day 1: mild sore throat and 101 fever  Day 2: searing terrible sore throat, 101 fever and red spots on back of throat.  Day 3: little red pimples, super itchy, started appearing on my fingers.  Day 4: full blown red spots and blisters on hands and feet. One blister on my tongue, and no more red spots on my throat. My hands were so itchy I thought I was going to pass out. I also developed a ring of scabs / bumps around my ears, beneath my hair, and sort of around the hairline in the back of my head. Not itchy at all but really dry and scabby.  Day 5: same as day 4, although my feet started to swell where the red spots and blisters were. Miserable!  Day 6:   has fully disappeared but red spots and blisters are still here. They are dry now. No pain or burning any longer, but some tenderness.  What remedies I used:  Nyquil (day one and two only, as I thought I had a cold)  Antihistamine - helped a lot! (After day one and two when I knew it was HFMD, and only sparingly, as I had a prescription anti-inflammatory I used instead for the remaining days).  Lavender oil - small soothingness  Aloe Vera gel - my saviour  Oats and water - made into a paste and applied to hands and feet - also my saviour!  Head and shoulders shampoo for my scalp scabs.  It was hour by hour what would help. In the end only the oats and water and the anti-inflammatory would ease the itching long enough for me to nap.  Folks this is a TERRIBLE virus!  I hope it all goes away soon. At least I’m not itching anymore! I don’t wish this on anyone. Geez what an ordeal.  0 likes, 0 replies "

She went through all the classic phases and is now pretty much over it.  She never really had much trouble other than malaise and mild  . No itchiness or pain. She still has some of the red spots but most of her skin is peeling and replacing these. She's pretty resilient and as far as I know this was the first time she'd ever been sick in 3.8 years. I started noticing muscle aches about 5 days ago and that quickly turned into full body aches and fever.  I couldn't sleep that night and was beginning to think I had the flu so I visited a walk in clinic and was tested for Flu, Strep,   and this of course was negative. They simply left it most likely a virus. Of course that evening I started developing the blisters on my hands and they quickly became itchy. Over the next 3 days my hands and feet were covered with these pustules. They were itchy to the point of madness. I couldn't sleep, relax, watch tv or even think for this. I truly went to the edge... Now for pretty much most of my life I've suffered from Dishidrotic Excema. For those familiar it can be equally maddening. My hands would develop similar looking pustules just beneath the skin with itchiness always present. Occasionally this would happen on my feet. I learned years ago about bleach baths and that had always been my go to defense for this. After a few soaks of just my hands or feet in tubs of strong bleach water the excema would always halt and then retreat. This HFMD presented in much the same way and I figured I'd fight it just like the excema. It took a bit longer to halt than the excema but I feel like the bleach bath was effective. The itchiness is all but gone. The spots are still here and will be until the skin replaces itself but my sanity reserves are replenishing. I can actually sleep and do most everything normally. During this I also used Calamine which provided absolutely no relief. I used Nyquil with 10% alcohol, may or may not have helped.. not sure. I used benedryl capsules, I think helped with itchiness. I used ibuprofen for pain. Nothing I believe helped more than the bleach baths. The way I mixed it was probably something like 8 parts water, 2 parts bleach. I always mixed it to where the solution felt very slippery when I rubbed my fingers together in the solution. Now this is strong. It left my skin smelling like bleach even after washing and did produce minor chemical burning on the more sensitive skin areas of my hands and feet but for me was definitely well worth it. I just wanted to post what had worked for me as I know what a nightmare this is. Good luck to all. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Hand Foot And Mouth Disease,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/help-hfmd-for-three-months-and-counting--488062,Help! HFMD for three months and counting!,"Hi everyone, I am literally at wits end! I am begging for anyones help I would appreciate it so much!! In september (2015) I contracted HFMD, starting with large (r than normal) red blisters with white in the middle, on my hands and feet, with dehydration, mild temperature, tiredness, a lot of itching, and a bit of a sore throat, but hardly an issue around my mouth just one tiny bump and one tiny ""leaking"" lip area. Three doctors saw me and all said, yep its hfmd it'll go on its on time don't worry! 10 days maximum. Well!  Here I am almost three months later with reocurring rash (and lip leaking) which over time the size of the individual bumps have lessened, however, I can rest and be good to my body for a few days, and then if I have to wake up early for work or go out with friends, it'll start to creep back. (but noting that never has the rash completely dissapeared) as the rash goes back then i can start to get those flu symptoms but minimally. I swear its acting like herpes??? as if its chronic! :'( I have to start my education in a month and I feel incredibly alone, I saw an additional two doctors that have never seen a case like this lasting so long and nobody knows what to do.  Since i've got access to scholarly articles I read up as much as I could and from the limited info that was there, I decided to talk to my doctor to give me Acyclovine , which is usually used for herpes simplex, shingles etc, and although it is known to not have the same effect for coxsackie, a study and a case study indicate that it may help. But really, this has turned into an absolute nightmare and if ANYONE else has experienced anything similar I would absolutely love to hear what happened to you and what you did, or if you have any advice.

Haematological Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/your-autoimmune-neutropenia-story-674180,Your Autoimmune Neutropenia story,"I feel like most of the threads are “help me” threads, begging for advice or support. Perhaps it would be helpful for anyone who has been diagnosed with Autoimmune Neutropenia to share their story; initial symptoms, discovery process, living with the condition. It might help those who think they may being going through it, too. I had frequent infections (URI, cold sores, stomach viruses) for a few years and swore to my husband that I had a poor immune system. Little did I know that it was literally true. In Oct. ‘17, I had labs done by a rheumatologist and my WBC/ANC came back 2.1/0.73. I received no call from that doctor regarding the abnormality but I noticed it via the online portal. Being a nurse, I knew to be concerned. I went to the ER for vertigo 2 days later and mentioned my abnormal labs to that Dr. but he lied to me at discharge and told me my labs came back normal. So when I saw the results I did some digging into my historical labs and saw that I had low WBC/ANC the previous year during pre-op labs. I had my PCP (GP) send me to a hematologist. He did some more labs and said, “It could be leukemia but I don’t think so. We should ‘watch and wait.’” I insisted on a bone marrow biopsy and he told me the results were normal and that he didn’t want to treat me when my numbers were low unless I got sick enough to be hospitalized. I was not satisfied with his lack of desire to find out WHY I was neutropenic so I went to Mayo. He retested the same BMB sample and said my results were not normal. I have reticulin fibrosis (scarring) in my marrow, which indicates that I’m developing another condition but since it’s in development, we don’t know what it is yet. He suspects lupus but I won’t know for 5-10 years. Meanwhile, I’ve been working as a nurse in a hospital and haven’t gotten sick from a patient. My lowest numbers were last week at 1.9/0.2. Still no treatment because I’m not “sick.” In fact, I’ve not been getting sick lately at all, which is odd because my numbers are in the basement. I will be addressing this with my doctor next week. I think it might be because I’m aware of my condition and take precautions to avoid getting sick, especially at work. My concern now is that my numbers keep declining and I don’t have much room to go before I literally have no neutrophils. They keep telling me they don’t want to treat me (with something like Neupogen) unless I get hospitalized but I fear by then I’ll be extremely sick. I did take 3 doses of Neupogen before a trip out of the country to avoid being hospitalized while on holiday. It is extremely painful, even though I took Claritin and paracetamol. I woke up in terrible pain and rocked back and forth in bed for hours. It’s not something I want to take on a regular basis but I need to stay safe. I also got a boil on my breast out of the blue. My skin would not have healed if not for the Neupogen at the time. I should also mention that the first abnormal WBC I had was in 2014 but that my ANC was normal at that time. But it gives me a timeline of when things approximately started and how fast my numbers are changing. I’m to have another BMB in November to check on progression and changes. My sister just got a similar WBC result to that of my first abnormal result so she will be getting monitored for changes like mine. 1 like, 2 replies "

A month and a half later and three antibiotics the lymph node is still there and other symptoms had begun (constant fever, extreme fatigue, night sweats, constant need to clear my throat) .  I had a check up with my ENT in November (normal routine check up) and an ultrasound was done and said lymph nodes were reactive just to check back in three months. Went to my GP and blood test were ordered showing my white blood cell was high along with neutrophils.  My GP refers me to  infectious disease dr.  This dr ran multiple blood test for infections which all came back negative. A ct scan that I still don't know the results as I haven't had my follow up. In the meantime the dr requested I get back to the ENT sooner than later to get the lymph node biopsied. I went back to the ENT in January who did another ultrasound and did not seem to concerned but said he would call the infectious disease dr to see what she wanted to do and would call me. The ent's office called to schedule a biospy which was last week. The results came back and the ENT's office says they are normal but the report shows due to low cellularity a limited flow cytometry was performed. The report ends with hodgkin lymphoma, some large cell lymphomas and non-hematopoietic tumors cannot be excluded by flow cytometry. Correlation with morphology, clinical history and other diagnostic information is recommended. Should I just leave it at that and move on or should I seek out additional medical advice?

I can't ask anyone in my family because MM (or a form that is more rare and very similar apparently -  that some researchers at Indiana University wanted to study before VA discarded everything IU requested as my father was literally dying, which I cannot even get into because it makes me so sick) —but some were dx'd with MM & some had mysterious cancers they never could figure out, so they dx'd by where they believed it to have metastasized. These are the cancer deaths, everyone was taken in  similar fashion as far as time of discovery -> death: <P> My father (in 60s), first cousin (30s), aunt (3, but they thought back then it was related more to lymphocytes than plasma cells), great uncle (40s), and grandmother (40s). <P> A tiny bit of odd history for me: never had any allergies in life but Benedryl & Penicillans, but 4 years ago I got very sick and my immune system went haywire. I saw my first ENT, developed mutiple blood-tested food allergies bizarrely to things like wheat, gluten, egg, cow dairy, soy, etc., ended up needing sinus surgery, needed immunotherepy (but quit going soon after starting) my fever developed (which hasn't left yet, and no one can figure out), and life was hell. I eventually ended up feeling bit better, but a couple years later, I felt the same kind of sick in different circumstances. 3 years after my initial development of first string of allergies, last year, my immunologist ended up re-testing me (both skin prick and needle injection ways) - and  !!? <P> Instead, I had developed massive environmental allergies, so badly I started immunotherapy for that... No one understood why: not my allergist, immunologist, and my ENT was convinced my mast cells and histamine were at play (as I have a Narcolepsy dx and research has recently been considering histamine a potential variable in N), anyway, I was just happy I could eat everything again. <P> Feeling sicker and sicker, my doctors and variety of specialists (because I have a lot of weird dx's) did so many tests. But, it never dawned on me to look into what MM even was until some concerning incidents that started last November— in fact, I had told my doctors about C in my dads family, but ignorantly enough, never said anything beyond ""C"", I always thought it dealt with red blood cells, and my dads sister who died at 3 was the oddball because she had white. In Nov I was inspired to research what the cancer was and symptoms of it to make sure my docs were testing for it (it wasnt, they didnt do anything beyond major biomarkers for common cancers), but I ended up with too much on my health plate to look into it further at the time. (It's obviously on my list) — anyway when I realized what MM was, naturally I was like   <P> , literally on the other side of these sacral region masses!? I'm more of a petite figure (5'3"", 110ish lbs), so her assumptions were all the pain, the recent nerve things, the slow vascular flow and the coming and going of what felt like swollen lymph nodes or blood clots - she attributed it all to this cyst. She didn't discredit by any means pain associated with the 12 year long palpable neoplasm (which was growing, only inwards, calcifying things along its way) - but she did make clear the ovarian cyst was of absolute abnormal size, and that it needed to be removed soon since it was contorting, and because of the very real possibility of it cutting off blood supply to my right leg in the near future. She also attributed my recent month long bout of nausea & vomiting (which I thought was from high levels of pain) to the extreme amounts of hormones that large cysts can release. <P> So she scheduled me a laparoscopy for the upcoming 22nd and explained how when she is removing the cyst, may end up taking the ovary, and possibly even both. I joked she could have them, I'm 35 & done baby-making, but the seriousness in her typically bubbly and playful personality caught me a big off guard. <P> Since I've never had an ovarian cyst, I was having a hard time swallowing how something that just popped up out of no where could be causing all the recent 13-week complications that a 12 year long painful spinal chord injury directly adjacent to it has, which is when she explained how when ovaries flip upside down will cause severe lower back & muscle strain pain, affecting blood vessels and the same nerves that would cause the original temporary loss of sensation in my leg. <P> ... however I just had already been mentally preparing myself for a rather intense surgery removing the abnormal growth of calcification around my freaking spinal chord - and suddenly a simple outpatient procedure  ? for   kind of pain?! <P> She said I would get a call from her nurse soon explaining what to expect on all potential outcomes, on the parts that might have to go, and recovery times for all so I felt armed and ready.   <P> I spent the rest of Tuesday not thinking about it & going on a first date with a guy I had been excited about (who I went on another successful one with yesterday in case you were curious!) <P> ...but when I woke up yesterday, and the reality hit more, I read a bit online, (not much - because as mentioned, I have the craziest most extensive list of seemingly unrelated dx's, a 4.5 year long fever no one can figure out, 14 specialists and now 5 surgeons- I   to not play Google Doc, because that's pointblank pointless.) I'd rather just wait with as much grace and patience as I can summon, & deal with what I need to when I get there, no sense in wasting energy   <P> ...so yeah, then yesterday I was reading some info online- just about cysts in general, how they form, the procedure, etc., and took note my cyst seemed to have grown rather fast, and that 4+ish"" diameter was not only rather large, but ""gigantic"" - according to the pathological terminology I crossed, but I shook off any worry. <P> I am a traveling photographer and do lots of contract work for a company that sends me all over the US. I reached out to the girl who schedules my trips and gave her the timespan on days I was unable to shoot. Empathetic as she is, she asked me questions out of curiosity and because she wanted to make sure my health was okay. I told her about my little cyst situation, brushing it off as the no biggie it had felt like  . <P> Apparently her last job for 5 years was working with an Ovarian Cancer Non-Profit foundation, so she probed just a respectable amount, and I probably answered a bit more in depth than both she or I were expecting — but I've been a bit worried since my talk with her.

I was told this typically comes from an autoimmune disease but was tested and nothing came back. I have been getting blood work since late December to have a better idea for my doctor to see where my blood ranges are, I have close to high wbc, close to high platelets, high hct, high hgb, high rbc, close to high lyphocytes and close to high neutrophils. The ones that say (close to high) are because they are still in normal range but are different from the past, these last 4 test they have all come back on the higher side, I have no cold, flu, or infection that doctors can find, I have had a CT with contrast, MRI with contrast both came back with nothing.  For the past 5 months straight I have had the following symptoms: I am waiting on the JAK2 mutation testing to come back, anyone have an idea how long that usually takes? Also is this mutation common to find? I finally was researching on my own which usually leads to nothing good, but asked my doctor if it could be polycythemia vera or some sort of blood disorder? She said she was actually wanting to look into that more because this was something she had come up with as well. I guess I am wondering about the mutation gene, Also if anyone else has gone through similar symptoms? Did you have pv or leukemia?  Is the best way to find out for sure about pv, leukemia and other blood disorders done with a bone marrow test/biopsy?  whats the likelihood of me having one of these types of cancers, even if my blood test are not exactly over the ""normal""? What steps should I be pushing for with my doctors to get this sorted out? My doctor did tell me if these last blood test were still coming back the same then she would be sending me to the hematologist, but she also said something along the lines of they will look through my chart and see if they need to see you....

It turned out to be a   coupled with my pre-existing AF not being adequately controlled (resting heart rate too high). The hospital did a whole range of test on me and after suitable medication I was very soon back to normal. However, as a result of the tests they think I have a fractured vertebra (T5) near a pre-existing hemangioma which I've had for years. Now I’ve not been in a situation to cause a fractured vertebra, I’ve only just recently had a major heart op so I’ve been taking it very easy. So they’ve sent off some blood samples for myeloma screening. I’m not sure why they thought that was a good idea, the back pain and the ""fracture"" I guess. I’ve still got a bit of back pain but it depends on the time of day (worse as the day goes by) and what I’m doing physically (lots of bending is not good). It’s not major but it’s enough to warrant co-codomol. I’ve not had the results of the myeloma screening yet so I don’t know if I have myeloma or not. Obviously I’ve started to do a bit of research and I find it’s a terminal disease in most cases. This is freaking me out somewhat!

Anyhow, regardless of HH, my treatment for the pct is exactly the same as yours, venesection.

I've seen different doctors for the past couple of months and have yet to figure out what is wrong. I started crossfit in May and have lost twenty pounds until my doctor advised me to stop exercising completely in late October due to much fatigue I have been experiencing, and continue to experience today, until we find out what is going on. I am a 22 year old male, weighing approximately 158 and am 6 feet tall. In mid-July I was started to feel a lot of discomfort in my stomach and abdominal area along with nausea, bloating, and constipation. It got worse after eating. All the symptoms left in early August but then came back in early September. So, I went to my family care doctor and he ex-rayed my stomach to show that there was air in my colon. He then referred me to a gastroenterologist. The gastroenterologist checked for blood in my feces and there was none and he did a CBC and CMP blood test. The only thing that came back wrong was a low white blood cell count. So for the next month, my family care doctor ordered three more CBC tests, along with a SED Rate test, Peripheral Smear (immaturity not observed), CRP C-REACTIVE PROTEIN, Parvovirus, IRON AND TBC, HIV, HEPATITIS PANEL ACUTE, EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS, and COMP METABOLIC PANEL blood tests. Everything was normal and good except that my white blood cell count values were low from 2.8-3.8 during that time, a high monocyte percentage of 11.8, and it was noted I have bilirubinemia. Through much of October and early November my symptoms went away again except for the fatigue but now I am experiencing much of the same symptoms again. As of last week I was referred to a hematologist and he took my blood in four or five tubes. I go back in mid-December to see what he says. The hematologist also asked me to go to a gi doctor while I wait so I did today. My gastrointestinal doctor said it was mostly out of his hands because all my blood tests only show a low white blood cell count. So, he put me on two medicines to help me use the restroom (#2) more frequently. Could anyone lead me to possible causes of the low white blood cell count with the stomach/abdominal pain and the fatigue? I am quite nervous about what it could be because at this point I have no clue. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!  1 like, 34 replies "

Consequently I have been monitoring myself wth   arranged privately.  My ferritin levels have fluctuated over the past 2 years  with 276.2 being the highest and 119 being the lowest. In April 2018 my ferritin was 119 ug/L (yay!).          It' s now 182. My serum iron at its lowest was 20.3 umol/L.          It's now 31.26. My transferrin saturation at it's lowest was 29.46%.     It's now 55.37%. My TIBC at it's highest was 68.9 umol/L .           It's now 56.46. My liver function tests are all with normal ranges and my latest CRP is towards the low end of normal.  Presumably this means there is a low level of inflammation in the body? I have been a pescatarian for 30 years.  I do not eat meat.  Nor do I drink alcohol.  And I certainly do not supplement with anything containing iron! I don't think I am consuming haem iron so I am at a loss to explain the recent spike in my levels. I tried to donate blood at the Blood donation clinic a couple of years ago, but they refused to take it.  (Because I once had a suspected   attack....even though it turned out not to be and I received the all clear from the cardiologist.   The blood donation people wouldn't take the risk of me being adversely affected by the sudden drop.) So, my question is....should I be concerned about the recent  increase in my saturation % and serum iron? Thankyou. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I still have a few more venesections to go before reaching the target I would just like to check with those who have been through this if your conditions improve when your ferritin level dropped to 50? The only symptom I have at the moment is the aches and pains in my upper right abdomen and that radiate to the back underneath the right  shoulder blade, and I feel tired easily nowadays. This is affecting my daily life and I just wonder if there's anything else I can do to relieve the symptom? Any help or advice you can offer will be highly appreciated.

My billirubin was high at 1.5, serum iron was high at 178, transferring saturation was high at 60%, but ferritin was a normal number at 88. Next, I ran a dna test  and am only heterozygous for H63D.  I took these results to a gastroenterologist and was told the billirubin was probably Gilbert's syndrome (harmless), and that some people just have high iron and it is harmless since the DNA test showed no hemochromatosis.  He wanted to get to the bottom of my fatigue and pain, so I've had an endoscopy, an abdominal CT, been tested for h pylori and celiac.  Everything has turned out fine.  The most recent test was a 24 hr urine for porphyria.  I got the results back a couple of days ago, and it did not signal porphyria (although I don't know how accurate it is when the urine is collected when I was not having an attack).  Anyway, I am now reading about non-HFE iron overload.  I'm not sure what to look at for some clue about non-HFE or if that is even something to pursue with a normal ferritin.   1 like, 23 replies "

I am currently day 9 post op and still in a living nightmare.... This apparently ""less painful"" procedure to fix my grade 3's has given me a lot more than i bargained for... i have seriously never experienced such pain in my life (the fact they gave me morphine to go home with and signed me off for 4 weeks should have rung alarm bells, i know)!! the pain was seriously so bad i had practically taken up residence in the bath tub for just a bit of relief.  It was from this bath tub 5 days in that i ended up calling myself an ambulance because this just wasn't right, surely i should be suffering from a pain the butt right, not feeling as if my entire downstairs was about to explode. Added to that my belly looked bigger than it had when i was 7 months pregnant.  I just didn't know where to put myself. So off to a&e i go and discover something they never warned me about pre op,  . Now i knew i was having trouble peeing but thought i was getting most of it out via the bath or my new pee standing up method but clearly not. A catheter was swiftly inserted and they drained 1.5 litres of fluid.  This was quite impressive apparently, the most the nurse in a&e had ever seen! There was instant relief. I should mention that i still hadn't had my first post op poo at this point despite taking the  .  That soon changed when i got up to the assessment unit and oh my god. armageddon !! The poor nurse, the poor other patients (there was no toilet i could get to in time but luckily a commode)... it wasn't so much the pain i remember but i know i nearly passed out, cold sweats, panic attack the lot.  Anyway even though i had this massive release the docs thought that the reason i couldn't pee was because i was backed up so the next day i received not one but two enemas. Now an enema in itself is not so bad, but up a bottom that had just had hemmorhoid surgery? well i was staring to think these people were sadists! But this was still to no avail and i simply could not pee. The catheter went back in and they threatened to send me home with it for 2 weeks hoping that when my bottom was better my bladder would start behaving itself. I was not looking forward to this prospect at all. Anyway long story short the next day the pain in the but was a little less and i managed to pee and got released catheter free, hurrah. Now for the next problem, since coming home i cannot stop going to the toilet. i have constant diarrhea. Is this a hang over from the enemas? i don't know but i wish it would stop!! i'm not taking laxatives at the moment because literally everything i eat is going straight through me 😦  this is obviously not helping with the sore bum situation.  Has anyone else experienced this? It just seems to be one thing after another. i'm sure with any other op i've had after 9 days i've been pretty much back to normal...

I was referred by my GP last June for an urgent 2 week   but actually ended up having a flexible  . All was clear (phew) and they banded 2 haemorrhoids (stage 2) which they attributed the bleeding to. The bleeding continued and i had another couple banded in January just gone. Long story short, I'm still suffering from what i consider heavy bleeding with clots. It happens consistently for 4 to 5 days then stops for a week or two. All this time I've had a dull pulling pain in my lower right abdomen which the consultant dismisses. This pain worsens right before i start bleeding again. I could attach pics but wouldn't want to gross everyone out, but essentially the toilet looks like a blood bath and blood sprays into the toilet followed by fast dripping. When i wipe there are always clots. After flushing there are usually clots still in the bottom of the toilet. During the 4-5 days this can happen 3-4 times per day. I'm just after some reassurance that others with haemorrhoids have similar experiences as i can't help worrying that something more sinister is going on. 0 likes, 10 replies "

Day 3 :Blisters appeared on hands and feet. Two nights of no sleep due to extreme discomfort (feeling like hands were lit on fire) the whole time.  My only relief was sandwiching hands between a large ice pack and occasionally soaking hands and feet in Epsom salt water.The doctor basically said there was nothing to do, but wait. Fabulous. She prescribed lidocaine for my hands, which I never got the RX filled.    It gets better. I started to get these nasty tiny sores and discoloration by my nose that wouldn't go away from days 4-8. They just looked nasty. I was using diluted hydrogen peroxide mouth rinse twice a day to avoid canker sores.  I had two canker sores on side of tongue that I would hit with direct hydrogen peroxide on a Q tip twice a day. This seemed to help. Gargling salt water kept sore throat at bay. I just kept taking Tylenol, but it didn't help a whole lot. I also started using organic virgin coconut oil on hands and feet at night.minread it has anti viral properties, but don't take my word for this.  It seemed to soothe the blisters a little. The thing that helped most on day 4 was doing a 30 minute healing meditation twice a day. Calmed my nerves and then the healing process started kicking in. I really do think my body was too stressed out to know how to repair. I had a burn on my wrist from days before the virus and during the first 4 days it was infected. Almost like my body was attacking everything. The meditation seemed to start healing the burn by day 5 as well.   I had to bandage my hands after day 10 when I returned to work. Lots of people,masked questions, I said I burned my hands.  I delt with  flaky and peeling hands for two weeks after and calloused feet. Skin on toes all started to peel off. Now a month later my entire skin of heel is dead and starting to peel off in large pieces. It's gross and pretty ridiculous.

WELLL... i was given a codeine and a sandwich and sent on my way, my lovely mother stopped off to get me all the fibre in the world on the way home, 10pm by this point! all i can say is i felt like someone had dragged my insides out. i am now on DAY 9 and have gone through 106 sanitary pads full of bloood (maybe so many because i have been changing VERY frequently), however day 9 and i am still in mild discomfort and my anus looks worse than it did before.  the pain/discomfort for the first 4-5 was 8/10. I just want to make it very very very clear that i was completely missled and completely underestimated to pain i would be in.  i had to make up a b*****t  excuse to miss work and uni and also not see my boyfriend. I can honestly say for me if i could go back i would 100% not have the procedure, i'm aware my story may seem bad but i know i'm not the only one who was told i'd be better within a couple days and over 1 week later still in a lot of pain and i there is no sign of my anus looking any better. i hope this helps someone out there, and also if anyone has had a similar experience please please let me know... would also like to add i have contacted the private hospital about the pain and they just persuaded me it was normal 😕 also still day 9 struggling to urinate/pass BM/sleep. 0 likes, 3 replies "

Haemorrhoids,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/successful-chinese-treatment-on-piles-in-less-than-a-week-683057,Successful Chinese treatment on piles in less than a week,"Hi all, I just like to share my experience and also as gratitude to the doc that have treated me and also help people who are suffering from piles that there is truly a rather fast and limited pain treatment out there! Long story short, i always have doubt on tradition chinese medicine (TCM) but since i moved to Singapore for work, i heard many good things about TCM and did some acupuncture treatment for my plantar faciitis and it totally fixed the problem i had for years. I have piles since high school, it doesn't really bother me, no pain, infrequent blood and i can always ""push"" it back. However, over the years, they seem to have grown and it was harder to push them back even though i still don't feel pain or blood. But i am very conscious about having a ""flower""   growing outside my rear though only my partner get to see them, i am still super conscious and i was concern that it will just keep growing and if i get older, it would be harder to go under knife or endure the living hell recovery stage for 2-3 weeks. I googled extensively for local and overseas treatment that i can ""avoid"" sufferings and i came across Tonyo Medical hall in singapore  and decided to go for a consultation with my limited mandarin, and brought a local friend with me to help with translation. He told me that i have about 8 internal and external piles altogether but it is not the worst he has seen or treated and assured me that during the whole procedure i would only feel ""ant bite"" pain that last less than few seconds, absoIutely no cutting and i wont be under any GA or LA since TCM doctors are not allow to administer that. i was skeptical of coz and told him i will need time to think about it, neither did he pressure me.. I talked to friends that had their piles fixed and they told me about their horrible living hell during their recovery via surgery or ligation. i read many postings here as well that helped me decide too. So in less than a week after the 1st consultation with Dr. Koh, i decided to go along with the procedure, which was 3 days ago (yay, i am now sitting upright and typing this experience while it is fresh on my mind). The first day he managed to treat 6 out of my 8 piles and the next day i went back to do another 2 big ones. Reason why he could not  do all in one is because of the position of the 2 huge piles are behind the 6 piles so he needs to get to the front piles first, shrink them in order to proceed to the 2 huge ones. i was super nervous but glad it was what he described, ant bite pain for few seconds on each pile. I came home with little pain and  abit of ""discomfort"" as the piles have started shrinking I guess. He advise me to work from home next few days, don't be too active with my walking so not to irritate the piles as it continue shrinking and will eventually fall off. He also gave me some cream to apply and also told me to do sitz bath with salt for few days. i personally took some synflex to manage that little pain on the first night. i went back to him today for examine, and he took out the some piles (i have pics) that have fallen off, just like that. i am still amaze how quick and relatively painless the whole procedure has been. Not sure if there is similar traditional chinese medicine in the states but do check out if possible. i totally lucked out with this work posting to singapore. 0 likes, 6 replies "

I have had hemorrhoids since last year, but they were mostly asymptomatic, except for a little blood a couple times when I was really constipated or thought I needed to have a bowel movement and didn't. Until the very end of last year though, I did not have the constant pain,  , and burning that I have had all of this year now. This pain actually started with unexpectedly needing to have another bowel movement one evening even when I had already had a big one that day, and not from constipation. I have a smaller external one in front of my anus and a bigger one behind that is mostly internal but comes out after a bowel movement. My hemorrhoids only bled twice in January, and within a couple weeks between instances, but multiple times in February and March so far. I did not have a bowel movement for three days until today, because I did not want to have to strain and I am afraid of any more anal bleeding. However, today, before having a bowel movement, I put some hemorrhoid cream on a wipe, which I have also been using instead of toilet paper now, was gentle, and still saw some spots, even though it had been a few days. Is there anything I can do to keep my hemorrhoids from bleeding, and eventually get them to go away? Thanks. 0 likes, 4 replies "

Also look at the texture towards the end it looks as though something is scraping up against the stool. Could hemorhoids be the cause of this?

I had a bunionectomy exactly a year ago. In the months following the surgery, I properly followed the recovery instructions. Almost immediately after switching from a surgical shoe to a regular shoe, I noticed that I had pain under my third and fourth toes with every step. I let my surgeon know about the pain about 3-4 months after surgery but he seemed unconcerned and brushed it off as something that would heal eventually. 11 months after the surgery I saw a different podiatrist and almost immediately after I mentioned my symptoms he felt my foot and diagnosed 2 neuromas. After looking at my x-rays he said the surgery was done well and this was a seperate issue. However, I never had this problem before and seeing as it occurred directly after having the surgery, it appears to be a direct cause. This problem affects me significantly everyday. I am experiencing pain with every step I take and I am extremely limited with what I can do physically. I never expected to be debilitated from bunion surgery. Before the surgery I was an active runner, running up to 8 miles a day. Nowadays I am having trouble just walking short distances because of the pain and discomfort. I have received 1 cortisone injection from the doctor that diagnosed the neuromas but unfortunately, it has only worsened the pain. There is a surgery that can be done to sever the nerves however, it is extremely risky and has a low success rate. I am interested to know if anybody here has also developed a neuroma post bunion surgery and whether or not I have any claim against the surgeon. Thank you in advance! 0 likes, 2 replies "

Turned out after surgery that he only shaved the bunion and took out a walnut sized cyst (what he thought was bursitis in the x-ray).  Once he did that, he said he thought it was unnecessary to cut the bone and put in a screw, as the tarsal looked fine then.  He thinks the cyst was pushing the bone outward.  I was very excited that there was not bone cutting and no screw.  I thought it would heal so much faster!  Wrong.  It has been so slow, but finally seemed to be getting better at times during the past week (3 weeks post).  But, three days ago I started physical therapy to get my 4 smaller toes to move more and for them to actually touch the ground and supposedly to get some ultrasound to help the swelling when it happens.  The physical therapist seemed great and helped my toes go down more and gave me exercises to get things to loosen up and move.  But in the couple days since then, the swelling comes back way more easily and the pain under on the bottom of my foot (feels like I am walking on a stone) is worse.  Is that due to physical therapy or what?  My physical therapist did not do ultrasound, so am thinking of asking her on Tuesday when I got back if we need to do that, like doctor said for the swelling.  I'm really not sure if that helps the swelling or pain or what?  She did help the movement in my toes already and I am doing the exercises 2x a day.  I am just VERY upset and concerned about the walking on a stone pain and the swelling and hot feeling that has been happening the past few days more often.  It is like I am regressing instead of  feeling improvement.  Please let me know your experiences if you have had similar issues. Thank you!! 0 likes, 6 replies "

The left foot bunion removed and big toe straightened (this foot wasn't causing problems but surgeon did it as a precaution) Right foot bunion removed and big toe straightened. 2nd toe straightened with K wire. 3rd toe, bone (knuckle) removed and toe straightened with K wire. Both feet were in casts for initial 2wks, I was told to put no weight on them and keep them elevated. I lived in my bedroom. Anytime I tried to stand (To go to toilet) the pain was so bad I felt every bone was breaking in my feet! After 2wks, casts came off and stitches removed I was pleased with the look of my toes, everyone straight! New casts went on....for another 4wks. When these were removed I was told I cld leave...no x-rays....no follow up appt?! I questioned this and mentioned that my toes seemed to be drifting back. I was told I was being impatient and I was only half way through recovery! I went home confused and frustrated. I couldn't understand why after breaking 4 toes, removing bones and placing pins an x-ray would not be taken? And why no follow up after such a big op? After 12 wks (so called recovery time)I called to make an appointment to see the surgeon as I was having alot of pain and struggling to walk. My toes were overlapping again and putting shoes on was difficult. 2nd toe lacked feeling and seemed to be floppy. When he saw me his reaction was to sigh and imply I was some kind of hypochondriac     again I was told I was impatient! and when I explained that my big toe won't go down and I can't move it he said I wasn't even trying! I was told I would be off work for 12wks, my job has me walking for 6.5hrs a day, I explained there is no way I cld go back to my work as I struggle to walk or even stand for any period of time, he said his 'normal' patients are bk to work by this time! I told him his attitude towards me was not acceptable and I wanted a 2nd opinion. His tone then changed, I was sent for an x-ray and I am now awaiting an appointment.  My right foot is worse than before, My toes are badly overlapping and bent. I am still not able to work and feel really depressed.

It started out mild but if I kept running it would turn into full blown, sharp arch pain. It would prevent me from walking for at least a few days after. But then about a week later, walking was perfectly fine again. I stayed away from running over the past year and only just started getting back into it. I took up swimming in January to March of 2018, and then have mostly been focused on biking since that time. Biking doesn't seem to exacerbate the pain at all. Just in January of this year, I began running again and it was going pretty well. But then two weeks ago, the pain returned after running then going to a rock climbing gym. I recently changed rock climbing shoes and that is part of the problem I believe. I just went and got X rays and talked with an orthopedic a week ago. Unfortunately, he told me he could see nothing from the x-rays. I'm at least glad the bones are ruled out, but it kind of leaves me with very little to go off of. The doctor didn't think it was plantar fasciitis from what I was describing. Plus, I've heard people talk about how PF will cause your feet to be sore in the morning, but as it warms up the pain goes away. For me it's the exact opposite. The longer I'm on my feet during the day, the worse it gets. And I've hear PF causes heel pain. My heels have been just fine. Really the only thing that feels good when the pain is present is to keep weight off. Here's are images of where it hurts: Any suggestions or advice on this issue would great.

I finally found the solution. remarkable results,  please read and and follow directions  I'm only giving this info to help others, I am not receiving money, commission or anything, I'm actually giving my time. Oils are no good for folliculitis,  no tea trea, coconut,  olive oil,  nothing, the infection needs to be dry weather it's your arms scalp, face, legs, balls, etc. Take sterilized tweezer, and pluck every hair in, on, or around the bumps or inflamed area, get your companion or friend to help if you cant reach or see the area, shaved area makes easier to see, not balled, but 1 with or against the grain will be fine. Squeeze any pus bumps or white heads, after plucking and popping the bumps in the infected area wipe clean with rubbing alcohol,  yes rubbing alcohol,  trust me, it will burn but it works,There is a cream called kitikiti  small white bottle with an red eagle on it and black top, may cost $7 to $12, you can order online or probably find in a hair  store, its oil free, you rub in the infected area. clean the infected area  2 to 3 times a day with a clean rag or cotton rounds,use witch hazel to clean, use alcohol  when plucking  hairs and popping bumps only. use the cream morning and night. Stay consistent pluck the hairs every 2 to 3 days, if you do this for 3 weeks it will go away, you may still have scar depending on How long you had folliculitis, but the results will be crazy. As far as shampoo, just use something that's for dandruff/ dry scalp,  head and shoulders, original t-gel,  selsun blue, any of those are fine, the more you wash the better.

If you consider when treating empirically with Cipro (empirical is defined as"" relying on quackery "", ""verifiable through experiment &quot  the doctor assumes the experiment will have a positive outcome despite the following: 1) he is prescribing Cipro for a bacteria already known to be ""unsusceptible "" to Cipro.  NGU is unsusceptible to Cipro but in Alberta it's OK to ""treat "" with Cipro  2) he is prescribing Cipro for ""possible UTI "" or suspected prostatitis whereby the doctor admits he has not isolated the bacteria but assumes it will be susceptible to Cipro because as he explains it to the patient, it is "" a very powerful but very safe drug "" 3) he has no idea what the patients toxicity threshold is when Cipro attacks all connective tissue (crippled) or what happens after the blood/brain barrier is breached (psychotic) 4) he has not heeded the CPS (manufacturer recommendations), FDA warnings and black box label.  It seems possible that the odds your life will be ruined by Cipro are greater than the college ruling in your favor against a doctor (for quackery ). In the case of the culture of blame vs the college's counter culture (the cult of the illusion of legitimacy) who really deserves to be marginalized here? Wouldn't it make sense for doctors to heed the CPS (manufacturer recommendations ), FDA warnings and black box label instead of the college's protocols? 2 likes, 5 replies "

Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/collegian-calculus-and-the-vaguely-possible-protocol-672585,Collegian calculus and the vaguely possible protocol ,"The college has no authority or credibility because of it's own numbers. Their word cannot be used in court as the public's attorney would immediately call attention to these numbers (the sum totals of their investigations). How many of the college's rare rulings (against a doctor) are related to a sexual offense as opposed to quackery? The fact of the matter is if we applied pure math to the college's numbers it would be necessary to throw them all out. Recalling our last dicussion on collegian calculus we discovered the vast majority of of the college's rulings (against a doctor) were of a sexual nature and had little to do with the practice of medicine or public safety.  How could this be possible? These numbers represent an anomaly too large to ignore and as a result bring into question every decision the college ever made.  Why was the college's weak protocol ever substituted for the manufacturer recommendations for Cipro? Someone at the college suggested medicine is not an exact science but is that still valid when it is engineered to be so? Would it be difficult or confusing to direct blame of a malpractice if doctors follow this thin, engineered protocol rather than the CPS. Is this the real reason why somehow the college's protocol which relies on only a single vague possibility (empirical treatment for possible UTI) came to replace the CPS and has allowed great quantities of Cipro to be pumped compared to if the necessary safety protocols had to be followed? For instance the manufacturer advises susceptibility tests be performed (in a test tube, not the college's way). In addition if NGU is suspected, which is the leading cause of bladder infection in young adult males (possible UTI), then a concurrent regimen of doxycycline would be necessary to prevent risk of a superinfection which is an exponential   resulting in cell destruction and mutation. The reason being that any bacteria unsusceptible to Cipro is propogated exponentially as a mutated strain instead of being killed. So how does that translate to a human testsubject? If you consider the path of NGU (travels through the penis, then testicles then prostate), when Cipro is introduced the NGU is propogated exponentially creating a localized trauma (in your penis).  The results of this experiment can be seen in nature. Say you have a crossbow with a stored energy of 200 lbs. It has stirrups for your feet and your boots are too big. As you are pulling back the bolt to full draw, the stirrups slip off your toes and the knock is driven back into your penis with a concentrated force. A couple days later your penis may appear swollen but the next morning you awake to find your penis looking shriveled and deflated. This condition does not improve and when you see the doctor he tells you there is a 50/50 chance your penis could eventually grow back as it has sustained significant localized trauma. The similarity to a superinfection ends there as one is an unfortunate accident and the other is a deviant malpractice. In truth this could be accomplished with a single well placed blow with a 24 oz framing hammer which represents the blunt instrument that is the college's protocol.  The college would have you believe that the sheer sophistication of their doctors would completely make up for their primitive protocol but the only way to know if a bacteria is susceptible to Cipro is with a susceptibility test.  To believe this could be detected by the naked eye or by using some innate sixth sense or superior powers of reasoning and deduction is more evidence of the college's elitist counter culture. Obviously it is crucial our institutions are legitimate even if their word is no good in an actual court of law. The college's counter culture is too cynical, partisan, biased and incapable of empathy for the public if they can only see what is vaguely possible and not the actual truth. There is no point sitting back waiting for the rest of the civilized world to decide when empirical treatment with Cipro will be banned as this only lends to the illusion our institutions have not been complicit in these cruelly calculated experiments when they most certainly are. Supposedly this is a complicated issue but can no one recall "" What a tangled web we Weave "" or Pandora's box? That is where our governments store their Cipro.  At this juncture I am asking for a federal intervention in the form of a nation wide ban on empirical treatment with Cipro.  The practice of medicine is provincial jurisdiction but reporting the side effects of Cipro is federally mandated.  The college's elitist counter culture and their refusal to table the relevant warnings in the CPS or the German studies I submitted to both the college and the ministry of health in 2001/2002 , preclude them from being able to draw the necessary parallels to ascertain what the side effects of Cipro even are. That and the fact that their own experiment, where the outcome is already assumed, lacks the controls of a proper experiment and compromises the people's empirical data  . In the many letters I wrote to the college/ government in that time period I implored them to explain how this protocol could be adequate or even consistent with basic human rights. But in 16 years time I have received no answer.  There can be no meaningful discussion in Alberta or anywhere in Canada if our regional authorities have nothing to say because there is nobody capable of plugging the gaping hole in their feeble protocol (bluntest of instruments). Until empirical treatment with Cipro is banned, the public will continue to be at the mercy of the whims of the college's sophisticates who believe they can ascertain susceptibility to Cipro through visual examinations and superior instincts and reasoning. The existence of the college's blunt instrument is clear evidence of their animus towards the public.  0 likes, 2 replies "
Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/cipro-superinfection-the-possibly-rare-but-not-so-random-reverse-lottery--674123,CIPRO SUPERINFECTION: the possibly rare(but not so random reverse lottery),"For those of you following my series on collegian calculus you may recall I used the college's own numbers to demonstrate how it works but then using the rules of pure math was forced to throw all their numbers out(the large anomoly hidden inside the token numerator). But even if the college's numbers can't be used for scientific purposes ( empirical data), I would like to call attention to an error I made in my original calculation.  I wish I had somebody to point out these mistakes as I do not wish to appear overtly biased or even subconsciously as was the case here. I will admit the college's animus towards the public (their blunt instrument) was the cause of my internalized bias which led me to err even though something was nagging at me the whole time that my math was suspect. I won't apologize too loudly however as the error led to an epiphany.  You will recall how I eliminated 100 from 120( ruling against a doctor over a 10 year period) to approximate how many of the remainder were conventional cases of malpractice not sexual impropriety.  So I figured 20/6500 was a solid approximation but technically that was wrong because I failed to subtract 100 from the denominator as well. 20/6400 is the correct ratio which yields .003125, a difference of .000048 and using rules of significant digits still rounds to 3/1000. In other words in a population of 6500, 100 people could be eliminated from the equation yet the ratio remains the same.  So which ratio would be considered the threshold to be still considered ""rare "". Or in terms of the government, what numbers would they consider acceptable collateral damage in their experiments with Cipro? 100/6500?, 3/1000?, 1/1000? Unfortunately we cannot know how rare superinfection is because the college's numbers don't qualify as scientific data given the anomalies present.  The fact is this whole argument about Cipro side effects being rare is just a distraction, a smoke screen or a red herring. Is it necessary to quantify a ratio when you consider the issue is not so much the rarity of side effects but the certainty? Rare may seem a practical argument but if it's not random then it's irrelevant. CIPRO SUPERINFECTION is unavoidable given the warnings and safety protocols were eliminated in favor of the college's thin, engineered protocol. Yet it's totally foreseeable given the knowledge of the actual manufacturer recommendations and the proper testing (in a test tube). Cipro Superinfection is not rare, but an engineered reverse lottery which is not random, but rigged, given the event is foreseeable and preventable if it weren't completely ignored.  0 likes, 2 replies "

About 4 weeks ago I was given a course of penicillin after many visits to gp for a cold which was lasted over 5 weeks as it turned out.  I had a very red throat and most awful choking   and lost my voice completely not good as I sing in a choir and it is back but not quite 100%.  After I finished the penicillin I had an upset digestive system like all antibiotics but also developed was I thought was an UTI (have had them before after colds).  I saw a doctor not my usual one but had seen him in the past. He thought thrush and prescribed for that ( I did not think it was however) I returned a week later when I got blood in urine and a sample was taken and sent to lab.  He said in the meantime I will prescribe antibiotics.  So far so good.  I collected the prescription and went home.  I was alarmed when I saw he had prescribed ciprofloxacin 500 2 a day for 7 days.  I would have been none the wiser except my husband had a really bad reaction to these some years ago.  Was burning hot itched and said he felt like he would explode fortunately the gp stopped the cipro and gave him antihistamine and he was soon better.  I took one tablet and whether or not it was just anxiety I started to feel a bit spaced out.  I went back in the afternoon  to ask the gp for advice he said it was just anxiety and not a reaction.  He said it was quite safe  and he himself had taken it and in all his years as a gp had only one person have a reaction.  I felt somewhat reassured but not completely happy.  I completed the course and did not really have any side effects except for some digestive discomfort which I would expect but no Diarrhoea.  After finishing the last tablet I returned to gp and he confirmed the sample was positive for an infection.  This was one week ago.  I have  had some trouble in the last week with digestive system to be expected as I have existing digestive problems but is settling down now. I thought my neck arthritis was flaring up as during the time I was ill I was doing a lot of laying around and no neck exercises which I usually do.  The pain was exactly the same.  Now I am feeling stressed waking really early (have had this before).  Rhinitis is flaring up but that could be to do with a change of medication.  I have odd itching sensations which last seconds and can be anywhere on the body.  My scalp is itchy and I have like tension headache and sinus facial pain, although the neck arthritis causes headaches and head pain.   Once again I have had all these in the past either as anxiety or separate problem.   I am so concerned that this might be the start of long term effects of this drug as I have read so many terrible experiences from patients who have taken cipro.   I have an appointment in 2 weeks with my usual gp and I am going to tell her that I never want to take them again.  What do you all think, could this be that start of problems related to this drug or just my normal symptoms.  I thankfully don't take nsaids and I am a steroid  responder so will not take these unless there is no alternative.  I understand these can make symptoms worse.   I was hoping to go back to my choir tomorrow and hope it will take my mind of things.  Thanks for reading this.

I was advised by my doctor that I will need to take Prozac for the rest of my life.  After taking prozac for one week I began to feel more anxious, and unable to sleep at night. At the 2 week mark my last dosage was terrible. Had insomnia, could not not sleep. my body wanted to sleep but my brain was awake. I also felt hot flashes every night, so I decided to stop completely the medication. the first 2 days i was unable to fall asleep. i decided to buy Sleepytime Herbal tea to calm my nerves and drink the tea everynight before bedtime and it has helped me a lot.  Ive been off Prozac 1 week and I feel its getting better and better each day.  I don't have any symptoms during the day.   The only symptoms I experience it's only at night time. but the Tea does help you eventually fall asleep. I do wake up at night to use a restroom.  i also have dreams (not nightmares)  and I pray to my God everynight. Prozac is not good at all.  It blocks your natural hormones in producing  and your body will always need to rely on a pill to get better. I don't think so. 0 likes, 5 replies "

Fluoxetine,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/prozac-withdrawal-cold-turkey--617084,PROZAC WITHDRAWAL COLD TURKEY!!!,"So i decided i’m going to start keeping track of my symptoms through my fluoxetine (prozac) withdrawal process. I have decided to stop cold turkey regardless of all the reviews and opinions on forums, WebMD, etc. i was the closest to   that I have ever been the other night and i realized it has been like this for quite some time now. I realized that my   thoughts were getting worse and I don’t know if the medicine just never really worked, or stopped working, or what. I’ve had major   since I was 15 and I used to self harm everyday. Being on Prozac did not help with this. maybe at first, but not for long. i continued to self harm and almost took my life the other night. SO this is why i decided to stop cold turkey because i believe i am strong and can handle it, and i’ve always kind of just did my own thing with medications before consulting a doctor. also, i can’t get in to see him again for 3 months, and  i don’t have the patience for that. For example, I was on propranolol for 6 months and it made me VERY SICK. it was supposed to treat migraines or prevent them but ended up giving me all the things it was supposed to HELP with ( , arrhythmia,  , etc) so i went off this cold turkey back in May of this year. It was a nasty withdrawal process but i turned out just fine and feel much better off of it.  I apologize this is so long but this time around i’m tracking day by day symptoms that stand out the most and cause me the most pain for ANYONE to reference if they decide to stop Prozac cold turkey as well.  I will continue to update this as I go!  - as a side note, i am also on 0.5mg of clonazepam twice a day, as well as   at night for my insomnia so my withdrawal may not be as severe as someone who’s taking JUST Prozac.

So I get folliculitis on my chest and forehead for a year now. Had lot of stress before it occurred, so had a weak immune system. First I was using Nizoral for months 2x daily - drying my skin like crazy but it was the only thing that kept my rash at bay. As soon as I’d give it a break I’d be covered again, so it didn’t make it go away just contained it. Then my doc put me on antibiotics and I was given acne cream (???), needless to say both made it worse as my skins natural flora got f***ed from it. So that was it for doc help, looked for natural remedies instead. The first thing that actually cleared up my skin on my chest was aqua marina from Lush. It contains calamine, sea salt, sea moss and had done absolute wonders. So simple, but so amazing. First I was washing my skin daily 2x with it, completely replacing Nizoral. Now I just do it every few days, and I haven’t had any break outs at all - for months now it’s been pretty damn clear. However with my forehead it was much more complicated as I needed to moisturise my skin to prevent wrinkles and use makeup when I’m at work. To replace moisturiser for face I now use organic 99,9% aloe Vera gel - it has done wonders!!! Moisturises, heals skin, keeps folliculitis at bay at the same time. I even use it as moisturiser/primer under makeup now. For makeup I stopped using foundation and now use a mineral powder, as folliculitis feeds off oils. Oh and using head and shoulders as shampoo and washing forehead as well. And finally my forehead folliculitis has cleared as well!! However this isn’t the only things I’ve changed: I’m taking turmeric capsules, zinc and probiotics (2x recommended amount). As I realised I need to internally fix the problem. My skin is so nice and clear now, despite the fact that I had days I was so covered that I couldn’t leave the house. So my suggestions: - head and shoulders as shampoo - aqua marina from lush (let it sit 5 mins before washing off) - probiotics (I got the ones with best customer average rating from amazon) and take double amount  - 140 mg zinc  - 400 mg turmeric - do not use moisturiser where you get folliculitis outbreak! Instead use Aloe Vera - sunbed or sunbathing at least 1x every 1/2 weeks - fries them little b******s off Hope this helps someone in similar situation as I was a year ago!

Folliculitis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/scalp-folliculitis-help--694610,Scalp Folliculitis  Help!,"I'm 50, live in NW United States.  I try to remember to take 10,000 iu Vitamin D every couple of weeks during the Winter which is very dark up here.  (More recent studies on Vitamin D shows many of us need a lot higher dosage than previously suggested.) I forgot this year and only took it twice.  I didn't spend much time outside this last Summer and Fall which I'm sure exacerbated my deficiency.  Haven't gotten a blood test yet.  That's the only way to know for sure. I also have a small bout of Gout on my toe, only second time it has happened (first time was agonizing).  The reason I mention this is after days of research I think I there is a realistic possibility I have moderately impaired Kidney function as Folliculitis can also be more common with Kidney Disease.  But otherwise my health seems fine with no other noticeable health symptoms. A couple months ago I got scalp Folliculitis.  I missed the cutoff for health insurance this year (didn't realize they moved it from Dec 31 to 15th - I'm Self Employed).  So wanted to avoid the doctor visit if possible.  Tea Tree shampoo, T-Sal Shampoo and Tea Trea oil on the scalp (1/3 oil, 2/3 water in a little spray pump) along with Turmeric supplements didn't solve it.  So I read and read and read about the condition and determined it had to be bacterial that required antibiotics.  My son had leftover (unexpired doxycycline from his acne treatment)  I read and read more about antibiotics, when and when not to take them, which ones work best for which conditions, and find doxycycline is one of the most recommended antibiotics for the condition (and other skin infections) with relatively low chance of side effects compared to other antibiotics.  I took 100mg twice a day 12hrs apart for 14 days (some texts recommended 7-10 days, other said a couple weeks, others said 4-6 weeks.)  It was completely clear after about 8-9 days but I went to 14 days realizing the bacteria can still be there after all the symptoms are gone.  5 days after stopping the bumps are very slowly returning.  They are like large size acne and can get pretty swollen. After more reading, unfortunately I see recurrence is common and many never get rid of this condition! Yikes! I really want to avoid the doctor and more antibiotics as from what I read it is very very difficult to make it go away permanently.  Most Doctors I'm guessing don't really have a lot of specialized experience treating this specific condition.  I found a claim that someone cured it by curing a Vitamin D deficiency! I am going to assume it could be Vitamin D deficiency and give that a try along with keeping on the Tea Tree oil.  I've read for hours about Vitamin D before.  You can go to 10,000 IU a day without toxicity. It takes about 600,000 IU total dose usually to correct most deficiencies according to studies +/- depending on your level of deficiency.  I'm going to try 50,000 IU a week or 10,000 IU 5 out of 7 days a week for a couple months and see if things improve.  I'm also going to try Smilax Medica (Sarsaparilla) root powder 1-3g twice a day as another user on here reported that cleared it but like antibiotics it returns.  Problem is if it clears I won't know if it was the Vitamin D or the Sarsaparilla but at this point I'm kind of freaked out as I've never experienced any history with folliculitis before so not sure why all the sudden I got it except.. major Vitamin D deficiency!   If I have to keep taking the Sarsaparilla I will as I read it doesn't destroy the beneficial gut bacteria (flora) that the antibiotics do which I'm taking Florastor right now to get back after two weeks on doxycycline. Crossing my fingers it's Vitamin D related.  Worst case, I'll have to see the dermatologist, get the liquid from one of the bumps cultured and go on (from what I read) both systemic (pills) antibiotic, probably other than doxycyline (like Cephalexin or Clindamyacin), maybe for several weeks? combined with topical (water based gel) 2% antibiotic (Mupirocin I suspect) as I think that is maybe the only combination that can really cure it but it will take a long time to restore my beneficial gut bacterial.   Also heard to put the ointment in your nostrils as the Staph bacteria can ""seed"" there.  But really hoping the Vitamin D will make it go away! 1 like, 1 reply "

Recovery had been a nightmare. So far have had, in this order: the big walking boot, the small walking boot, an ""appropriate running shoe (wide), back to the small walking boot, back to the big walking boot today. I have been on Norco and then an Rx for inflammation (28 days, 2x a day). Pain is getting worse. I had 12 PT sessions that are over with the PT saying ""There is no more he can do for you."" I have had an Xray and yesterday an MRI.  Results of MRI - perfectly normal healing. Translation -  you are still swollen and that is what is causing your severe pain. So, back in the walking boot I go, but not before being administered a monster Cortisone shot today, directly in the big toe knuckle. Apparently my body is not healing as quickly as ALL of the other doctor's patients. I am the only one who has EVER had ""complications"" and this much swelling. I am 61, weigh 125 lbs, 5'4 and am in excellent physical shape. I eat well and take care of myself. So, I am having a really hard time understanding this recovery. Eight years ago I had a pin put in my other foot for the same issue - bunionectomy - and the recovery was done by now.  Oh, I am also wearing a toeless compression sock for at least nine month, every day. Yesterday, I was so depressed and in pain I literally could not function. Because my gait is off, and I cannot walk properly, my back and upper neck are stiff and sore. The frustration post-surgery is hard. I expected a quicker recovery time and swelling for a while, but not pain. I am in another forum on here about the Cartiva. Some of you reading this probably have heard my story, except for the MRI, which just happened. Anyone else experience a recovery like this. I am a very positive person and put my trust in the doctor and I feel like I should be patient, but my intuition is telling me something is amiss. I will follow the directions about the boot for 2 more weeks, when I see her again. Would love to know your experience with Cartiva if it was for the same issue as I have.

Maybe I should give the doctor a call to find out if I should not go work of what? Any advice?  1 like, 1 reply "

Fentanyl,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/paws-after-fentanyl-650342,PAWS after fentanyl,"Hello friends, I posted long ago, in a panic because I lived alone in Asia, namely Seoul, Korea. I was put on 'fentanyl, not understanding what it was, only to be told that my doctor felt getting off it was not his problem and believed it to be ""safe"". I have since traveled to Thailand and am on a medical visa, staying with my husband (who took a leave to care for me), and I now feel my doctors are good. I made a choice to go off fentanyl cold turkey (50mcg) against their advice for personal persons. After 2.5 weeks of suffering I don't need to explain, I am now simply a neuropathy patient awaiting surgery to prevent a major nerve from being pinched in my face. I am cycling through moods: morning is good, and energy is lost fast...some improvement over 3 days, and the last fraction of a patch came off 2 days ago to no withdrawal symptoms.  I am now suffering from PAWS, and really struggling. My specialist was surprised but overall pleased as my vitals are good despite 2 seizures, and I was prescribed tramadol (max 400mg a day) and I refused narcotics. \she asked me to return in 10 days for assessment. Additionally: ritalin 20mg x 3, Cymbalta (I am dropping from 60 to 30 as I feel it no longer helps much), and clonazepam 0,5-1mg, 2-3 times daily for significant panic. I have tried many, if not all nerve related medicines. I wonder if anyone can share insight on the duration of PAWS? Also, I forgot to request 5 days of ambien, or a comparable option as I am going days with no sleep. Thank you, bless you all. 0 likes, 5 replies "

I read it is used for fibro and is a mood brightener, enhancing serotonin absorption? the real hel is after. No one tells you that it kills pain, but it also kills beauty, your character, and eventually - your body.   I am happy to be free but facing the fact that Thailand has no mid level pain killers (i get the choice of tramadol, which my doctors feel is not likely enough, or straight to morphine or methadone and I don't want to go there - ever). Sleeping led me to benadryl which led me to the worst morning i have had in months.

In my opinion, sometimes quiet is just the best. Certain sounds or types of music, certain notes actually HURT to hear. A lot of the time, they bring on a migraine for me. I don't like loud, crowded places where you have to scream to hear each other talk.

How do I make people understand without coming out and telling everyone my medical history 😦 Temperature sensitivity I live in Phoenix, AZ... It's gross! The heat and sun really take a lot out of me.

Also, i've noticed that people's headlights while driving at night really, really get to me. Half the time, I swear they have their brights on and they're blinding. I do work a lot on the computer and at an eye checkup, the doc arranged for me to get computer glasses to help protect my eyes from the harmful lights the computers put off. She says that this could be the reason that I have photophobia. I haven't noticed much of a difference from wearing them yet...

You are not imagining the lists of pain and suffering that I've read here and also in other sections for other illnesses.

Finger and Hand Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/ball-growing-after-surgery-to-fix-cut-tendon-and-nerve-673126,Ball growing after surgery to fix cut tendon and nerve,"Hello, I am a 21 years old French female, about 1m55-57 and around 50-55 kg.  Last year while I was on holidays on the canary Island, I fell and cut my right hand on a piece of glass. After going to a very average hospital where they told me my nerve was cut and I would require surgery, I decided to go back to the south of France where I live and where I felt more comfortable getting my surgery. So by the time I got to the France, in a hand specialised hospital, they told me my tendon was also cut. When I got the surgery my tendon had fell in my wrist, which made the surgery a bit more complicated.  I was planning on moving to the Netherlands that month so I still did, tough it meant I had to change the person who was doing my physiotherapy to a new one in Belgium. He felt like my thumb had already too many lissions and that I would have to force and suffer a lot if I did not want surgery. After 6 months of physiotherapy EVERYDAY (but on weekends) he really believed I should get surgery to cut the lissions of the tendon tough my surgeon was really against this idea. I stopped going to the physiotherapy around this time as it was really affecting me mentally and that I wanted to find a normal life again.  From then my finger is doing much better, I use my hand like I used too even tough I still cannot fold my thumb, I saw two surgeon in France who told me that they were very pleased with the results. My sensibility is 100% accurate and I can do pretty much everything with my hand.  The problem came around 6 months ago, there was this tiny ball starting to grow right where my tendon was cut and fixed. I started to massage the ball very hard like my Belgium physiotherapist told me to do, and I was crying of pain and the ball would just get bigger and bigger everyday. Now the ball is big and it is becoming more and more annoying on my daily life, every time i pick up something I have an electrical shock going in my fingers and wrist, and my finger get tired very quickly when I write and it hurts where the ball is. The two surgeon I saw think it comes from the surgical wire that did not disintegrate itself properly. After an exam it turn out to be the case but both my surgeons are not necessarily recommending to get rid of the ball as it could fragilise the tendon and make my finger worse.  I was wondering how could the finger could get worse since it is not moving and I have only gained like 0.8% of mobility.  But then maybe they mean it more like the tendon will be painful when I move it? or do they mean it might crack??? I am just so confused about this because I also cannot find anything on internet about the risks of doing this surgery. And also the ball is very annoying, and preventing me from working longer, or carrying stuff. So I feel like I am still young and don't really see myself living like that for another 50 years or more. But then if I could lose all of what I have worked for, for the past 12 months I am not sure if the risk is worthy... If anyone could tell me more about the risks, and has anyone got what I did and did the surgery?  What would you recommend is the safest option?  Thank you, and sorry if it is not well explained but all of my documents are in French and I have translated the best I could.  There are picture of my hand after surgery, and the ball now as well as the exam results.  [ ]( )  [ ]( ) [ ]( ) 0 likes, 0 replies "

I had a mallet finger injury (pinky fnger) approximately 3 years ago. I went to the hospital about this injury the day after and had it splinted for 6 weeks but the treatment did not work. I was told I would need surgery by a nurse but being a bit young at the time and not in any pain with the finger I decided not to have surgery and decided to live with the injury as it caused me no pain. Only until recently have I learned that over time the mallet finger injury becomes a swan neck deformity and that is what I have noticed now. I've been to the doctors about it and now have an appointment with the orthapedics. The problem I have is I am due to start a new manual labour type job in the next couple of months and I am really worried about potentially needing a long time off if i have surgery as this will not look good to a new employer. The questions I have are if I were to leave my finger wihout treatment would it get any worse than it is now already? What kind of surgery is typically performed in cases like this? Do you think the possibility of being treated without surgery after 3 years would be basically impossible ?  My finger has never caused me pain or made me struggle to work or even do boxing but I am very worried about the possibility of future complications if they can happen were I to avoid surgery.

She went to the GP and she sent her to  do some x-ray and   for ""peace of mind"", the thing is that some days after the tests the fingers went back to normal. All the blood tests (including Rheumatoid factor and sedimentation rates) came back normal, except a little low vitamin D, and the x-rays were also okay so the GP didn't really bothered and since her fingers got better we also forgot about it. That happened about 3 weeks ago and last Thursday she complained again and had her index finger quite swollen as well as her pinky, over the weekend the fingers got better although her skin got a bit red on the tip of her pinky and ring fingers. She hasn't described any pain, only a bit of stiffness when the fingers were swollen, she works with the computer all day and her desks both at home and at work are not great so we were wondering if this could be a potential cause.

I’ve hidden it for so long. Well I’ve had enough of this and I want to get it looked at and sorted if possible. So the photos I’m attaching haven’t ever been seen by anyone except yourselves so please be nice. 😃File size is too big Ive uploaded the images to the following link. 0 likes, 0 replies "

The back of my hand was swollen at first but now its only in my fingers. It is harder to bend my fingers cause of how swollen they are. I thought it may have been from lack of exercise or water but neither of those have cleared it up. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Finger and Hand Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/should-i-see-a-neurologist--696926,Should I see a neurologist?,"I’ll get straight to the point. I have numbness in my hand muscles, loss of grip and I struggle to control my muscles, specifically in my hands and more recently in my inner forearms. In the beginning, I would notice symptoms first thing in the morning and when I would laugh, but as time has gone on, I don’t know what triggers them as I can have episodes at random times throughout the day without laughing. The best way I could describe the sensation is the feeling you get on a rollercoaster or when you go over a hill fast, but of course, it's in my hand. My hands feel tingly and my muscles feel empty so I struggle to control them. The earliest I can remember experiencing symptoms is around 6 years old and I am now 22. The numbness can last anywhere from a minute to a few hours, with the longest episode I've had so far being 6 hours. I’ve brought my experiences up to several doctors since 2010 and until 2016 everyone dismissed me and just said they didn’t know what it could be. So I had my first ortho referral in late 2016 and he through the idea of carpal tunnel syndrome out there and since then all of my appointments have been focused on treating the carpal tunnel despite me asking to look at other options because I did not feel it was carpal tunnel syndrome. I did develop what I thought was actual carpel tunnel in my right hand around March 2018 and those symptoms to me felt completely different to what I had been previously experiencing. I was doing my final university assignments so I was doing a lot of typing and handwriting at the time, which is what probably triggered my carpel tunnel. So the symptoms for what I believed to be a carpel tunnel were pain in my wrist, my palm, closer to my wrist felt very tender; almost like I had an invisible bruise. My hand muscles would get very tight if I was doing repetitive movements and it felt like I had a constant cramp in my hand. My handgrip itself didn’t feel any worse, but my wrist was significantly weaker to the point that I could not get enough pressure on my wrist to wipe the counter, hold anything up for my than 3 seconds or even cut my own food. I assumed this was a separate issue and since I was in a different city to the specialist I was initially referred to, I went to a new doctor. I ended up seeing 3 doctors before I went back to my ortho and despite the symptoms I described, they all looked at my hands and my wrist and said that they didn’t think I had carpal tunnel syndrome although something was clearly going on. I was told to rest my wrist and use Ibuprofen for the pain and the inflammations, but this only offered temporary relief and until the New Year my wrist continued to be problematic, but it has been doing much better over the past 2 months. When I went back to ortho, he suggested that perhaps I was bending my wrists and trapping my nerve so I was given wrist splints to sleep in and wear while I'm on the computer, but these did little to nothing to help my wrist. I’m getting really frustrated with everything now because after years of being passed around to different doctors I am back to square one and still no answers. I don’t remember the exact blood tests I have had done but I have had several over the years that have all come back clear. I’ve had nerve conduction tests and they came back normal but I have been booked for a repeat test that is coming up in a few weeks time. Today was my final appointment, I was referred to someone who I was told was a hand specialist and could take a better look at everything for me. I get there, come to find this doctor is a surgeon who was there to see if surgery was an option for my carpal tunnel. My carpal tunnel still flares up occasionally but I am happy to give it some more time to improve without surgery, as it has been much better lately. The doctor I saw today suggested that my symptoms sounded medical and he couldn’t do anything for me so my best option at the moment would be to go back to my GP and get a neural referral. In the meantime, I figured there’s no harm in doing my own research and see if I can’t find anything that I could bring to my next appointment. As I said above, I am 22, no health problems other than congenital heart defects, I am not on any medication and my symptoms have come and gone every day, usually multiple times a day since age 6. I am right handed but I experience the symptoms in both hands. I mainly noticed the symptoms when I first wake but they would usually go away as I go about my day. I also get symptoms when I laugh and until about 3 years ago that was the only thing that I noticed would trigger an episode but now they seem to come on randomly. My episodes now last longer than they did before and I’m noticing my inner forearm beginning to experience similar sensations in the past year or so. 0 likes, 0 replies "
