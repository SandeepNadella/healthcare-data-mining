Blood Disorders,https://www.drugs.com/answers/i-have-been-fighting-with-my-doctor-over-taking-456592.html,I have been fighting with my doctor over taking blood pressure medications?,"My doctor at Scripps has been trying to get me to take blood pressure medications for a year now. At one point his nurse actually told me that they didn't want to see me again if I didn't take medication. My blood pressure when they take it at Scripps is around 130/90. When I went in for eye lid surgery a few months ago at a different medical group my blood pressure during surgery was reported as114/76. When I check it at drug stores and other places it is never over 120/80. When I check it at home it is usually below 120/80. I use an OMRON HEM-775 machine at home and just checked it: 118/79 Could it be that the nurses and doctors at Scripps do not know how to take blood pressure or they are trying to get everone over 55 to take blood pressure medications? And I wonder if Scripps is trying to get as many patients on blood pressure medications as possible to create a large control group that can be studied in the future? I certainly don't want a stroke or heart attack, but on the other hand I don't want to be on medications that I don't need. At what point should I take blood pressure medications? "

Depression,https://www.drugs.com/answers/anyone-multiple-antidepressants-success-3220482.html,Has anyone tried multiple antidepressants without success?,I have had depression all my life and am now having trouble taking any medications due to severe side effects. I was on Effexor XR 360mg for years and although it helped my depression this year I suddenly found myself lying in bed all day with no interest in anything. This went on for about three months. I went to a psychiatrist and he took me off Effexor. I had to slowly decrease dose over a couple of months and still got severe withdrawal symptoms. I then realised that Effexor had been giving me insomnia and severe sweating for all the years I was on it. Since then my psychiatrist has had me on so many different medications. Some give me bad side effects and some give me worse depression. I wont go on any SNRIs like Effexor because of the sweating (I would rather have depression than go through that again). It seems to me that my body has changed and I can't take the strong medications any more. I will in future only go on a medication at a low dose initially. But what medication will work? Has anyone any suggestions?

Depression,https://www.drugs.com/answers/latuda-flat-affect-emotionless-dull-feeling-3342864.html,"Latuda flat affect, emotionless, dull feeling?","I recently was prescribed latuda for bipolar depression. I was hospitalized voluntarily and taking 20mg a day. My depression symptoms were still very much present but I had to get back to work and signed myself out. The psychiatrist who I was not thrilled with, gave me a prescription for 40 mg in the morning and 40 mg at night. Almost immediately my racing thoughts have stopped. Although I am ruminating about how flat, dull, and emotionless I feel. I feel zombie like. I am not able to do anything or find pleasure in anything. I have no motivation or goals. I feel like I lost my personality. It is better than feeling depressed but it this the trade off? I'm cutting down to 40mg at night and I see my psychiatric nurse practitioner on Saturday and have therapy twice a week. I was spending my day prior to latuda with racing thoughts, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. I was on lamictal and Trilafon for 5 years but the depression and racing thoughts were still present. I have tried lithium, depakote, zyprexa, resperidone, and at the early stage of my diagnosis back in 2011, I stopped because of weight gain. I am on latuda by itself and have never experienced this flatness and lack of emotion. My house could burn down and I don't think I'd care. A stranger could come into my house with a gun and it wouldn't phase me. Has anyone experienced this with latuda and if so was there another med that helped with bipolar depression? I'm loosing hope that I will find the right medication that will still give me somewhat of a good quality of life or I have to accept this is the alternative to being insanely depressed. I have never been able to really control my racing thoughts and this is the only benefit I am seeing from latuda right now. Any suggestions? "

My 78yo mother a couple of weeks ago was sitting on her porch drinking coke and chewing the ice when she suddenly started spitting up blood. She would simply clear her through and there would be a rather large amount of blood. It is bright red but not frothy. We took her to the ER where they did an EKG, chest x-ray, bloodwork, etc. Nothing showed up. Her o2 was in the upper 90's which seemed good for a 60+ year smoker. After about 1.5 hrs, it stopped. The ER discharged her after talking to her new pulmonologist (her old one retired). She went to her a couple of days later and she ordered a CT scan. We are still waiting on the results. She hasn't had bleeding to the extent of that night but occasionally, it will start again for a few minutes then stop. It seems to happen sometimes after eating but not always. But she seems to have no other symptoms.  She is in relatively good shape for a 78yo smoker. She has pulmonary nodules that have been being followed every 6months with little change over the last 7 years. She is on BP medications and her BP has been averaging around 150/90 for several months. She had a fem pop bypass in January (from the aorta) which went well other than a considerable amount of blood from the NG tube. My question is where could this be coming from? I would think if it was coming from her lungs she would really have to cough to bring it up. She said it feels like she can feel it right in the back of her throat about where the Adam's apple is.

The prescribing information pamphlet for Depo-Provera indicates that enzyme-inducing drugs may decrease its effectiveness. The prescribing information for doxcycline indicates that it may decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives (i.e. birth control pills). Because Depo-Provera is injected, it bypasses gastrointestinal absorption. The doctor that prescribed me the antibiotic advised me to use back up birth control as the information regarding these interactions is conflicting. Two pharmacists, however, advised me that these two drugs do not interact and that back up methods are not necessary. Another pharmacist stated these these drugs can affect one another. I have even consulted medical journals and the majority of these journals indicate that TB antibiotics are the only ones known to interact with birth control. I am very concerned about this because I honestly forgot what my doctor recommended and engaged in unprotected intercourse while taking the antibiotics. The pharmacist I talked to told me that taking Plan B would not be necessary because antibiotics only affect birth control pills (not the shot or IUD) due to a disruption of bacteria in the stomach/intestines.

I am taking Generess Fe.  I have noticed that while on it, I have more discharge than I did while off and I read that that was a fairly common side effect (and one of my friends had this, too.)  But 4 days ago after I had sex and went to the bathroom, I wiped and noticed some brown stuff. It was like the brown stuff you get before your period, but it was a slightly lighter shade and of much less quantity. The next day I saw I had some of what I was thinking was spotting, just like the day before. Yesterday, I did not see any spotting. Today, I went to the bathroom and when I wiped, on the toilet paper, there was a chunk or just very thick white(?) discharge that looked as if it had some brown spotting mixed in with it. (The question mark is because it wasn't white, that is just the colour of discharge I have been having so I figured it was white, then got the spotting mixed in with it changing it to a very light brown.)  I decided to smell it to make sure there was no odour. It may have been in my head, but I may have smelt a small hint of blood (as if it was spotting).  Every other time I have spotted, it was always a tiny amount (as usual) and it was always bright red. Then again, I wasn't on birth control the last two times I spotted. I just want to know what spotting is like, if it is different for everyone, if it changes depending on whether or not one is taking birth control, and what spotting looks like (colour, thickness, etc.) For reference, my boyfriend and I were both virgins when we first had sex together a week and a half to two weeks ago, so neither of us have any STIs or STDs.

I had been tapered somewhat from 60, 40. Due to the awful side effects I tapered down to 30 myself. Well the prednisone did elevate the platlets somewhat but the risks far outweighed the benefits. I kept wondering why lately I was urinating constantly and was so very thirsty. It didn't occur to me that my blood glucose level was elevated. I should have recognized the signs . Diabetes runs in the family although I do not have it. Well, last week my doctor decided to check and my blood glucose level was 400!! Also, I had noticed that my blood presssure was like a runaway train. NOW the doctor wants me to taper off in 10 days. I said skip that, and I'm tapering in just a few days at 5 mg. I'm on diabetic pills, a strict diet and now have a monitor to measure my blood sugar. I can't manage to get a reading on the stupid machine without sticking my finger 5 times. I am beyond P*****. I can't believe this crap. Of course, according to research, after this poison is out of my system things should stabilize. But what if it doesn't.

My friend said her father who is a diabetic had been hospitalized and he was already on the pills and now has to take insulin in addition to the pills. Situation never reversed. So my Hemotologist said don't worry things will stabilize. These doctors need to be on these medications themselves so they can experience first hand the devastating side effects instead of quoting some academic dribble. "

I'm scared I could lose a job that I love, but even that doesn't motivate me to do the work that needs to be done. I was on Lexapro 10 years ago (for about 1 year post SO separation and death in fam), and while it did help some, the sexual and weight gain side effects made me want to wean off.

I know that it takes 3 weeks for your body to begin getting used to it. I am having side effects. Some insomnia, and most of them are in the morning (I take 30mg at nite) I wake up with my heart racing, extremely shakey and dizzy and nauseous. Every day so far. I know everyone says ask your doctor. But I unfortunately am stuck with my Dr due to my insurance and don't trust him further then I could throw a stick...  So I am just asking for experienced cymbalta takers opinions! Has anyone else experienced this? I was in a very bad car crash when I was 19 weeks pregnant last January (baby boy and I are both ok thank god) except for herniated discs in my neck and back injurys. When I went to see this Dr 4 days ago, he told me I had a 102 fever (I went home and took it 7 times with 2 different thermometers... was 97) anyways, I've had ongoing sinus issues (living with 4 cats I'm allergic as heck to) and I asked, why would this new antibiotic he wanted to put me on help, if the last 3 did not. He said ""I have no clue"" hence why I do not trust him! Anyways, he wants me taking cymbalta, cipro (antibiotic) neurontin, tramadol and singular (for asthma) I never had asthma issues... anyways I felt this was WAY too much and am currently only taking the cymbalta, tramadol as needed only and Claritin for my allergys. I am a stay at home mom with 2 babies barely 11 months apart. So my main question is, (and yes I know it's different for everyone) how long did these side effects last for you??

I realised I was using it for reasons other than pain and it bothered me and I considered quitting and spoke to my doctor etc, but he said there was no way I should just quit for various reasons but the fact I needed the drugs for pain relief meant I needed to be on them, I just needed to be more responsible and aware with them. As I said I definitely struggled with this for a while but I also think the ‘high’ definitely wears off and 4 years in and on a very stable dose, there is no high feeling anymore, that’s all long gone, and I wouldn’t want to increase my dose as if I’ve ever had to do that due to pain, it makes me sleepy and dopey rather than any feelings of euphoria, so maybe my body has just got so used to this kind of pain medication that it’s made it a lot easier for myself to use this drug responsibly as I don’t get the feelings that other people have mentioned and that I got at the start of my journey with them, and so I have just accepted that I need to be on them, they do a job for me and that’s that.

Depression,https://www.drugs.com/answers/advice-lithium-overdose-2337073.html,Advice on Lithium Overdose?,"37 days ago my Mother had an acute lithium overdose. She quickly developed uncontrollable neuro-motor movement and extreme confusion. Within a few hours she was placed on a ventilator. I have been told two different stories. 1. To calm the motor movement she required so much sedation she needed the vent to continue to breath. 2. The lithium caused parts of the brain to loose oxygen and this hypoxia was causing the motor movement and confusion. She was on the vent 8 days and a feeding tube was placed. As soon as she was conscious (~day 5) there was extreme agitation and constant movement with very little sleep. Every now and then she would say a word or give you a smile. Only moments of lucidity. On day number 28 we found her living will which stated she did not want to be on a feeding tube. On day 30 it was removed and she was placed in hospice. On day 33 she started talking and was much more lucid at times. She regained the ability to swallow and asked for water and food. She been eating about 5 teaspoons of apple sauce a day. She is agitated, hallucinates, panics, gets scared, cries and only sleeps about 2 hours a day. Even on 100/mcg/hr of Fentanyl, and doses of morphien and Ativan. She is VERY drug tolerant. Yesterday they started her on Halidol and she has been sleeping ever since. They are going to slowly reduce the Meds and see if the behaviors return. I have been told lithium overdoses can be like strokes and the brain experiences permanent damage.  Here is my concern. If Mom recovers to the point she will be an invalid and in a nursing home her depression will be so overwhelming I can't imagine doing this to her.  Does anyone have experience with lithium overdose?

I have been on Seroquel for about a year, which was initially prescribed to help me sleep and reduce anxiety. At first it did help me fall asleep within an hour and stabilized mood. However, it is now taking me 3-5 hours to fall asleep and the withdrawal symptoms when I miss a dose include sweating, nausea, paranoia/ extreme mania and I will be unable to sleep at all until about 4-6 hours after I take it again. There are times that I will be going out with friends or have to stay up later than usual for any reason and because of the side effects from missing a dose it completely throws off my sleep schedule and encourages mood swings. I am happy with the anxiety reduction and mood stabilization when I am awake, but I want to find alternatives that do not cause the withdrawal symptoms I experience and will not completely dominate my sleep schedule. If anyone has experience in a similar situation or any alternative suggestions I would really appreciate any advice. I am going to make an appointment with my psychiatrist to discuss this but would like to have an idea what he might put me on to know what to expect and what has or hasn't worked for other people.

I did take the 2 pills that I missed. Then I called my doctor, but I couldn't get in touch with her because she had *LEFT THE PRACTICE* without informing me.

So we bought an emergency contraceptive and she took it within an hour of said incident. She had her period on schedule, maybe a day early on March 16th, although it was rather light. It lasted 4 days or so. Since then, we have had sex a few times, all protected, never had a rip or anything. We haven't had sex since March 27th.

She is due for her next period on a April 9 but is concerned given she hasn't had any signs of her next period. She is not on birth control but plans on getting on it soon. I guess my question is... Will plan B make her second period abnormal? Is there any cause for concern with the brown discharge or is it just old blood? It went away. Will she possibly be late on this period or is there potential she could be pregnant? I just am wondering if we should be worried. We are both young and by no means old enough to raise a child.

I have been on anti-depressants before such as Paxil, Zoloft and a couple of others that I can't recall at this time. However, never have I been told these medications are disassociative drugs. In addition to speaking with a counselor once or twice a month it was recommended that I take Xanax/alprazolam 0.25mg twice a day for four weeks than if tolerated I am to increase to 0.25 mg of Xanax four times a day. This prescription was prescribed by my doctor because therapy alone was not managing my uncontrollable boats of depression and mood swings. My moods would swing like a pendulum. One day I would be incredibly sad because of my chronic pain the next day I would be very mad for little to no reason other than my chronic pain was much worse than the day before. Everything the doctor did during my appt made sense except when she called Xanax a dissociative drug.  Isn't Xanax used for anxiety therefore it would be considered an antidepressant?

Did it still work?,"These questions are always so hard to ask. Anytime I have asked a question on here, however, I have always had great support. I have been trying to research on my own, and have had very little success. My friend had a little scare. She explained to me that she thought she may have left her tampon inside of her, but was unable to retrieve it. After she explained further, it did not sound like to me that she actually had her tampon still inside of her. She said that she didn't feel well, and became concerned that she was not well because she had unprotected sex the night before. I told her that I really didn't know that she would feel ill that quickly, but of course I have heard different stories before. To be better safe than sorry she should take an emergency contraceptive. I take ortho-cyclen, not to be confused with orth tri-cyclen. I became very ill last month, so there was a week the I did not take my BC, to avoid becoming more nauseated. I had heard that taking a certain amount of BC could work as an emergency contraceptive. I explained this to her, but also explained that I was not at all sure and taking the plan b was still the safest way to be sure. She took 3 of the ortho-cyclen, because she did not know if she was going to be able to get the money to purchase the plan-b. She took the BC at 2:43 pm yesterday afternoon. I told her to eat because BC makes you quite nauseated. She still became nauseated despite the fact that she ate. I told her that was normal because she ingested quite a bit of hormones. This morning she explained to me that she was still very nuseated, and that she purchased and took the Plan-B yesterday after work. That was around 7 pm. She stated that 15 min after taking it she could not keep it down, and vomited.  So if you have taken the time to read the longest explanation in Drugs.com history, I ask, will the Plan-B take effect if she vomited 15 min after ingestion? Will the 3 ortho-cyclen BC act as an emergency contraceptive, or at least help with the Plan-B? How long do you think she will experience her nauseated symptoms? And what symptoms should we become concerned about if she continues to experiences? And lastly, which symptoms should we be very concerned about if they occur? I apologize for the long winded explanation. I know it helps to have as much information as possible. Thank you in advance for your knowledge and great help.  -concerned friend "

I have been on a number of different anti-depressants and so far Viibryd has been the most effective - although for me it seems to have more of an anti-anxietant effect than an anti-depressant effect. Based on years of experience I largely consider myself to be I be some what resistant to the effects of anti-depressants - though Viibryd seems to have lifted my mood by a couple of notches. I also began taking Sam-e a few months ago and currently dose in an amount of 800 mg (400 mg twice) each day. I take the Sam-E largely for its supposed anti-arthritic properties. I have been cautioned about taking too much Sam-e while on an anti-depressant, however I have noticed no meaningful improvement in my mood at the current 800 mg dosing. My question pertains to the action of L-methyfolate as an anti-depressant. My understanding is that L-methylfolate's anti-depressant effect comes from allowing the body to naturally produce Sam-e. But is that the only anti-depressant mechanism of L-methylfolate? If it is, why don't people just take Sam-e? Is taking Sam-e and L-methylfolate for depression redundant?

I can't really remember.) Well, knowing my luck, the condom slipped off. He pulled out- but he wasn't quite sure whether it was in time or not. He said that if he did come inside of me, then it was only a little bit. We bought a plan B pill the next morning, and I took it immediately. ( I would say that we were able to get it right at the twelve hour mark. Not even twenty four hours had passed).  There has been little to no nausea. I did have heartburn a few hours after taking the pill, and then the next day I was horribly constipated ( which hasn't really happened to me before- not to this degree). I have little to no feminine discharge, and I have yet to start my period. I usually start my period towards the end of the month- so it should be coming on either Wednesday or Thursday ( I will update you guys if possible).  I am eighteen years old, and I just lost my virginity a few days ago. Sadly sex education really isn't a practiced class anymore, so the do's and don'ts are very blurry for me. I'm panicked about the smallest things, as is my partner.  We had sex again ( for the second time) last night, and we used a condom again. ( Keep in mind this was four days after taking the pill). It didn't pop, and it stayed on this time... but we're still paranoid as hell. Are my symptoms normal for having taken the pill five days ago? Should there be more symptoms? Should I expect for my period to be late.. or early? I would love love love some feedback, stories, advice- anything. "

My doctor said to take 50 MG the first week and then start on 100 MG the following week. My concern is that I have never taken any medication besides Tylenol for headaches. I am afraid this medication will make me worse. I always get really bad anxiety from school the most, as I am a pre pharmacy major. I have a major exam next Friday and another major exam the following week. I was wondering would Sertraline help me in school? I believe my anxiety is affecting my schoolwork but I don’t know if I am right. Usually a week before a exam I get really bad anxiety, don’t do as well, fear I will fail, get this really horrible feeling in my stomach, and my heart races like crazy. I also have an issue with concentrating and my doctor told me first he would prescribe me with Sertraline and to see a therapist. I did both but I’m afraid taking Sertraline won’t help me with school, I can’t afford to get bad grades and am afraid of failing. Also my doctor said Sertraline will help me concentrate in school better, is that true? So will Sertraline help me in school by any chase?  Thank you, Sarah "

Depression and anxiety are in my family; I've had it in what I consider mild to moderate form most of my life. I've read a number of reviews on different forums (I like this one!) and am apprehensive about starting this med, since years ago, the same doctor prescribed Prozac and Paxil. I couldn't and wouldn't wait it out with either of those since the major side-effect was a greatly increased, debilitating depression. I've been on lowest dose of Clonazepam for several years which worked but now have to concede that while it's a great band-aid, I have to try to fix the underlying issues. I know that side-effects will differ for everyone, but I'm thinking better to start this med on low dose and increase if necessary. One of my concerns is headaches; I've also had migraines most of my life (female, 40's). My follow-up is scheduled in 3 weeks; it seems that this med is much faster-acting than others, which is another concern. Hope I've provided enough info and appreciate feedback. Thanks. "

It seemed to work wonders for the first couple of years. But then it stopped working (maybe psychological), so i stopped it COLD TURKEY. Stupid thing to do!! After about 3 weeks, the withdrawal symptoms were horrifying, especially the brain zapping!! Then i read that it was NOT good to go cold turkey but at that point it was too late. Even felt suicidal. After about 6 mos, the relapsing of depression/anxiety had not only returned, it came back with a vengeance!! Dr gave me Cymbalta and after 1 pill, i thought i was going to die. The side effects were dehabilitating. I was tempted to call 911. Took about 3 days to get out of my system. Never took it again. I started having such sever panic attacks that i started taking Xanax (smallest dose .25) but after a month, i've increased to .50. It works for the anxiety but i feel sedated.. not sleepy, just lacking any motivation to do anything. I'm on ambien as well at night to help me sleep (5 yrs now.) I want to get off EVERYTHING. How can i wean off the xanax? or should i switch back to Lexapro? i hate my dr! He doesn't seem to answer my questions or solve my problems. I walk out of his office with MORE questions that i had walking in..  I guess i didn't appreciate the lexapro and should've just increased the dosage, rather than stopping it cold turkey. That's where the problems worsened. Now that i'm on Xanax, can i go back to lexapro? would it work? "

On the forum there are a lot of posts from partners whose s/o has depression and is unable to function (and they don't know what to do). As a depressive myself, I functioned so well that my then husband did not even appreciate I was seriously depressed, even when I told him. My depression (even on meds) went from not talking to being obsessive, angry, full of despair BUT as I have OCD, I was driven to have the perfect house and to present normality for my hyper kids. I had to strategically plan shopping trips due to agrophobia. I was not even aware that the fear of going out was a mental issue until I had therapy.    I learned as a result of a very dysfunctional childhood how to always wear the right mask and hide everything, consequently very little notice was taken of me, even by my doctor, of just how serious my situation was. All my cries for help were left unnoticed, until I was mid suicide attempt and stopped, realising I did not truly want to leave my children but needed help. I actually booked my own inpatient treatment. I still find it hard to be heard, I have had to cut friends off who were draining me with their problems and never listened to mine. I am getting more demanding as I learn more about my mental illness and realise that I have some very serious issues that should have been addressed a long time ago and that I can be my own worst enemy. This forum gives me a lot of strength to go forward. I'd really like to hear from others with a similar story and how they overcame this mask wearing and got the right help.

Depression,https://www.drugs.com/answers/recently-switched-effexor-150mg-lexapro-experts-589001.html,I recently switched from Effexor 150mg to Lexapro. And I need an experts opinion?,"So I have only been taking the lexapro for less than two weeks, but it seems like a miracle drug so far. I'm so incredibly abitious now. Since I was about 11 or 12 years old, I've been suffering from depression. Not until I was about 17 did I start Effexor because I had awful social anxiety with severe flushing. I am 18 now, by the way. After a recent break up in March, I spiraled downhill. I was taking eight to twelve sleeping pills on a nightly basis, floosying around, smoking pot everyday when I never had before, drinking, all that fun stuff, but I was incredibly depressed all summer. Until recently, after a hospitalization for taking too many sleeping pills, I finally decided I had to force a doctor to try to switch my pills. So the walk in clinic doctor switched me to lexapro. (It had been a pain in the ass to get to my doctor and to go on time) Another issue I have now is not being able to commit to jobs. At all. I just don't show up, yes I know its horrible, but now I'm thinking of opening my own online store, flipping a few houses, maybe renting one out, learning the guitar, learning to skate, sewing my own dresses, and moving to a state I've wanted to live. I also had a recent run in with my deceased grandmother, through the radio. I realize how crazy that sounds, and believe me I felt crazy, but my faith that there is a good afterlife is strong, and that is not why I came on here.  Another thing about me is I'm a blabber. This is a new thing, too. I've always been the quiet girl in class. I was thinking the other day about the way of thinking I had in middle elementary school, when I was the happiest in my life. I remember that I used to love to draw/design clothing and decorate things. I wanted to do productive things, even if it just included taking all the things out of my dresser drawer to reorganize it in a 8 year old's mind of organization. I loved to draw and paint, but I noticed in high school, I couldnt stand it. It's like the creative, ambitious part of my brain shut off in middle and high school, and now its been turned back on. I also have been having bi-curious thoughts lately? And I remember back when I would see naked people on a tv screen I preferred looking at women rather than men.  Am I crazy!? I want to know if this is something common or if Im going to sink back into awful depression in a month.  Thanks Nicole "

Hope this helps... Mary ISSUE: FDA is warning consumers and health care professionals about a counterfeit version of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries' Adderall 30 milligram tablets that is being purchased on the Internet. FDA’s preliminary laboratory tests revealed that the counterfeit version of Teva’s Adderall 30 mg tablets contained the wrong active ingredients. Adderall contains four active ingredients – dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate. Instead of these active ingredients, the counterfeit product contained tramadol and acetaminophen, which are ingredients in medicines used to treat acute pain.   BACKGROUND: Adderall, which is approved to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) and narcolepsy, is a prescription drug classified as a controlled substance – a class of drugs for which special controls are required for dispensing by pharmacists. The counterfeit Adderall tablets are round, white and do not have any type of markings, such as letters or numbers. Authentic Adderall 30 mg tablets produced by Teva are round, orange/peach, and scored tablets with ""dp"" embossed on one side and ""30"" on the other side of the tablet.   See the FDA News Release for pictures of the product.   RECOMMENDATION: Anyone who believes they have the counterfeit version of Teva’s Adderall 30 mg tablets should not take or should stop taking the product. Consumers should talk to their health care professional about their condition and options for treatment.   Healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse events or side effects related to the use of these products to the FDA's MedWatch Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program:  •Complete and submit the report Online: www.fda.gov/MedWatch/report.htm  •Download form or call 1-800-332-1088 to request a reporting form, then complete and return to the address on the pre-addressed form, or submit by fax to 1-800-FDA-0178   [05/29/2012 – News Release - FDA] "

Does this even work?,"My father had his right Kidney removed in July of 2016. He also has COPD. The Dr. advised he took all the cancer out and he did not need chemo or radiation. He had bloods done in October of 2016 and January of 2017 all of which came back normal.  This past March I returned home from vacation to find my father very short of breath and pale looking. He went to his primary care Dr for blood work and the very next day the Dr called me and advised to take him to the emergency room as his calcium level was through the roof and his hemoglobin was extremely low. A CT scan showed that the Kidney cancer spread to all over the lungs with a 7.5 CM tumor on right lung. The oncology team within the hospital advised me and my sister to make “arrangements”. When I called my father’s surgeon, urologist who took out the kidney to advise him of what was going on he was shocked and advised me that cancer like that does not reoccur for at least 5 years. I asked him why did he not give him a round of chemo or radiation after the surgery and his response was it was not protocol. I am fuming at this point. So you mean to tell me from January 2017 to March 2017 my father developed stage 4 cancer, so aggressive that a tumor the size of a lime is on his lung amongst others? The answer I received was “yes”  3 days later an oncologist who works with the surgeon shows up at my fathers bed side, mind you my father is on oxygen and this point, developed a fever and is so week he can’t even move and says I want to try you this pill called Viotrient. Explains that the side of effects are nausea, diarrhea and gray hair and we say yes we will try it. We move him with oxygen to rehab on April 12, 2017. My father has been on this drug for about 5 days now and has seriously declined for the worse, his breathing is 10 times worse, he can’t even speak a sentence without gasping for air, he is in a diaper, can’t eat and all he does is sleep. His legs, feet and abdomen have swelled to the point we might have to re admit him to hospital to check for blood clots. My father is 67 years old!  I am not sure what to be feeling at this point.

What is you experience with the onset?","I am (finally!) seeing a psychiatrist to discuss my recent onset of sudden depression about a year ago. I think there is a good chance he will prescribe Celexa, or a similar drug.  Me: I have been on Wellbutrin (bupropion) for almost 8 weeks which my GP prescribed, with OK/minimal effects quite a roller coaster of emotions. Though I actually think I may like to stay on this med because it's regulated my sleep and seems to help with SSRI's sexual side effects for some, it's at this point, clearly not doing the trick, and I've given it a while.  The question: How long do you give Celexa to ""work""? Though I see claims that it typically works in 2-3 weeks and gets better and better, I have my concerns that perhaps I am a slow onset type of person, and that rather then a steady climb up, it may be a bumpy one.  What is the longest you would give a SSRI? Is the onset ""better and better"" as it goes, or is it typical to have a roller coaster like wellbutrin (great for 2 days, horrid for 4, OK for 6, back to good for 2 etc.)? Though I know each person is different, and no one can tell me what my results will be for certain, it would be great to know in general what range to expect with this.  Also, did the onset cause MORE anxiety and depression for you? I gave lexapro a 3 week trial and it made me feel increasingly worse, so I had to stop. I believe my GP did not prescribe me proper anti anxiety meds for this onset duration, and I may have been OK had he done so. "

Depression,https://www.drugs.com/answers/continue-lexapro-2818012.html,Should I continue on Lexapro?,"For a long time I've struggled with anxiety/depression but it got really bad this year. I started taking Lexapro (well, Teva-Escitalopram actually) on April 14 starting with 5 mg for 6 days and then increasing to 10 mg. So this is the beginning of my 6th week at 10 mg. I was at a really low point when I began taking the medication and compared to that point, I am doing better. During these weeks taking it, there have been periods where I've believed it was working (I've felt more focused, interested, etc.) but lately I've been experiencing more lows and still a lot of pretty intense anxiety. The other issue is that I have bad insomnia. The two days before I started the medication I had bad sleep issues (woke up at 3:30 or 4:30 and couldn't get back to sleep at all) but prior to that I could usually sleep okay (wake up around 5:30 and not back to sleep, but I get up at 6:15 anyway). Since being on Lexapro I've had to take Trazodone every night and even on it, I often wake up at 12:30 and then 2:30 and then can't really sleep after that. I also get burning/tingling skin sensations, especially at night, which may contribute to the insomnia. Is there any chance that things will improve at this point? I would consider increasing my dose but I don't want to aggravate the insomnia and if the insomnia is never going to go away, I don't think I can stay on this medication long term (then again, maybe the insomnia is not actually due to the Lexapro).

I'm taking Wellbutrin right now; nothing else. Unlike some other lucky people I haven't experienced the ""added bonus"" side effect of increased libido, etc. On the contrary, just the opposite. I've been dating my girlfriend for a little more than a year and at first we were able to have sex on a weekly basis. However, the longer I took the Wellbutrin the worse the situation got. It's now to the point where we haven't had sex in probably 3 months. My libido's in the toilet and I can't get a full erection. I'm basically suffering from ED now, and I blame the drug. I'm going to see my doctor tomorrow. I've already cut back my dosage of Wellbutrin but because it has basically ruined my sex life I'm hoping to wean myself off of it entirely. I'm also in a much better place mentally now than I was last November. I'd like to try Buspar instead because I'm always tense, fidgety, nervous. I've always been a worrier. I'm hoping the side effects aren't so severe that they outweigh the benefits. I just want to get my libido back and be able to carry on having a sexual relationship with my girlfriend. She thinks I'm placing too much importance/emphasis on the physical aspect of our relationship. I know sex isn't the end all be all but it would be nice to still have that option when the mood strikes. That's no longer a possibility at all at this point, and it's crushing my soul. Do you think my ""plan"" to switch from Well to Buspar is a good one, or do you recommend I stay on the Well and supplement it with Buspar to counteract the sexual side effects? Apologies for the lengthy thread but I'm about at my wit's end. I really need some good advice and guidance to turn things around. "

After skipping a few pills, I had restarted my birth control on the Sunday after my period, which was the Sunday just before that Tuesday. My period had finished around Friday. After the sex, I kind of freaked out and downed 4 leftover birth control pills that I had not taken several weeks ago when I was supposed to. No more than 15 minutes after that, I purchased Plan-B one step from a pharmacy very close by and took it as soon as I got back. I estimate that I took the Plan B no more than 30 minutes after the unprotected sex.  Over the past few days since then, I have felt almost nothing. Well, my skin has been feeling strangely bumpy, which I think may be an allergic reaction, but I don't know to what. Earlier today I had a very short headache, and last night my stomach felt a little wierd, but other than that I have been fine (I realize it may take a week or several weeks for me to feel worse). The only changes I noticed were changes in my cervical fluid. The first time I checked my cervical mucus, which I believe was the next day, it was watery with some white clumps in it. I thought that they were clumps of sperm or something. The next day, Thursday, I checked twice. The first time I checked the cervical fluid looked kind of like semen. The last time I checked yesterday, it looked like white and creamy. It seems to still look that way today, judging by looking at toilet paper. I read that this is a hostile environment to sperm. I have spent the whole day today doing research. I found out that side effects of plan B can mimic pregnancy. I read that plan B thickens the cervical mucus and pregnancy MAY thicken the cervical mucus. I wanted to know when the cervical mucus was supposed to thicken on Plan B. I only found one source that gave me an answer, and it said that the CM thickens about 9 hours after taking plan B. That made me nervous because it seems like my CM thickened after a number of days. I don't know if that's about how long it takes for cervical mucus to thicken during pregnancy. Is this a sign of pregnancy? "

Emergency Contraception,https://www.drugs.com/answers/plan-work-right-before-ovulation-3370520.html,Will Plan B work if taken right before Ovulation?,My girlfriend and me were using a condom and it broke. Though it was only halfway in during ejaculation (not sure if this matters). A decent amount of the semen ended up dripping out onto the sheets (again not sure if this matters). We rushed to the store and she took the pill Plan B one step about 20 Minutes after. She uses a phone app to to track her cycle and the app shows what days she would be entering ovulation and the percent chance of pregnancy for each day of the month. The day this happened it said 20% but it said she should be entering ovulation in the next couple days as her last period was about 11-15 days ago. So i read up on how Plan B works and how it can delay ovulation. Could it delay it if it was going to come the same day if not the next? Also from reading the whole situation is there anything else we can do? or what the likely hood the Plan B will work? I am really nervous and scared right now.  Thanks in advance.

Depression,https://www.drugs.com/answers/appetite-loss-withdrawal-symptom-cymbalta-3457310.html,Would appetite loss be a withdrawal symptom of Cymbalta (or any duloxetine brand)?,"I am a high functioning Autistic with some problems with anxiety and mild depression. I take Cymbalta to help with my anxiety and depression issues and Vyvanse to help with some of my Autism symptoms. Both medications are known to suppress appetite as a side effect, however I only really experienced this when I began to take Vyvanse and after around a month my appetite went back to normal. I experienced no side effects when I began taking Cymbalta. I've been consistently taking 30mg Vyvanse for around 3 years and 30mg of Cymbalta for 2 years. Recently, due to issues with ordering with my pharmacy, I had ran out of Cymbalta for 3 days. So withdrawal symptoms began to occur. My appetite was lacking. Not completely gone, but I couldn't eat much before my bad gag reflex kicked in. By the third day, I literally had no appetite. I have tried searching online to see if this is normal, however I have yet to find anything about appetite loss being a withdrawal symptom of Cymbalta, only a side effect when you first take it. I took Cymbalta this morning finally, of course my appetite problems continue for now but even so I am still able to eat more than I did yesterday. So generally my question is 1: Is a loss of appetite a withdrawal symptom of Cymbalta? Has there been anyone else out there that experienced this? 2: Could there be a cause that isn't Cymbalta? For example, while I was off Cymbalta, I was still taking Vyvanse. Even though it hasn't affected my appetite in a long time, could being off of Cymbalta somehow trigger some side effects from Vyvanse? It sounds sort of far fetched in my opinion but it's still worth asking. "

He prescribed Wellbutrin XL 300 mg. and I was nervous. I dont like taking medicine... even for a common cold!! I was so nervous to start it that I literally waited 20 days after I filled the prescription to begin taking it. So far, so good. No major side effects, here are the ones I have noticed so far:  -I am very thirsty -a little dizzy but only sometimes -sometimes my heart rate seems faster and feels weird in my chest- almost like an anxiety attack except I really feel no panic or anxiousness. -on day two I had some abdominal pain like constipation  -and also on day 2 I was sleepy in the late afternoon I do not notice these side affects all day, only a few times and not all at once. :)  Today is day 3 and I have a little insomnia but I took the pill later in the day than I did the first two days and I am sure this is why.

Then it dawned on me that may not have been a good decision and I read my prescription insert that says ""If you miss a dose, SKIP it. Do not take more than one pill in 24 hours. This is important"". My questtion is- what do I do now? I cannot take these at 7pm going forward because it is 2am right now and I am fully energetic and wide wide awake! lol.

I have really struggled most of my adult life, and sought help about 3 years ago. I had a pretty bad doctor, and he didnt listen to me too well so i lost hope and went of my drugs which were doing nothing for me (Cipramil) After struggling with it to the point i just couldnt take it i went back to another dr and was given pristiq 50mg. This worked really well other than small side effects at first. However after about 3-4 weeks on the drug i was back to being constantly low and having suicidal thoughts and even harming myself. I went back to the Dr and he upped me to 100mg, which worked well at first (Again with small side effects-Nausia, Minor headaches and bad insomnia) But now after sticking out 100mg for a couple of months i am having heaps of lows again. I cant cope with minor situations, am snappy and angry, not wanting to work, have no energy and im destroying my marriage. I cant even look after my 3 year old girl for a full day without feeling depressed-which in turn makes me not want to be around her. I am seriously at a point where i am so sick of dealing with this, and i contemplate suicide quite often when im feeling low.  My question is has anybody had to keep returning to the Dr to have your dosage changed? My Dr said it is a possibility that it may take more increasing of the drug, as some patients are on 150-200 mg.  I am really concerned that it will just continue to wear off me. "

I'll start from the beginning. I've had anxiety issues for the past couple years. I ""managed"" them, but december of last year I decided I wanted to do something about it. I started going to a therapist which has helped a lot with the mental things. My dr. started me on Prozac 75 or 100mg dose I can't remember. I know now that it was too high of a starting dose. 4 days after starting I went into a depressive episode and could barely function. It was an absolute nightmare. My anxiety was through the roof, heart pounded, ""butterflies"" constantly in my stomach, couldn't sit still or concentrate, and I constantly cried. I missed a couple days of work because I just couldn't get myself to go. On the 4th day after telling my doctor what was going on she told me to stop taking it. After this I tried taking a few other kinds such as Wellbutrin and a couple others but every one gave me side effects. I started on Zoloft 25mg about 2 months ago for a week and then increased to 50mg and I noticed a little improvement in my anxiety but I experienced shakiness, tiredness, diarrhea, heart pounding, feeling anxious, waking up at night, and cold sweats. After a month they seemed manageable so she increased my dose to 100mg. I've been on the 100mg for a month now and I am still experiencing heart pounding, extreme tiredness, shaking, waking up at night, cold sweats, and I still don't feel my ""normal"" self. Could it be that the dose is too high? Or that I may not ever be able to get used to the drug? My body is very sensitive to medications, and I have side effects to every depression/anxiety medication i've taken so far. My doctor said she doesn't think the side effects will go away at this point since it's been almost a month since the increase and I still have them. So the question is, do we decrease the dose back to 50mg, or try something different? I am waiting to hear from my doctor what she recommends at this point. I appreciate any help! "

A family doctor prescribed Citalopram (lexapro) at a very low dose and it game me very strange mental sensations/partial hallucinations within the first week.  It scared me to death, I thought I was going to go crazy at work. I couldn't decide if it was a placebo effect I was bringing on myself, or bad effects of a drug.  The effects of Citalopram were scary enough that I swore to self-medicate instead. I began working out, going outdoors, changing diet, seeing a therapist, trying to make new friends, but not having much luck because people don't want to be around someone who's depressed, who's up and down all the time. I never feel good enough, have no confidence and end up being the ""little guy"" who gets no attention or love, gets kicked around and left alone, but I stand up for myself so it becomes violent among other males. Relationships and sex? Yeah, right, that's like some far-off dream for me that I don't even consider part of life anymore. My personality feels dead in the water. I'm lonely, scared, and feel very angry and frustrated to the point of recently having suicidal thoughts, and I realized I need something to help my brain change its patterns.  I have not been able to effectively fight my depression with lifestyle changes: I give back in to bad habits and telling myself I'm not good enough, and over-analyzing little things. It has become enough of a scab on my personality that I have become angry, frustrated, tired, mean, cynical, sarcastic, paranoid and just generally unhappy. I do not want to get out of bed in the morning, because I am so sensitive to every little thing out there in the world. Every situation seems to fall out of my control, and the world seems a bleak, mean and unforgiving gray place. So I have been researching WELLBUTRIN. Please share any experience you have had with it. I have read the reviews, but I'd like some advice on how to work with taking a new drug. I don't want to over-do it and totally change my lifestyle, but I don't want the drug to make things worse because I don't change anything. I want something gentle and mild that will just take the edge off while I try to reconstruct a positive lifestyle, getting a new job and a new situation. Physical side effects I can deal with, anything below the neck, so to speak.  Please help me with some advice how I should go into a Wellbutrin (or a better anti-depressant you've had success with) prescription. I'm too socially paranoid to make friends and go out and do things, I have failed in friendly relationships too many times, and I hate being alone out in the world, so I generally coup up indoors.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/lamictal-helping-anxiety-2823208.html,Was lamictal helping my anxiety?,"I've been blessed with the lovely triad of ADD (without hyperactivity), anxiety, and depression. For the past 10 years I've been on Concerta (my miracle drug) and Celexa. Lamictal 150 mg daily was added about 7 years ago to ""help the Celexa"" keep my anxiety (the most debilitating of the 3 dxs) down. Psychiatrists over the years have ruled me out 4 bipolar but Lamictal did seem to help keep the anxiety at bay... especially during stressful times and in the fall/winter when the anxiety can tend to increase. My depression is really a by-product of the anxiety... I get so worked up that I get exhausted & my motivation/desire to do things decreases. Never been suicidal but did get to the point once of not caring if I woke up the next day because the anxiety was inevitable.  Anyway, my recent doc & I agreed to switch me to Lexapro (from Celexa) about a yr ago because my anxiety was starting to come back. The change was seamless so I've been on that, Lamictal & Concerta since.  Now I'm going through a stressful time starting a new job. (I'm really hard on myself to master things quickly... which, unfortunately isn't happening yet... but am restarting counseling to help.) My psychiatrist left the practice a couple months ago so I'm seeing a new one there who I really like. I thought my inability to grasp my job duties quickly were due to my ADD (especially towards the end of my 10-hr shifts). When my concentration is poor, the anxiety skyrockets so I've been taking 0.5 mg Klonopin 1-2 times a day at work... which helps calm me but I really don't want to use it regularly. Saw my doc last week & she prescribed atarax in place of the Klonopin stating it doesn't decrease cognitive ability as much as Klonopin might (although I don't feel dopey on Klonopin, just a little less tense). I haven't had a chance to try it yet at work but I'm hoping for the best.  The other issue is that she doesn't feel I need Lamictal since I'm not bipolar (& she thinks it too can decrease efficient thinking ability) so I tapered down to 75mg 4 days ago (& will go to 37.5mg after a week then completely off the next.) I noticed being a little anxious yesterday (saturday... not a work day) but this morning I started feeling a lot more anxious (another non-work day) Tried an atarax which I don't feel helped at all... bummer. So, I took 1mg Klonopin about an hour ago (6 hrs after the Atarax). The anxiety has hardly decreased at all... It usually calms me within 30 minutes. (I don't get full-blown panic attacks, just inner restlessness/uneasiness, slightly increased heart rate and a general feeling that something bad might happen. I can still function but I get irritable, my concentration drops and my usually sunny demeanor turns to melancholy). Just wanting to know if this new tapering of Lamictal could b contributing to the increased anxiety... especially since I've been OFF of work since the taper started. If I'm feeling this anxious during my ""free"" days, I'm really worried about how bad it might get when I'm back to work in a few days. Any insight? "

The drop in Meto seemed to work pretty well. My BPs were running in the 120s and I was very happy with the situation. Then suddenly I started having trouble breathing again. So I cut back to 5 mg Amlod. Breathing improved but BP went up. Is it the combination of Amlod and Meto that is causing the breathing problems? I wish this could be figured out because BPs were so good while on 12.5 mg Metoprolol and 10 mg Amlodipine.

Emergency Contraception,https://www.drugs.com/answers/cramping-normal-after-plan-normal-women-b4-periods-3115500.html,On and off cramping normal after Plan B? AND is it normal for some women to have this b4 periods?,"My girlfriend and I had unprotected sex. We were not using any form of birth control. Before sex, I hadn't ejaculated for days, I also urinated before sex. During sex, I never ejaculated nor got close to the ""ending"" path. I pulled out several times to check my penis, of course, there was pre-cum. I would also wipe my penis every time I pulled out. One of the times that I pulled out, the pre cum was a bit cloudy. I did research on that, and found that some reasons for that cause could be the mixture of our natural lubricants along with the friction of motion, exposure to air (I did pull out several times), and maybe different chemicals ""ingredients"" per say, that the pre cum contains. I understand that pregnancy is always a possibility when having unprotected sex, but considering the factors (No ejaculations prior and during sex, Urinating before sex), the chances a slim. Still, we decided to take plan B just to be on the safe side. Now, yesterday my girlfriend was having regular symptoms that she can identify to those that lead up to her period, the next day (today) her symptoms are gone. She was having cramps and her breasts were bloated and a bit sore. MY QUESTION: Has anyone had on and off cramping? I am a bit worried because I read several sites and articles, and an early symptom of pregnancy is ""on and off"" cramping. Unlike period cramping, which is consistent. NOTE: she took two plan be pills within one week. Could this be the reason? Has it happened to any of those reading this even when taking one pill?

The odor is like that of stale blood but its always there, however, I have seen no blood during the intercourse ever. Also, the urine has weird odor (unlike how it used to be earlier). I visited my gynae one and half month back but she just examined it without recommending any tests and said its fine, although I didn't tell her that I'm sexually active.  This smell is bothering me a lot now. Should I take this as a sign of cervical cancer and undergo PAP tests? My partner doesn't have STD s and I have never been into sexual activity before. What should I do? Help! "

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/clonzepam-aprolozam-diazepam-or-lorazepam-320959.html,"Clonzepam, Alprazolam, Diazepam or Lorazepam?","I'm just curious how different people chose which anti-anxiety works best for them. I've been prescribed to all 4, and tried them all out. The first anxiety med my doctor put me on was Lorazepam(Ativan), and I mean it did the job but I was alot younger at the time and wanted something that has a more intense effect but stayed on Ativan for about 6 months and asked my shrink if she would switch me over to Clonzepam(Klonopin) and she wrote me my script and I got my bottle and those were alot more intense than Ativan, especially since I overtook what was prescribed to me at the time, which was stupid of me 'cause they didn't last the 30 days they are suppose to until you can refill them. I stayed on those over a year, didn't abuse them, grew out of that stupid stage and my dosage kept increasing and increasing. Then I was in a horrible car accident in the passenger seat of my best friends ride who was under the influence and crashed into an edison pole and knocked it out the ground and I cracked my ribs from the seatbelt. For some reason my medical doctor prescribed me Diazepam(Valium) and it was like real intense but calm but made me feel really good. I guess they can be used as a muscel relaxer, and oh boy... did they relax me. I finished my 30 pills and tried to get more but they gave me cream instead an I was pissed... how do you get prescribed Valium?! I'm sure it doesn't take a horrific car accident an broken rips to get them. And Xanax.. wow. As a teenager, I would steal my moms xanax and pay $5 bucks for a 2mg bar. Then this past month, the doc prescribes me 2mgs every 6 hours PRN and I got 90 2mg bars for $5 bucks and those little devils were addicting like crack. They already only last 3-4 hours tops, as opposed to Klonopin which is 6-8 hours and is now becoming a top favorite pill on the streets beating xanax, which is crazy but anyway, i'll never get another script for xanax again. 90 bars in 2 weeks, worst detox an misery I ever felt in my life, and I had to go to the hospital to allow my body to detox off all those and it was aweful. They don't last long at all compared to klonopin, the more you take, the faster they go away, as well at the higher your tolerance for them will get and that's the only pill I can't control myself from. Way too addicting and by the 15th bar consumed, you're just popping them from feeling anxious and they make you depressed as hell. So I would just like to hear about how other people react to these anxiety meds, and how they keep them controlled and what they do for you that you stick to taking them. My intention was never to get high or addicted to some of these meds, but I suffered from GAD since childhood and my life is just so much more pleasant without any anxiety and unfortunately I formed a habit to continulously take them so I don't have to feel any anxiety... which eventually I felt like I was in hell 'cause no more meds an the anxiety is back to destroy your life :-) "

When the fourth son was a year old, my oldest son's brain tumor came back, and he had to undergo treatment again, including brain radiation from which he unfortunately developed a brain injury and some developmental disabilities, but thanks be to God, his condition is not as bad as some kids have suffered, and his IQ is normal, and he is able to drive and work part-time. 7. After all this, I had power of attorney for my elderly mother and was responsible for her care. 8. While my mother was still living, after my youngest was in school, I went back to school full-time( my mother passed away after I had been in school for one semester) and obtained an associate degree. While in my last year of school, I started to have phobic symptoms and quite a bit more anxiety than I had had for years, so I went to a psychiatrist and he put me on Lexapro, which worked pretty well, but we lost my husbands insurance and went on the health insurance from my work (I had re-entered the work force by that time, after 24 years as a stay-at-home Mom) and the cost of Lexapro was prohibitive, so I went on citalopram. Nerve-wise, it worked pretty well, but the sexual side effects of this drug are something I am fed-up with. My doctor prescribed buspirone to help with this effect, but, though I noticed an improvement at first, it no longer seems to help. Also, I noticed that I was having anger issues (though I never acted out on anything), so I cut the buspirone dosage in half, with my doctor's knowledge. Through all the issues our family went through, my husband and I always had a terrific sex life, and this is something I really miss. I went through menopause three years ago, and of course, that probably has something to do with it. I did mention this issue to my OB-GYN, and he offered to prescribe Wellbutrin, but I declined, saying I would rather have a psychiatrist oversee my care (all my current psychiatrist has to offer is citalopram and buspirone). We have discussed switching to escitalopram in the spring, when Lexapro is scheduled to go generic (and therefore be cheaper), but I have been thinking about just tapering off the citalopram entirely. The problem is, I don't know whether my brain will be able to function without it at my age (I'm 55), and because I have been on it for so long. I know it is dangerous to abruptly stop taking SSRIs, so I was thinking about cutting each pill in half and seeing how I do on a reduced dosage. "

I am in high school and have been suffering with anxiety for a long time. I have always been somewhat opposed to taking medication but just recently got a script from my psychiatrist for lexapro. I took my first dose yesterday afternoon and experienced some slight nervousness/jitters about six hours after taking it that subsided. Even though my doctor said when weaning there should be no withdrawal, I decided to research the drug and came across many horror stories of withdrawal, including what seem like very painful ""brain zaps"". I am now worried that the odds of this drug outweigh the benefits for me because I do not want to put myself on a drug that will cause bad withdrawal. Has anyone had a successful withdrawal with no symptoms? Is this even possible? Think I might stop now while I still can and find either another medication or take a more natural approach. "

At first, it was a godsend. Then I found that I had to take more and more to get the desired effect, which was alertness and optimism. In addition to Ritalin, I take 90 mg. of Cymbalta, 1 mg. of Risperdal, 1 mg. of Ativan and 5 mg. of Zyprexa. About a year ago, there was a backorder on Ritalin and its generics, methylphenidate and methylin. I could not get my meds and ended up having to go cold turkey. It was awful and I ended up in the ER with convulsions. It was only then that I realized that I was addicted to Ritalin. Stupid me. Once I was stabilized at the hospital, the doctor told me that stopping Ritalin cold was not an option. I would have to talk to my doctor and get into ""a program."" The hospital then gave me a supply of a week's worth of Ritalin to get me through until I could either see my doctor or check to see if the backorder status was over. I went to see my doctor who continues to dispense the prescriptions, while telling me to join NA. I am trying to avoid this. I think my doctor over medicates and that I am on too many drugs. I need to get off of them, but will not do cold turkey again. My question is, has anyone else in this group battled with Ritalin addiction? I do not drink or smoke or do street drugs, so this is my first encounter with addiction. It is scary. I do not want to go to NA. "

Since I turned 20, I seemed to change a lot. I became more insecure, had a lower self-esteem, increased anxiety, over analysing my feelings all the time and experiencing mood swings. Once I realised that it was happening during certain times of the month and was better at other times, I discovered I had something called PMDD, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, where depending on your menstrual cycle your mood could greatly fluctuate. My DR put me on 20mg of fluoextine a day.

I had a late miscarriage and was depressed. Never been on an antidepressant before so I was skeptical. However my depression after the tradegy was too much to bear. When I decided to go off my doc said take 1 pill every other day for two weeks then stop. I know my body reacts fast to meds-& my doc said 10mgs was low and I'm seeing people who took 5mgs which makes me mad he didn't give me that dosage. When I say my system acts fast from meds I mean it. Anyways I made my own plan, ignored the doc, and went off slowly for over a month and a half. I had no issues except a lil weight gain. Well this May was the first anniversary of losing my daughter and I fell into depression again. I went back on lexapro 10mgs. It has been 5 months and I decided to go off again. Again I went off slowly for over a month. I'm sooo moody, tired, gained3lbs in 1week & I work out & eat healthy, & dizzy. I plan to go thru these withdrawals head on. This is ridiculous if a med can do this much damage in 5 months but im determined to go off bc i refuse to be on it forever. I am takin saffron oil pills that help with appetite and mood.

I posted a reply to my old question but I'm new here and not sure if that's the correct way to ask another question. Right now I'm taking .5 mgs of clonazepam and .5 mgs of Xanax XR at night. I've only been doing this for five nights. Prior to five nights ago I was just getting down to .75 mgs of clonazepam. The idea is to lower the clonazepam while introducing the Xanax XR. This is my psychiatrists method. My GP said I can make a direct switch as long as the dose is the same. I was at 1 mg of clonazepam three weeks ago. She wanted me to switch to 1mg of XR at night and dose again during the day only if I need to. I feel like taking both at the same time isn't safe. I'm scared and confused. Have a call in my doc and an appt tomorrow. Today I have a headache, nausea and am exhausted. Wondering if it's clonazepam withdrawal? Just don't know what to do. My GP thinks I should switch over to Xanax XR and dose it twice a day so I have some daytime coverage during the day and not pile it on all at night. I have bad daytime anxiety. This started because I feel like clonazepam just makes me depressed and foggy. I'm also worried about having to taper off an extended release tablet down the road. She says she will wean me off but the reality is I'm the one who has to go through it. Not sure if I'd be better off just trying to get off the clonazepam. It doesn't seem to be effective anymore. Is transitioning over to Xanax XR a good idea?? I guess I'm looking for experiences from those that have been on the XR and or both meds. Just not sure which way to go and being anxious isn't helping me make a decision. Thank you so much for any input. "

I went in regular birth control pills at 17. I had a severe reaction and couldn't handle the hormones. I had mood swings and was lashing out, even my mom didn't want me on it. But we switched to the lowest dosage estrogen birth control pill and I seemed to be much better. I stayed on it until I was 22. I wasn't in a relationship at the time, and decided to take a break from any birth control or outside things being put into my body. I felt great, happier, and actually lost weight (I'm very small to begin with but lost maybe ten pounds. I'm 5'1 and went from 120 to 110 without changing diet or exercise). Then I got into a serious relationship and stayed off of the pill and only used condoms for our first 6 months. We decided I should go back on and I went on the same lowest estrogen BC pill. After a month I started to feel depressed and moody. It was hard to get up for work and I felt hazy and out of it. I waited two months but felt the same. I talked to my doctor and we decided to get the Mirena IUD since it has localized hormones only released in one spor and not digested. It definitely really hurt going in but they gave me the prescription to put in over night to open my cervix and also 800mg ibuprofen. It was really painful but lasted only about a minute and I had really bad cramps the rest of the day. Otherwise fine. But I've had SEVERE mood swings and depression like I've never felt before. I don't want to leave bed, I don't want to be around people, I'm crying uncontrollably, and lashing out at people I love. It's only been about 3 weeks on it but I can't continue to feel this way.  I am definitely getting the Mirena removed but since BC pills and Mirena both have affected me severely, I don't know where to turn. I have been researching the paragard since it doesn't have hormones, which is perfect for me considering the hormones are causing all my issues. But I worry about coppper toxicity or hair loss or the bad cramps. Since my body is so sensitive to things, I worry I'll get all of those side effects at full effect.

I am diagnosed as adhd with depression and underlying anxiety.  Now all my scores are the same, but i am being given a medicine called buporipion. Now im concered, as ive done extensive research about how adhd often causes the depression and anxiety that females feel. In high school i was diagnosed as bipolar with adhd and they gave me anti depressants and mood stabilizers and NOTHING HELPED. After being on 200 mg seroquel twice a day at age of 17 i gave up. I failed out of school because i couldnt handle it. Im concerned im going down same path of treating symtoms and not the root problem being adhd.

Then i get behind and feel like i have a million things i HAVE to get done, or worry about how im supposed to get it done. It feels impossible so enter in the depression.

Depression,https://www.drugs.com/answers/valdoxan-relieving-symptoms-anyone-different-1781003.html,Valdoxan not relieving symptoms- has anyone else taken two different drugs to relieve depression?,"Hello. I'll try to keep this brief.- I have clinical depression and moderate anxiety disorders, diagnosed 3 years ago. Was on Mirtazapine for 2.5 years. Caused weight gain and didn't help much despite psychology, lifestyle changes- weaned off over 2 months to try something else, namely Valdoxan. We (doctor and me) havent tried SSRI's or SNRI's because they tend to cause GI upset and I have enough problems with that as it is. Obviously they're still a possibility but we wanted to try other stuff first. Was drug-free for about 2 weeks in-between meds and established that I can sleep perfectly fine 8-9 hours per night without meds- insomnia has never been a problem for me unless things are a disaster. Getting to the point of my post...  I started on Valdoxan 25mg 4 weeks ago and now I'm in some super-anxious insomniac nightmare. I think 5 hours sleep was the best I've had on one night in 4 weeks. I've tried several over-the-counter remedies to help, and am not interested in ""sleeping tablets""- not when the insomnia is medication-related.  I'm obviously beyond exhausted (though still pretty cheerful, considering), but I just cant sleep! The GP and i have been hoping that at the 4-6 week mark things would start to work out but its not :( So what next, is the question. It's not as simple as ""switch drugs"". We've seen massive improvements in my mood, thats the thing- I actually feel cheerful, happy, better able to socialise, less withdrawn- no more crying/ weeping spells, no more ""blue"" moods. I can't remember the last time I've felt so cheerful and not subject to sudden mood swings. But my anxiety has gotten WAY worse.  So taking me off this drug is not necessarily something we want to do, considering mirtazapine certainly didnt have this effect. But the lack of sleep and the worsening of my anxiety issues, plus the side effects of sleep deprivation (headaches, nausea, exhaustion) is obviously unbearable. And my good mood is starting to take a serious hit from the lack of sleep. So: the doctor is discussing the idea of taking a second-drug to counteract the side-effects of the first- I have no idea what shes thinking of, she was going to get a consult with other doctors and get back to me. No, a psychiatrist is not involved nor do we want one to be involved at this stage (we both agreed on this). Long story, but basically they're expensive and super-complicated here. My question: has anyone else got experience with taking more than one medication for a depression/ anxiety combination? Like it kinda makes sense- both my anxiety and depression can get pretty bad independent of one another (i can be sad/ calm or anxious/ happy), so maybe there isn't one magic tablet that would provide relief of both symptoms. Is it a common thing to have two drugs that each focus on the anxiety or depression? I am concerned because obviously the more drugs a person is on, the more chance there is of side-effects or risks. I don't want to pickle my liver. More realistically- I dont want my poor sensitive tummy to go nuts. And obviously I'm also aware that we've only tried 2 antidepressants- and they were both atypical antidepressants- Mirtazapine and Valdoxan. As much as i've been worried an SSRI would only make my tummy problems worse- it might not, it might even help since my tummy problems are anxiety-based. And they are supposed to be good for anxiety as well as depression. Has anyone got any personal experience with taking 2 different things, or any ideas? Thankyou for reading, I hope this post wasn't too long. Looking forward to your opinions! "

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/zoloft-making-depressed-3432114.html,Can Zoloft be making me depressed?,Hello. I’m going to start my giving you a short summary of what I’ve been through. I was on Paxil 10 years ago and I decided to get off medication and fight my GAD on my own. 1 year after I grew tired of doing it on my own and was put on Prozac and I was in it for 6 years. Around the last couple months of the 6 years it stopped working which is fair. The doctor tried to up the dose of Prozac but I felt like I was coming out of my skin. The doctor switch me to Cymbalta we’re i felt depressed (which has never happened to me) and I stuck with it and it eventually went away but it did come and go. However cymbalta gave me night sweats and my doc said I had to get off it. From there I went to lexapro which was a distaster. I had intrusive thoughts (which I never had before) and I felt zoned out. I tried it out for 6 weeks and gave up. I am now on Zoloft I was originally put on 25 mg and 10mg of lexapro while I was weaning off for one week.Then I took 50 mg of just zooloft for one week (those first 2 weeks were pretty pleasant ) now I’m on my third week of just me Zoloft and I have been depressed and crying all day for the past 4 days. My doctor thinks I am now depressed but I feel as if it’s a side affect form medication. He wants me to increase the medication but I feel it’s better to ride out the wave. He said he never heard of depression being a side affect of Zoloft so basically I’m here for reassurance that it’s possible to be depressed from Zoloft even if you never were really depressed and if it goes away with time? Thanks for your time ANY advice would help me rn.

My main diagnosis is General Anxiety Disorder. I'm also 51 years old and read that Cymbalta could help with an overactive AKA ""touchy"" bladder. Cymbalta (30 mg) seemed great for a few months, then I started to have headaches, especially in the am, some migraine and feeling tired. My eye site became someone blurry. Also felt more depressed again so wondered if I needed a higher dosage, so started on 60 mg a day. I felt very good for about a week or a little longer, then side effects like migraine came back with a vengeance. I lowered my dosage once again, about a month ago but kept having morning headaches. Also over imbibed one evening on wine (not really that much though) and had the hangover of my life! Since this happened I had nearly daily morning headaches, and weird eye site. A week ago I decided to start going off Cymbalta, and take a dose every other day. I took my last dose 3 days ago. I haven't had a headache for a couple days, BUT my eyes are acting a bit strange and this morning I could ""hear"" my eyes moving. Yes I know this is really strange. I also have some tinnitus. And, feeling very tired and a little lightheaded. Please let me know if you've experienced anything like this. Thank you so much and all the best! "

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/anxiety-med-refills-336761.html,Anxiety Med Refills?,"My doctor recently prescribed me Klonopin for anxiety disorder. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, he put 2 refills on the script. I like the meds and they have really changed my life, but I want to try some others to see if they work better for me, or if some combination works well. If I go back to him in a month and ask to try something else instead (like Xanax), will the pharmacy refill the Klonopin as well as the Xanax, or are there some federal laws about dispensing the same class of medications within a limited time period? I know I had that problem last year when I hurt my shoulder and tried to refill my Vicodin script a week early, they said I had to wait. I'm not a drug seeker and do not abuse my meds, but I like to have a large supply of them in case I have to change doctors and they are less inclined to write the script or if I am out of town (which happens a lot in my line of work). As an alternative, can I ask him to write a script for a med in a different class to try, at least until the 2 refills on the Klonopin are gone? I have general anxiety disorder, and use the meds to get through difficult situations (like parties or a first date), so any recommendations on classes of meds that might help would be appreciated. I am definitely looking for direct advice and suggestions, and not lectures about the dangers of medications or addiction. I am a responsible adult and do not have an addictive personality. "
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/heart-palpitations-anxiety-remnants-329988.html,Heart palpitations - anxiety remnants?,"A friend of ours died of a massive heart attack while walking down the street with her young daughter on August 10th, and we found out about it on September 11th. I was saddened, but highly frightened. Anxiety symptoms slowly started creeping in because her death caused hypochondria, cardiophobia, thanatophobia, and health anxiety. In the beginning, I was just scared of my heart, and that I was gonna drop over dead of a heart attack at any moment. Then, day after day I started feeling worse physically. I started having heaviness in my chest, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations. It all gradually got worse until September 18th, when I was riding the bus to school and had, what I thought was a heart attack, but it turned out to be my VERY first panic attack. After the panic attack, I felt sick, and my whole chest and area around my heart was numb for the rest of the day. I wasn't able to get ANY sleep the night before, and I hadn't eaten anything, so that made matters worse. Two days later, I had massive palpitations that scared me into going to the ER to see if there was anything wrong with my heart, because I couldn't take it anymore. They did a chest x-ray, blood work, ekg, took my blood pressure, and my pulse, and said everything came back normal, and I was in pretty good health. I was 400lbs at the time, so it was a surprise to me. They gave me a small prescription of xanax which I started taking scarcely, which was everytime I felt panicked. I heard about becoming addicted to those things so I didn't wanna have to rely on them. I wanted to beat anxiety on my own. I started feeling better shortly afterwards, until I saw a picture of our deceased friend on her son's Facebook account, and the symptoms slowly started coming back, not as bad as in the beginning, but still bad. So, I was told I had about a month to wait before I could meet my doctor, because we were in the midst of switching because of the quack we had previously. So, I suffered for about another month, taking xanax randomly, being extra careful NOT to OD. Doctor's appointment time came, and I was through the roof happy... until I met him. He was a f***ing pr**k! He seemed totally uncaring, tried to confuse me on purpose, and was only interested in telling me that physically I was fine. He didn't care about the anxiety or stress, and tried to rush me out of the room. I asked him if I needed to see a therapist or something, and he tells me to wait another week until I come back to see him. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I had already waited a month! So, fast forward today, and I've lost about 15 pounds, and am pretty much over the anxiety/panic symptoms and feel good about myself. But, the one thing that's lingering, that bugs me more than ANY of the other symptoms, is the terrifying heart palpitations. I don't know why I still have them, but I even get them when I don't feel worried or stressed, and it seems that they in fact bring on the worry and stress. I've become afraid that I'm gonna have one at any moment, and I can't get rid of that fear. I have that fear because some of them hurt like hell, and are very hard. I'm not talking about an awareness that my heart is beating. I'm talking about random feelings like my heart has stopped, then I get a strong beat. Kinda like heart hiccups. I only get them when I'm sitting up, leaning forward, and sometimes when I lay on my left side. If I'm laying flat on my back or on my stomach, they don't happen as often, and if they do, they're not that bad and I can deal with them that way. I also don't get them if I'm up walking around. So, I've been held hostage by these, and am constantly laying down or walking around because I'm afraid that I'm gonna get the strong ones, and that's severely interfering with my life, because I can't get any school work done, nor can I concentrate on my writing hobbies, or anything else that involves sitting up. I want some relief, and my doctor won't do anything about it, so I had to switch, and it's gonna take an additional two weeks of waiting before I can see my new doctor. The ER can't help me long term and they keep telling me that I need to see my primary care physician, which does me no good. I need help, and I'm turning ANY where I can get it. I was normal before all this happened. My life was normal, palpitations free, and I didn't have a worry in the world. Now it seems almost like I'll never be normal again, and it's depressing, and I don't know what else to do. :'( "

I felt almost normal and was enjoying myself, that is not to say that I was 100%, but I felt much better and I almost did not need the klonopin, but was taking it to prevent withdrawal symptoms. As of 2 days ago, I noticed the anxiety is back again at a lower level. I have been having night sweats for the past 3 nights and wake up anxious again.

I have to add that I did reduce my Klonopin from 1.0mg to 0.875mg a week ago since I felt like I did not need it. I then reduced it to 0.75mg for one day before the anxiety returned, could this be a withdrawal symptom of Klonopin? I am back up to 0.875mg again as of yesterday.

I have been in a wheelchair since 2001 - although (I NEVER let my disability hold me back) I was always able to walk enough (with help) to transfer in & out of the car, take care of hygeine needs, cook, clean, etc. In 2012 my whole world came crashing down! I was prescribed the anti depressant Lexapro for a depression that I slipped into when my dad died. I lost my muscle strength, my voice, my hope! After a couple months I told my doctor that I just didn't feel right, his response was give it time - it's not in your system yet! He was right, 6 mnths later - when it was in my system - I had dizziness, slurred speech, loss of muscle strength, more migraines, etc. I saw several doctors who said how strong lexapro is & how dangerous it is to go off of. So the weaning off process started. And the confusion starts - brain fog (couldn't even balance my checkbook - for someone that once went to college & majored in business management, that was heartbreaking), restless leg syndrome, anxiety attacks so bad they send me to the ER, social anxiety - (debilitating for me since i've always been 'the outgoing one'), couldn't stand, couldn't even write, no voice AT ALL, for a short time my husband even had to feed me! I even had to join a support group for antidepressant withdrawal/SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome. My emotions are all over the place. My husband helps me work out to get back some of the strength i've lost. I read aloud to build up my voice - which is slowly coming back! At this point you're probably asking why I don't just sue the drug company! Since I was disabled to begin with & there are no tests to specifically diagnose a reaction to a drug or withdrawal from it, I have no proof! [ I am now down to .08 of a miligram - my last step] "

I am writing as I recently switched to Wellbutrin (bupropion). My diagnosis is not really clear and is vaguely defined as depression/anxiety. I have been having problem with the ""lump in the throat"" (globus hystericus) for almost 5 years now. These were the main reasons that made me reach out for a doctor again. The tension in my throat was such that I could not sleep, focus, etc. I had a diagnosis of OCD before this which lasted for about 4 years but disappeared.  To get to the point, before switching to Wellbutrin I was on escitalopram + clonazepam. When I started with Wellbutrin I experienced many of the side effects: dizziness, nausea, felling of hang over, irritability, anger, sweating, etc. Unfortunately, some of them are still here but what worries me the most is that my anxiety is NOT going away. It actually got WORSE. The feeling of the lump in the throat is much stronger, sometimes it even makes me throw up.  I am taking 300mg Wellbutrin and clomazepam a 2mg 1/2 +1/2 + 1/2. I am trying to give this medicine a chance because escitalopram extremely affected my libido (which was the reason for the change). Is there anyone experiencing something similar?

Most of all, I tolerate this drug pretty well and it's also the first one of all SSRIs that noticeably do something. I get this mild-indifferent feeling which is good for social anxiety and worrying less. But even though I am not depressed and anxious anymore, I miss something a bit. Maybe a bit more joyfulness and more upbeat feeling, which I try to compensate with drinking energy drinks that give this feeling at least for 2 hours. Mostly I drink coffee. They also make me more relaxed (only if I'm in a good state of mind) and a bit more upbeat even though I have built up tolerance to caffeine. I think right now I'm feeling functional and am able to do more things and am a more chilled person, but maybe a bit more joyfulness especially when I see other mates laughing and feeling upbeat in social situations, when I'm more lethargic. If I'm pretty drunk or high on energy drinks, I actually be more upbeat and stuff like that and have slightly more motivation.  Since there is in my country no medical cannabis / marijuana, and I became depersonalized and anxious even in small amounts, that's not an option for me.

He'd previously been on Celexa and then Zoloft. He did better on Celexa at first, but then it seemed like he needed an increase in the dosage, but his doctor switched him to Zoloft instead. When he asked about switching back, his doctor gave him a Viibryd starter pack to try. He was ok the first day, but then became very angry and hostile for the next few days (not just to me). It's been a week and the anger seems to come in waves and then go away. He's also sleeping a lot more although he would sometimes sleep a lot when he was on the other medications too. Will the anger and aggression get better as he progresses through the increased dosage in the packet, or could this be an adverse reaction to the drug that means he should switch back to something else?

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/long-dose-decrease-stabilize-3435926.html,How long does it take a dose decrease to stabilize?,"... this week. So far I'm on day 4 for this decrease. I am waiting for this dose to stabilize to see if it will help me with my anxiety. So far the increase made me severely anxious. Not only did 150 mg make me anxious but it also exacerbated my tremors. Which I feel are due to the Effexor. I have yet to see any positive benefit of this drug for me. The worst side effects were the tremors the shakes and the severe anxiety. Even now I wake up every morning frightened nervous afraid unable to go back to sleep. I never had that problem before I love the snooze and now I'm so scared that I have to get up. Some people are telling me to get off of this drug and get on Lexapro. I tried that about 2 weeks ago I was on 150 mg and I went down to 75 and took a 5mg Lexapro. That was one of the worst days of my life. I doubt that I can withdraw from this drug in terms of the dosages without benzodiazepine. I will try to get low dose as prescribed. For instance .5 mg of Klonopin in the morning would help me a lot, I literally shake from Fright and then the rest of my day I can't relax it's all Body Sensations terrible anxiety I haven't felt like this since I was 19. I think I tend to do better on ssris. I'm very resentful of the woman doctor Who put me on Effexor. This drug is so dangerous if I miss even a couple of hours of regular dosage I go through withdrawal. For me withdrawal is always severe anxiety. I can take other kinds of withdrawal but this kind when I feel butterflies with razor blades in my stomach I just want to die. Right now I go to a program so I don't have a community psychiatrist. Therefore I am not being prescribed benzodiazepine. So I suffer with anxiety that has no end. I stay in from 4 p.m. till 10 p.m. these days. I stop socializing because of the anxiety. Thank God at night I have some Seroquel to help me go to sleep. However I wake up 5 times during the night thankfully I'm able to go back to sleep. But I don't know what all this waking up is about. It must be a side effect. I'll be curious to see if the 112.5 dose helps me illuminate anxiety. Even if it does I don't plan to stay on it because all of the other horrible side effects how hard it is to get off of it it terrifies me. But my body has been through so much that if the 112.5 dose does making xiety go away. Then I'm tempted to stay on it just out of sheer exhaustion of feeling so much severe anxiety "

Anxiety is through the roof?","This is my first time on a therapeutic dose of an SSRI for this condition. I'm 26 days into my Lexapro (Escitalopram) journey at 10mg. I was on 5mg for 6 weeks before I decided to up my dosage. Before that I was on 10mg of Paroxetine, which was okay, but caused me unwanted side effects. Before that I was on 10mg of Citalopram for about 5 months or so, but felt it wasn't working well.  Anyway, I've been having mild anxiety since I switched a few weeks ago. I have had a couple of good days here and there, but I still haven't leveled out. Then, as soon as I was past the 3 week mark my anxiety took a turn for the worse. I started having mild anxiety which has progressively gotten worse to the point where last night I was tossing and turning, which felt like all night, my bodily sensations were that of panicky coldness which never manifested into full on panic, I was nauseous and pretty agitated. I considered a trip to the ER to get some reassurance, but decided to try to work through it. This is the worst I've felt in months. If I have to describe what I am going through today I'd say its very similar to the first time I took Paxil for panic. On Paxil after about 2 days my anxiety hits the roof and slowly subsides to the point where I feel normal again. My concern is that this ramp up of anxiety is happening so late in the game, day 26 at 10mg after 6 weeks of 5mg? Is this a normal reaction that I just need to ride out? Or is it reason for concern?

Stiff and Rigid Muscles, confusion, Very Overactive reflexes, Severe Tremors, unsteady, headaches, trouble concentrating, memory issues and Extreme Weakness. The Hand doc, reg doc and Neurologist took 4 MRI's and a multitude of nerve and blood tests and came back with no real answers besides a deficiency in B12 and D3... which didn't even explain all the symptoms. Needless to say i realize today that It could very well be a reaction to the drug and i need to stop taking it anyway. My question... Are any of the side effects long lasting? Will i get my strength back? Since i've already missed a week and a half am i almost through the worst of it? Thank you for your help. "

However, like the Zoloft, perhaps it will not be as helpful for anxiety. Just thought I would throw out the question in regard to Viibryd and help for anxiety, and perhaps also for people who also have tried Zoloft. Or maybe it just completely depends on each person's individual experience (which doesn't make getting back to good functioning easier). Thanks in advance. "

Specifically, I find that while not necessarily depressed my energy levels are decreased and I find too that I pretty much need 9-10 hours of sleep. When I first started taking Viibryd 3 years ago the only officially approved dose was 40mg. I had been taking 150 mg or brand Zoloft and still went into a depressive relapse. My Doctor had me titrate down from 150mg Zoloft to 100mg for 1 week, 50mg Zoloft the next week and 0 mg Zoloft for the 3rd week. Then he gave me a bunch of starter packs of Viibryd. I titrated up at 10 mg the first week to 20mg the second week. By the end of the second week I could already feels the effects of the Viibryd and the results were positive. This was the first time that I ever actually felt that my anti-depressant was working. I went ahead and went up to 30mg the 3rd week and after that I felt so good that I stayed there for about 5 weeks until I ran out of the starter packs. When I saw my Doctor to get a prescription he urged me to go to 40mg so I did. But it always bothered me a little bit that I was taking more than what in my gut I felt I needed. Anyway the first year at 40 mg was fine and even the second year was okay. But this last year I've felt sluggish (though not in a depressive sort of way). I know it is probably an insurance nightmare to ask my Doctor to prescribe 30 mg as it would involve prescribing both 20 mg and 10 mg tablets. But I believe that now that Viibryd has been approved as therapeutic at 20 mg up to 40 mg a 30 mg prescription is possible.  Meanwhile, I have been able to get clean and accurately splits of the 40 mg pill into quarters of 10mg each using a pill splitter. So my question pertains to the experience of others in going from 40 mg to 30 mg. And if not that, then from 40 mg to 20 mg and what that has been like for them. Thanks in advance. Sincerely, Rathmullan "

I have tried lots of medication and I am really worried nothing is going to work. I was originally on Cymbalta [before then I was on about 8 different medications over a 20 year time frame - I am 39 years old!}. Cymbals made me very tired.  I am also taking up to 5 mg of diazepam/valium a day only when needed which I feel like I need every day - but only take it if I am really really anxious. What should I do? I am seeing my psychiatrist in a week. I am worried if he wants me to increase the dose or should I ask if I should go back down? I am in a really bad state. I have an overseas holiday planned in 3 weeks and I am travelling with a friend and I am worried I will be in a bad state while I am there. He did say I could take up to 15mg of diazepam a day while I am travelling - to get through it but diazepam decreases my anxiety but slightly alleviates the depression.

Even worked at Yale where they develop the ketamine treatments for depression I have researched it so much and all the different clinics have different ideas of how to do the treatment it's very frustrating. And as you know extremely expensive. I would not bother with nasal or intramuscular due to the low improvement compared to Iv. I live in Monterey so Any centers within an hour to an hour and a half would be great. Or I might just go to Florida and try three day restorative treatment. Please chime in and let me know if you've had IV ketamine treatments or restorative ketamine IV treatments. Thanks!   I have had suicidal ideation depression for 35 years and I am treatment resistant and have acquired tardive dyskinesia Constant involuntary movement of my tongue and doesn't seem like it will go away . I have been on every medication imaginalable and combinations. I have been up-and-down and up-and-down so many times. I am told because of a target dyskinesia I cannot take any antipsychotics ever again which Zyprexa after 13 days always relieve suicidal ideation. (But then I crashed while on zyprexa )and possibly no other antidepressant medications again. I had ECT two different times. The first one 12 rounds lasted about two weeks to years later 28 treatments and all suicidal thoughts were gone for 10 years! Although I still battled depression and had to be on meds but it was a great 12 years compared to all the years before. I was able to go back to work part time, take care of my mom with Alzheimer's and have a boyfriend for 2 1/2 years! but I suffered severe memory loss and cognitive impairment the second time even though it worked great I would do it again but they told me with my memory loss it's not an option anymore. I recently did the rTMS at Stanford University but after four weeks I was not a responder so they stopped. Luckily there is a doctor here at Stanford doing research using theta burst TMS. Treatment lasted only five days. It worked for one week I was depression free! Usually last two weeks to three months and then have to do it again. So unfortunately I am back at Stanford doing it again and they want me to go to a ketamine clinic right after I finish this treatment until the open a ketamine clinic here at Stanford. Treatment at Stanford would only cost $30 a session for IV ketamine infusion compared to $1000 per session. I have no other options! I've been in and out of hospital several times, support groups for years which I highly recommend to people. Also, I would do rTMS before ECT OR IV KETAMINE. My insurances covered 100% of the TMS!

I,"... have dealt with major depression due to loosing my mother in 2007 and my father loosing contact with me. Well last night I was in the shower and I had a nervous break down crying and feeling really depressed, actually the last couple of months I have been depressed. And on top of it all I have been really irritable to my husband and we fight a lot, and I feel like being on Lexapro is making me worse not better. almost as if I don't need to be on this anymore and I don't want to be. I have gained tons of weight not happy worrying all the time so I decided to stop taking Lexapro last night. Well I decided not to take my pill this morning and this whole day I felt horrible major headaches, angry dizzy and all I wanted to do was sleep.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/lexapro-side-effects-subside-3254979.html,Will these Lexapro side effects subside?,"I experience major depression as well as high anxiety, I started Prozac 20mg a few months ago and it helped somewhat get me out of my funk over 5-6 weeks, but I never felt 100% and it gave me a lot of side effects. I talked to my doc and I switched to Lexapro 10mg. (In high school I had Lexapro 20mg that worked amazingly to help get rid of anxiety/depression). After stopping the Prozac I actually felt better, and the Lexapro 10mg really didn't seem give me any effects, either good or bad. I felt okay until about 3 weeks into the Lexapro 10mg I began to have returning feelings of depression/anxiety. We upped to 20mg, and so far I've been on it for 6 days. At first, I cried the first day and felt more depressed, but over the next couple days it eased a very little bit and I experienced pretty intense derealization and spaciness. Although that feeling has subsided a bit, I still feel a little spacey, very apathetic, neutral and pretty annoying memory problems/fog. I don't feel anxious or depressed, but I don't feel good or happy either. I don't like it because I can't experience any positive emotion, also I start graduate school in a month and I need my memory to be working 100%. Will these ""mental"" side effects gradually go away as I adjust to the medicine, or will I be stuck taking this to not have depression, but sacrifice all my positive feelings/memory, and never really feel like myself again? I could use some encouragement because I really don't want to go through trying another antidepressant. The first time I used Lexapro it literally saved me and I don't remember it making me feel so blah. Thank you. "

I'm not an anxious person and have never suffered from anxiety and depression before. However a couple of months ago while I was away I was hit with a sudden wave of derealization and depersonalisation. It is a horrible experience and makes me feel like I'm in a bubble and nothing is real. The whole world seems insignificant and irrelevant and my thoughts are racing in my head. Everything takes on a dream like state and I feel as if im going crazy. Simple things like crossing a road become difficult as I cant think properly and feel like Ive lost all control. Holding a conversation with a friend or anyone becomes impossible because everything seems pointless and like I'm losing my mind and no one can understand what I'm experiencing. Its a really terrifying experience and makes me feel really depressed and empty as it just gives me this feeling that life is pointless and what am I really doing here.  The waves of it came and went and really made being away difficult as I had no way of treating this or finding out what is causing it. The only possible conclusion I can come to is that its anxiety even though Im not atall an anxious person. I never experienced any childhood trauma or anything through my life that it may be a result of. It has gotten extremely bad the last few weeks and im finding that it is become increasingly debilitating as I'm unable to socialize with friends because I just go into this horrible bubble such as if I was in the pub with all my friends it hits me suddenly and makes me just want to go home and not leave my house, its also making me feel really down and depressed and all I can think about all the time is when it is going to happen. Sometimes looking in the mirror will really freak me out and just give me this horrible outlook on life.  I hate the thoughts of being on medication but if it was even just a case of having something to take just if it does hit really badly in a situation where I need my full awareness.  Does anybody have any experience with this and is there any treatments , like could CBT be beneficial? Thanks "

I've been on sertraline for over 7 years and was originally prescribed it for depression. Most recently I was down to taking just 25mg every 3/4days with no problems at all. 6 weeks ago I had a massive anxiety attack out of nowhere. I saw my gp who told me to go straight back up to 50mg a day which I tolerated for 2 weeks but anxiety and side effects were terrible. Saw gp again who suggested taking 25mg a day which again I could only take for 2 week. Then saw a different gp who told me to completely stop and try a different tablet. I tried for 2 days but was in bed with sickness/dizziness etc. I can't get an appointment till next week so have been taking 6.25mg of sertraline a day for last 5 days to help calm my anxiety. I'm still waking up anxious have nausea and wierd tingling in arms and head. Is this discontinuation or do i need to up the dose again? I really dont want to go through side effects again. After being on such a low dose can i just stop now? I'm really confused as what to do as my anxiety is better some days.

I didn't have a horrible hangover the next day & didn't get too drunk too fast, so I thought it was a success. However, ever since then I have been increasingly more depressed, worse than I was before I started the medicine. I'm emotionally eating again and even more hopeless. Needless to say I'm never drinking on this medicine again, but I'm just wondering if this has happened to anyone else and how LONG it will take for the medicine to start working again... if it even will. This has been my only gleam of hope in years and I'm afraid I screwed it up. "

I had my period on time and it was quick and light, only painful cramping one day. I am now on my second month. About 8 days into that pack, I started feeling a little anxious.

The next morning I woke up expecting to feel better. I actually felt worse. That awful anxious feeling was now accompanied by these terrible, negative thoughts about myself and my life that still, three days later I can not seem to control.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/bad-side-effects-dexilant-reglan-zoloft-709741.html,"Bad side effects - Dexilant, Reglan and Zoloft?","I had a cortisone shot a number of weeks ago that caused a plethora of side effects, including my hormones being completely screwed up. This set off anxiety for me, which I was doing ok with on Xanax as needed. Recently, however, the painkillers they gave me set off acid reflux. Typically, I can nip this in the bud by taking a Prilosec a day for a few days, no problem. This was worse than any spell I've had before. First I was on Nexium, which didn't seem to help; I was then put on Dexilant (60mg/daily) and Reglan (before meals and bed) for loss of appetite. This latest prescription was Friday. Saturday wasn't too bad, but Sunday was awful. Diarrhea, heart palpitations, anxiety that wasn't being touched by the Xanax, and eventually vomiting. Nausea has been preventing me from eating. Additionally, two weeks ago, the doctor put me on Zoloft - which I did not have a good history with (50mg/day). The last time this happened, I believe I began having suicidal thoughts, but she said this time might be different. I know a side effect of Zoloft is nausea and loss of appetite. Yesterday (Monday), I called the doctor and she agreed I should stop taking the Dexilant and Reglan (which was now causing me to shake). I'd only taken six Reglan between Friday and yesterday. My questions are: 1.) How long will it take for the Dexilant and its awful side effects (heart palpitations, hopelessness, anxiety, diarrhea, vomiting) to be out of my system? I've had one pill a day from Friday through yesterday. 2.) How long will it take for the Reglan and its side effects (similar to the Dexilant) to be out of my system? Six pills since Friday. 3.) How long will it take for the Zoloft to be out of my system? I've been taking 50mg once a day for just about two weeks, ending yesterday. I want to be able to go back to work, concentrate, and get my appetite/strength back. I was hoping this would resolve itself quickly, as I haven't been on any of this for too long.

I take 37.5 mg xr, and It helped pull me out of depression and anxiety and has gotten me on my feet, enough to be a teacher and have a job and get married. It helps to balance out my anger and impulsivity. I also do talk therapy and even Neurofeedback. But now I feel like it has crushed my creativity and true feelings (I am a sensitive artist type), and I've lost a part of myself in the process. I gained a ""life"" (my life was quite chaotic before the meds), but have lost a ""soul"" (maybe) I also take Aderol 10 mg XR to help me focus and get stuff done, for Adult ADD. My moods have always been a problem, and these two meds have gotten me through some tough times by cutting through my circles of though and focusing me on what needs to get done. But now I am trying to get off Effexor.  3 different psychiatrists have prescribed me 3 totally different ways to get off it, none of which have really worked. One was to give me Depakote, but that made me feel like I was on tranquelizers. Another gave me a tab of 37.5 mg effexor and told me to halve it to about 15 mg, and by the 4th day I felt like I was going down a black hole of depression. The first few days were really interesting, and I had my old creativity back, along with feelings. But then by the 3rd day my mood was jumping all the way up to all the way down. I was sensitive to light, sound, and any thought that passed through my head. I took everything as if it had to do with me, even TV shows. It drove me straight back to a full dose of 37.5 mg xr. Another doctor gave me Prozac to take at the same time, while taking beads out. Every time, I had to go back to my 37.5mg dose. What really gets me this past year was that I got awful Acid Reflux (GERD) and after cutting lots out of my diet, think it has to do with Effexor 37.5 mg XR. Does anyone else have this issue? Can it cause GERD?  These days I wait as long as I can in the day to take the Effexor, so that I don't get all woozy. That seems to happen after I take the pill. This really blows.

"Diabetes, Type 2",https://www.drugs.com/answers/metformin-unable-lose-weight-before-medication-571692.html,Metformin - unable to lose weight before medication?,"I see a lot of women who are happy with their weight loss results while on metformin, but I notice it is also in conjuction with a lifestyle change in diet and exercise. What I'd like to know is this: is there anyone out there (I know there must be) in their early 20's who, like me, has dieted their whole life and completely cut out sugar (other than a tbsp of honey with my chicory everyday), and exercised seriously since puberty and have still been unable to lose weight past a certain point (around 30 lbs overweight)? My health problems have been a complete mystery to me and all the doctors I've seen. They all just glance at my files and test results and say, ""Oh, you're healthy enough"" ""Excruciating cramps? That's normal."" ""You have a family history of hypothyroidism and ovarian cysts? That doesn't mean anything."" ""Low body temp? I'm sure it's fine."" ""Unable to lose weight? Are you sure you're not eating more than you realize?"" My endocrinologist won't even give me a complete hormone test. He says, ""There's no point in checking your testostorone. I mean, if it's too high, what are you gonna do? There's nothing you can do."" He and other doctors are ready to settle for an ""idiopathic diagnosis"" rather than perform tests that might confirm an actual one. So let me tell you my story and maybe you can share any ideas that you might have regarding what it is I suffer from, if anything other than hypocondria: when I was around 10, I ballooned in weight and ever since, it's been an uphill struggle just to stay within a 30 BMI range. In the last year, I've managed to lose 50 lbs (22 of which were gained on thyroid meds), but it's been so hard, and the weight has suddenly and stubbornly stopped coming off in spite of my hardest efforts to continue losing. I'm already on a low GI diet, the adrenal fatigue diet, the low-carb diet, the gluten-free diet, and Weight Watchers. Basically, all I allow myself to eat are vegetables, lean meats, certain dairy products, and water (lots and lots of water). As for exercise, I weight-lift, bellydance (and yes, I do feel silly doing it sometimes), and I do yoga. I used to do Denise Austin's ""Ultimate Fat-Blaster"" twice everyday but, after a year and no fat-blasting, I had to give up, because I had developed bone spurs and my shins, knees, and back were killing me from all the stress I was putting on my already heavy body. I used to suffer from excessive bleeding and clots during my periods but they have improved this past year. I also had excruciating cramps, sometimes when I wasn't even menstruating. However, my periods have been pretty regular and have gotten a little less painful this last year, so I'm thankful for that and hope that means I'm not infertile thought it's always been a deep, dark fear of mine. I have thin hair, brittle nails, and little red untreatable bumps all over my legs and arms as well as a few skin tags around my neck and underarms. Though I'm still looking for a doctor to perform the tests necessary to diagnose me, I suspect I suffer from insulin resistence and/or possibly PCOS. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but I just want a name to whatever it is I have. If anyone has an idea, I'd appreciate it. I honestly feel like reaching my ideal weight is impossible without a little extra help, either medication or liposuction. And I know there is no ""magic bullet"" for my problems. But what I'd like to know is if this medication might help since diet and exercise has failed? I know I'll always have to diet and exercise, but at this point, they are not helping my problems very much. If I am diagnosed with PCOS, I would still be wary of taking medication, especially after gaining weight on thryoid meds, but I'm getting very frustrated. Sorry to have written such a long description. I didn't mean to pontificate about myself, but I'm not sure what info will be helpful and what info won't. And I know I'm jumping the gun, researching PCOS meds when I'm not even sure I suffer from it, but I'm very eager to find a solution. Again, any advice or opinions will be greatly appreciated. I'll stop talking now. Thanks, Denise "
"Diabetes, Type 2",https://www.drugs.com/answers/lipitor-type-ii-diabetes-758047.html,Can Lipitor cause Type II Diabetes?,"Popular Statin Drug Lipitor causes Type II Diabetes in Women  ◦digg ◦ ◦ 5775EmailShare Some women taking Lipitor (atorvastatin) for high cholesterol problems developed type II diabetes, an unexpected side effect of the medication.   Lipitor Fails Users Who Trusted the Safety of the Drug   Sometimes, diet and exercise aren’t enough to reduce cholesterol levels for some women. The body simply fights all natural efforts to lower production, creating health risks such as atherosclerosis. As a result, doctors prescribe Lipitor, part of the family of hypolipidemic drugs. Lipitor inhibits the liver from producing an enzyme that increases LDLs (low density lipids) that are responsible for blocking arteries. In turn, the chances of having a heart attack or stroke from blockages are greatly reduced.   However, this life improving drug wound up causing more misery for a certain group of women who took it. It was found that peri- and post-menopausal women were at a higher risk of developing type II diabetes, even if they had no prior risk factors for the disease. The results of the studies first started showing up in 2010, 14 years after Lipitor became available. The side-effect of type II diabetes wasn’t solidly confirmed until the end of a seven-year study in 2012. That study showed women in the risk group are at a 50 percent higher chance of developing the disease than those who were not.   That means half of all women in the peri- and post-menopause group taking Lipitor are going to develop a life-altering condition that is almost irreversible.   The Signs That You may be Developing Type II Diabetes   There is no known reason why taking Lipitor causes diabetes. All that is understood is that Lipitor disrupts the metabolic function in the body for the risk group, allowing diabetes to take root.   If you are taking Lipitor, be aware of the following signs for diabetes:  ◦Vision is blurry, or beginning to blur  ◦Unexplainable weight gains or losses  ◦Symptoms of nausea, vomiting possible  ◦Constantly feeling tired or fatigued  ◦Appetite and thirst become excessive  ◦Increased instances of vaginal and yeast infections in women  ◦Sores or cuts that are slow to heal  ◦Mouth feels dry  ◦Skin itches, especially in the groin or vaginal region   Diabetes can also affect your breath to the point where it tastes sweet and smells like acetone/nail polish remover. Respiration may be rapid and deep, as if you are out of breath constantly.   If you are experiencing any of these symptoms while taking Lipitor, contact your physician immediately. "

I've never had kids, so the procedure was painful, but not the worst thing I've experienced (I'm definitely a wuss with pain). I've read a lot of horror stories about bleeding that doesn't stop and terrible side effects, but I'm hoping to have a positive experience.  I was previously on a generic of Yaz and it worked fine for regulating and shortening my periods by a lot. I didn't experience any negative side effects on the pill. I switched to Mirena to eliminate daily routines and periods altogether. Has anyone else also taken this route of action (from the Yaz to Mirena)?

When I go back to the doctor next month, I'm definitely going to try to have the strings shortened as much as possible so he won't feel them.

They then lowered my dose again to half pill which did not change my mood so that was good. After the trial ended they sent me to a nurse practitioner within the group who diagnosed me with Tardrive Dyskinesia, she decided to slowly get me off the Abilify and put me on Venlafaxine 150mg which is working for my depression.

A little back ground, I have had some previous skin problems in the past and been treated by freezing (cryo.) for a spot or two, one of which came back. I was born and raised in southern California and have the classic light, blonde and blue eyed make up. I also was raised in the day when sunscreen really wasn't heard of. I use to tan great and also had quite a few burns. One really bad burn one year across the whole right side of my face that blistered, turned black and cracked and bleed, this was about 30 years ago and I'm in my late 40's now, the time when things are starting to show. This Doctor is a relatively new Doctor to me and I am not fond of her for many reasons. You can't ask her anything. In order for me to get this medication I had to send an email through my patient portal to her nurse who relayed the message and who got back to me. This Doctor has refused and or conveniently forgets to give me a skin cancer screening that I have asked for several times and will not refer me to a Dermatologist. Because I realize that I am going to have skin problems due to my days in the sun and want to deal with the spots I have now, I researched my conditions/skin and possible treatments and researched these creams... because I asked through email this Doctor prescribed this cream for me. I don't think her instructions of using the cream for only seven days is going to do anything. I have applied the cream to my whole forehead, twice a day (not just the spots like suggested) I am planning on applying for two weeks, not the seven days. Not only have the previous visible spots on my forehead been reacting, but a bunch of other spots I didn't know I had are reacting too, so I'm glad I didn't listen to her.

Cough,https://www.drugs.com/answers/benzonatate-make-you-loopy-narcotic-cough-1747738.html,Does Benzonatate make you loopy like a narcotic cough medication or just sleepy like Benadryl?,"I've seen several reviews of people saying it made them really sleepy & one person used the word ""loopy"". I've finished a Z pack but still have a cough that keeps me up @ night, makes my chest, ribs, & back hurt, & even gets going so much that I gag. I have been through 2 bottles of Promethazine DM over the past 2 wks & it has not helped at all so my dr just prescribed this for me. I've never heard of/taken it before so I wanted to read about it first. For the most part it seems to help most people, if even for an hour or two. I have a 2 year old so I can't take something that's going to make me ""loopy"" like a narcotic. I have allergies & get sick every time the seasons change, often get Bronchitis or Pneumonia. So Ive taken Tussinex most my life, which contains hydrocodone. It works great for my cough, but now that I have a toddler that depends on me, I can't take something like that during the day that will make me loopy. So when I saw people posting that it made them sleepy or loopy I just want to know if its a loopy feeling like a narcotic or if its just a sleepy feeling like you can get from antihistamines like Benadryl. Thanks! "

This medication has greatly reduced the flow of my periods and has made them completely painless, the only problem has ever been the fact that I have never had a period while on the placebo. It always happens on the exact same day right in the middle of the hormone pills. My boyfriend and I became sexually active a few months after I started the pill when I began to realize that this menstral cycle pattern was staying. It stayed this way for the entire year until November 2013, my period skipped during the hormone pill, and finally happened during the placebo pills. I was happy thinking my body finally adjusted to the medication, but then in December I had my period twice- once randomly during the hormone pill, then again, mid-placebo, extending into the next hormone pack, and both of these periods were pretty heavy. And I have not had a period since, not in January, or Feburary. My placebo pills for March are 4 days away, but I thought I should go ahead and post about this because I am getting concerned. After missing the first period in January I decided to take a break from sexual activity with my boyfriend out of fear (still have been inactive since the ). I took a home pregnancy test 4 days after my placebo pills started in Feburary and it came out negative. I took another test one week later, still negative. My boyfriend keeps asking when we can become active again, but I'm too terrified since I haven't had a period in so long and I have no idea when it might come, or what I should do.

I immediately felt my lungs tighten up and was feeling pretty wound up (but not in a bad way-high energy, euphoric sort of, could still breath ok). I was sent home after a day and was told to take high doses of oral amiodarone. The 2nd night at home I woke at 1AM and felt like I couldn't breath. My lungs felt really tight air was going in but it felt like everything was inflamed, I had to concentrate on breathing. This lasted about 5 hours. The next day I went to ER and they found nothing wrong with me but I was feeling fine at that point. I kept getting these attacks, not all the time, every 3 days if nothing else. I stopped taking the amiodarone so maybe I was on it for 3 days in total, a high loading dose though. 3 weeks later I went to ER and asked to be put on prednisone which made me feel instantly better. 2-3 days later when the prednisone wore off I had the worse attack yet, it lasted for 8 hours all night long. These attacks felt like asthma, although, I never had asthma before. At that point I called my doctor and requested a steroid inhaler, which they gave me which got me through the next year. These attacks have gradually gotten better. At it's height I'd have splitting headaches, extreme dry eyes, a sore throat, slight hives on the neck, skipping heart beat, itchy skin and of course the breathing issues (high dose Advair made it so I felt like I could breathe through these attacks). And I'd have to defecate out of the blue right before an attack. I could cause myself to have an attack by working out or jogging, and 4 hours later the attack would start and last 8 hours. If I didn't work out it seemed like I'd get an attack within 3 days regardless. I heard this drug can have up to a 146 day half life. Things are a lot better now, I'll still get attacks but they are mild in comparison, taking aspirin helps if needed. Thanks! "

The Norco is 4 years old (I have it from when I had surgery on the other knee in 2012).  Since then (24 hours ago), I've basically been out of it and confined to bed. Very sleepy, lucid dreams, anxious. I assume this is because of the Norco/lorazepam interaction (I realize I should have started with perhaps half a tablet of Norco rather than taking 1.5 tablets). I have 2 questions: 1. At what point can I expect to feel reasonably ok again? (It's 24 hours since I took the Norco) 2. At what point is it safe to take lorazepam again?

I was put on this medication, after trying 2 others for my depression. It's been about a month since I've been off of it.. I don't think I had any symptoms right away besides night terror, which I still have. About a week and a half ago I started feeling nauseous and had headaches everyday, but not the whole day, a couple of hours (any time during the day). It wasn't until yesterday i actually vomited. Today I woke up from a night terror, and didn't feel the best, I laid back down to make myself feel better but still have a mild headache, or maybe more of a throb.  Is this from my venlafaxine???  There is other possibilities that could be making me feel like this, except I'm not pregnant... even though I have symptoms.  Also - I'm 21 years old, 20 when I was put on it. The drug kind of took my personality away, I actually feel better off of it.  I am now only taking Wellbutrin, that I was put on a few months ago, and birth control.

Depression,https://www.drugs.com/answers/wellbutrin-anyone-felt-worse-first-couple-weeks-3277231.html,Wellbutrin - has anyone taken it and felt worse for the first couple weeks?,"Hi. So this is my first time taking antidepressants. I have started them before but only was able to stick it out for a couple days before quitting. The side effects are very hard to handle. This time however I'm determined to stick it out and give it a fair shot, as my mild depression keeps coming back. My doctor first put me on Wellbutrin 150 XL, which is the extended release. I am very sensitive to medication and this dose felt very strong for me, hence me quitting after a couple days. So this time he put me on 75 mg not extended release. He said to start with this for 2-4 weeks so my body can adjust and then he said we will up the dose to 100mg or the 150 xl.  Its been 2 weeks I've been on the 75mg and even at the low dose I feel pretty bad. I feel more depressed and very irritable. Some days I just feel so agitated I can't even be around people. People say to stick it out and that it gets worse before better. The first week I had bad anxiety but that went away. However the depression and irritability is still bad. Has anyone experienced this? Did it get better? And if so how long before you started feeling better? And what dose were you on? I'm ready to give up but I'm already 2 weeks in so I really want to stick it out if there is hope of feeling better. Thanks for the responses ahead of time! "

At one point, I found myself curled up in my bed and all I could think about were the horrible things I saw when I worked as a Police Officer. Before anyone comments, no I’m not an officer anymore. So, I finally decided to call my psychiatrist. He advised I needed to up my dosage of lamictal by adding another half of a pill, this is 100mg each full pill. He then advised me to begin taking my Wellbutrin at the rate of three 100mg, three times a day, morning, after lunch, and then before bed. This totals 900mg a day in total. He said to do this until I can get into his office next week on Friday (7 days). I keep reading that for this dosage, I should call poison control or go to the hospital? Why would any doctor prescribe this knowing the risks? The only thing I can think of is that the lamictal is used to treat seizure disorders, so maybe he thought it would offset somehow?

I have recently decided to come off it after multiple discussions with a psych and mental health nurse. My GP recommended 10mg on day 1, 5mg on day 2, and then 0mg on day 3. Suffice it to say I got EXTREMELY sick on the second day. Headaches. Twitches. Extreme dizziness. Loss of coordination. Sweating. Dissociation. The whole list. I went back to my GP and they recommended: Go back to 15mg/d for 1 week, then 10mg/d week 2, 5mg/d week 3, and stop on week 4. I am now 4 days since stopping completely and all of the withdrawal symptoms have been back since after 24 hours of stopping. The biggest one is the dizziness. I can't drive, can't walk properly, don't have much coordination. The sweating, nausea, headaches etc are also present. To combat this the GP has recommended 0.5-1mg/d of lorazepam for 3 weeks, and taking 10mg of escitalopram every 2nd day if the symptoms continue to be bad after a few days on lorazepam. She said this should help with the dizziness and 'motion sickness'. However, online I can't really find any information on using lorazepam for this. I am quite nervous about trying it.

I just had a baby and developed mastitis (breastfeeding infection) so I still needed some antibiotics since I had to stop the penicillin. So I contacted my OB who -lucky for me- asked if the ER doctor put me on a tapered dosage. I told her 'no' and she was very surprised and told me to double check the instructions/bottle when I got home. I didn't give it much thought until the 10 days were almost up and I did some research to see why it's supposed to be tapered. When I saw what can happen from an abrupt stop I immediately called my OB back and she was shocked the ER dr prescribed it in this manner. She called in a prescription so it could be tapered. So, she had me do 30 mg for 2 day, then 20 mg for 2 days, 10 mg for 2 days and 5 mg for 2 days. When I went from the 60 mg to the 30 mg I had the most excruciating leg pain for about 48 hours. At some points I could not even walk or stand up at all. I have also been having fatigue and some joint pain in my wrists, ankles, knees, and fingers. In this short time I have deveIoped a moon face, lost five pounds and then gained it right back a few days later, also my abdomen is much larger. I finished the taper yesterday, so in total I took this drug for 17 days. I am wondering if anyone else thinks it is odd that the dr would prescribe 60mg daily for 10 days just for hives and then an abrupt stop without tapering it? Couldn't this have resulted in serious side effects? Also, was the leg pain (to the point of being unable to stand up) a withdrawal symptom or is this a sign of adrenal crisis? How do I know if my adrenal glands are functioning good or if they have been compromised by the medicine? Was this taper slow enough or should it have been done differently? Is there anything I need to be aware of after being on this, even though it was not long-term, it was such a high dosage that I am concerned about what effects it may have. Today is my first day not taking the medicine and I am fearful of adrenal crisis because of what I have read on it, but I don't know if I took it too short of time to be concerned. Sorry for so many questions. Just trying to get some general input on what people think about this situation. My legs are still hurting but they feel 100x better than what they did "

Update 2: so hes changed a lot and hes gotten a lot nicer and he treats everyone with respect and is kind but has his moments like we all do. and i dont know what it is, i just feel this block. when it comes to him i cant say i love you cause i feel disgusting saying it or i cant hug him cause its weird and i dont like being around him. i feel like i dont love him. hes nothing to me. i tolerate him. i am respectful,but sometimes he gets annoying and ill end up having a slight attitude but it happens right Update 3: so today i came home from school and im on my period and ive been really miserable lately. he came and pulled on my bag and idk why but it hurt and i just got pissed off and said stop it hurts and so he stopped and then started screaming at me and pointing at me and swearing and he got all in my face and said all i ever get from you is bitc-hyness and blah blah your dad doesnt give a fu*ck about you and ive been here your whole life and you cant even carry on with me as my mom just stood there.   Update 4: i do infact talk to him and i carry on with him sometimes. but i was never the person to say i love you to any one or give hugs or show affection. its just weird. im not like that and i do give him hugs sometimes and i do joke around with him so all of a sudden i snap because im in pain and he starts screaming at me and bringing in other people i love just to hurt me? grow up. i hate him honestly. i dont want to but i just do. i wish i had that perfect family. i dont know what to do, really.  i think the reason why is because i was scarred. ive told my mom that and she told me to get over it. and that its in the past. its not that easy, mom. i feel bad for not liking him because he does so much for me and i wish i could... but he just makes me so angry.

I’m taking sertraline 200mg, Wellbutrin 450mg for 4 weeks. it’s helpful to my depression to some extent, but the cure effect didn’t meet my expectations. In my case:I’m not very depress, I looks normal. I just low mood most of the time. like I can’t be happy, money can’t attracts me, I can’t enjoy the fun with friends, but the major problem is I lost the passion and ability to do my job. this makes me feel confused.

Now, I have two choices: 1:sertraline 200mg, Wellbutrin300 mg 2:Lexapro 20mg, Wellbutrin 300mg  Why Lexapro? because I have took this combination before, after 14days I said to my doctor I don’t think it’s helpful, nothing happened, and then my doctor changed my medicine. after few days, I felt good and it continued about a week, but it faded away in the end. I don’t know if this is Lexapro’s effect, so I’m thinking try it again. But now my question is : keep the present treatment for more weeks or make the second choice? I can’t make the decision. "

Depression,https://www.drugs.com/answers/taking-wellbutrin-lamotrigine-think-808668.html,Taking wellbutrin and lamotrigine. Not sure what to think?,"I started taking this combo about 2-2 1/2 months ago. I was going through a real low and it was hard to even deal with normal everyday stuff. The kind of feelings were you don't want to to move. I felt this way years ago but through pride and ego I didn't do anything to help myself out. I just managed through it and eventually felt ""normal"" again. And for a good few years I felt amazing. The potential I have in school, life, love and ect., really shined. But about a year ago that dark cloud came back and it felt that all of that potential vanished and I was just a hollow vessel. However, this time I sought help, encouraged by a friend that will never know it. Anyway, I was diagnosed with possible Bi-polar 2 and I was put I on these prescriptions. It wasn't overnight but change was happening at least a little. I feel different but I'm not sure how to describe it. However, with this combo I sometimes have some severe internal monologue happening. Sometimes it can seem debilitating and I still have a hard time focusing on things I know I should do. Though, this may not sound like it but it is a vast improvement compared to how I felt before. I guess my question is how has anyone reacted to this combo and what should I expect? Also, this sharing thing is quite new to me, I guess I am also curious on what course I should take and any other steps I can take towards improvement.  Thanks "
