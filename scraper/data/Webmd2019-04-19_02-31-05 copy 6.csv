Brain & Nervous System Disorders,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/27549/neurontin-gabapentin-and-cipro,Neurontin(Gabapentin) and Cipro,Probably had a reaction to Cipro after major spine operation. Tendom damage to right thumb are and left elbow which required surgery. Have a bad sinus infection that no Penicillin drug will help. Doctor putting me on Cipro(have to take the chance). Since Gabapentin is for nerve damage and neuropathy what is the danger of taking to two together. Would think that the Gabapentin would perhaps offset any nerve damage from the Cipro. My doctor did not even know that Cipro has a FDA warning. Doctors prescribing too many antibiotics over the years.,

Since that time she has continously been getting our kids to games & practices late. She still has hard time getting up in the morning. On several occasions I've brought kids down to her house at 7:00 in the morning, she new that we would be there, only to wake her up after ringing the door bell a couple of times. She still has a very volatile temper. Basically nothing has changed.  2 weeks ago my son & i were at my daughters game to be played waiting for my daughter & my ex-wife to show up. The game was suppose to start at 6:00. She came rolling in at 6:06. My daughter took off to sprint to the dugout so she could play. I ask her why she was late again & she said, once again, she lost track of time!   3 weeks ago when i dropped the kids off i noticed 2 books on her counter concerning anxiety. So she is showing signs of another comorbid condition. She was diagnosed with dyslexia when she was younger also. When my-ex wife hyper focuses she can do anything . She is brilliant!  Fast forward to this weekend. I ask her again to please get the kids to the games on time. She just acted like it was no big deal.  I've read Gina Pera's book; Is IT You ME or Adhd, been involved in several webinars, & accumulated 5 years worth of info. regarding adult women's Adhd. Feeling very sorry for her & her struggles i decided to give her the book & some other info. She really got angry with me! She then disclosed that she got diagnosed with Adhd awhile back. She wouldn't tell me how long ago. Though i think it was just recently. She also said that her 67 year old father just was recently diagnosed also. I pray for the kids sake that her condition improves through medication & Adhd coaching like so many of the success stories I've read over the last few years.   The whole point behind this post today is for you spouses out there & close family members to not give up on helping your loved one. If you've done the research & talked with Good Credible Adhd Doctors about your loved one & you suspect they have Adhd they more than likely do. For you folks out there that can relate to what i'm discussing, you no what to do. Until you lived with someone with Adhd there is no way you can comprehend the daily roller coaster ride that one is on! Get them some help!!",

He had non-affected parents and 8 siblings, his condition was tentatively attributed to a heavy head trauma with brain contusion 14 years prior to the illness, and possibly lifetime diesel exhaust exposure (there was a study about truck drivers more suspectible to SALS). In August 2015, I started to feel a heaviness/subclinical weakness in my left arm and hand, which was worse in cold weather, but mostly gone into remission by now. Shortly after that, I started experiencing bodywide fasciculations, for which I had exams in September 2015. The neurological exam was unremarkable, the EMG found no abnormality in the left opponens pollicis, abductor digiti minimi and tibialis anterior. I also had negative SOD1 and C9orf72 tests. The fasciculations waxed and waned, slightly controlled by Carbamazepine and Diazepam, but somewhat worsened in the last few months, which I attributed to work-related stress. I have a hot spot over my left eyebrow which has been twitching almost non-stop for 2 years. Sometimes when I twitch, I experience an electric-shock like sensation going down the side of my neck. I have high arches (inherited from my mother) and I also experienced mild sensory symptoms, essential tremor, joint cracking, migrating back pain (scoliosis/sitting for long in an abnormal posture?) a spontaneously resolving right abducens palsy, and moderate trigeminal neuralgia-like episodes (every 3-4 months, moves from one side of the jaw to the other). Cramps were rare (once every 3-4 weeks), nightly and always happened in the calves. Prior to the onset of my disease, I had (mostly morning) nausea and vomiting for 3-4 years, which resolved appr. when the other symptoms started. I also had (and has) proctalgia fugax for years. My cervical MRI in 2015 was unremarkable (scoliosis), my cranial MRI in 2016 showed a DVA and a non specific periventricular occipital T2 lesion. In December 2016 I had a NCS, which found a mild carpal tunnel in my right hand and mild generalized temporal dispersion suggestive of demyelination. I had a clean immune test, incl. anti-GM1. In July 2017 I had a 2 week episode of left shoulder stiffness, which was found to be not spastic in a neuro exam. I also had a 2 day neck stiffness shortly after that, which I attributed to my lifestyle and work. In the last few weeks, I started to feel bilateral knee stiffness/""wobbling""/""jelly-like feeling"" (worse in the left side), which causes tremor when standing up after sitting for long. However, I was still able to hike 10+ miles in an difficult terrain even though I'm not athletic. What's more, my legs felt somewhat better after that. A follow-up EMG in this September picked up the following abnormalities, which is summarized by the EMG neurologist as ""minor abnormalities of uncertain etiology"" Mild amplitude reduction and temporal dispersion (worse than in 2016) in the left peroneus with decreased F-Wave persistence. Increased insertional activity, CRDs when moving the needle or percussion, fibs and psw in certain needle positions in the left tibialis anterior. Mild subacute neur. lesion. Incr. ins. activity, fibs when moving the needle, no spontaneous activity at rest. mild polyph. MUP in the left deltoid. This muscle was considered normal (?) in the summary Incr. ins. activity, fasciculations, fibs in multiple needle positions, active partial denervation in the left frontalis. Aplitude increase, fibs and fasciculations in some needle positions in the right longissimus thoracic. Subacute neur. lesion. Interference pattern/recruitment were otherwise normal. My questions/concerns about this EMG are the following: My understanding is that cranial and paraspinal denervation are highly specific for ALS. In that sense, and given the other findings, how valid are the ""minor"" and ""unspecific"" terms in the EMG summary My understanding from the poly MUP in my arm EMG that it's indicative of reinnervation. Is it possible in ALS to practically regain all strength for months in a muscle? Do the non-MND symptoms point to something or are they appear to be incidental findings? I strongly lean toward PMA/LMN-dominant ALS, but the onset of my symptoms, the lack of clinical weaknes, no athrophy (I have a dent in my right gluteus, but my neuro said it was pressure lipoathrophy, and I believe her), improvement in my arm and other symptoms seem very strange...",

ADD/ADHD,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/52165/the-connection-between-add-and-sleep-apnea,The connection between ADD and sleep apnea,"A search on WebMD for ""connection between ADD and sleep apnea"" produced no results. There were separate results for ADD and sleep apnea, but none for a relationship between the two. That's why I shared my story on Facebook, at    Short version: 20 years after my diagnosis with ADD (at age 49), I was diagnosed with sleep apnea. One month after using a CPAP machine, I no longer needed any medicine. The medication helped the symptoms, but cured nothing. The CPAP machine was a CURE.  ADD/ADHD has no single known cause, and (as such) has no ""cure."" Its presence is established only by its collection of symptoms. (There are many drugs that ease thew symptoms, all with side effects.) The symptoms of sleep apnea are virtually identical to those of ADD, and IT HAS a cure. My strongest recommendation: if you suspect you have, or are diagnosed with, ADD or ADHD, Get Tested For Sleep Apnea. If that's what you have, skip the expense and side effects of all those drugs. (As a veteran, I get the machine and all supplies for it for free.) Sleep Apnea is not just about snoring (although a CPAP machine puts a stop to snoring). It's about cumulative physical and mental damage. When your airway is obstructed by excessive tissue in the throat, a cycle repeats of 1)cessation of breathing, 2) buildup of CO2 in the lungs, 3) an autonomic response of a release of adrenaline, which wakes you up enough to get you to roll on one side, allowing breathing to resume, but not enough to bring you to full consciousness. This cycle typically repeats a hundred times a night. Your mind suffers from lowered oxygen levels and low-quality, non-restorative sleep. Not only do you wake up tired, your mental functions suffer all day.  In addition, those 100 shots of adrenaline every night have cumulative negative effects on both body and mind. Questions I can't answer: do ALL people ""who have ADD/ADHD"" actually suffer from undiagnosed sleep apnea instead? Does ADD, as some claim, not exist? Have there been any studies connecting ""ADD"" and sleep apnea? (I have found nothing hitting this target. If you have, please respond.) Questions I CAN answer: are medical professionals aware of the overlap of symptoms? (In my experience, no.) is Big Pharma motivated to find cures, rather than medicines to mask symptoms? (NO.) Will most people in authority avoid addressing this issue? (Yes.) Are healthcare and other professionals in contact with the affected population surprised when informed of the overlap in symptoms between ADD and sleep apnea? Always.  Can I make a difference? Maybe. Likely not through official channels, but directly to the public. Most of us are affected, directly or indirectly, by this pandemic. I'm trying to arrange a TED talk on the subject.","ADHD in Children , Symptoms , Treatment & Care , Diagnosis , ADHD in Adults"

Anyways, for over a year I have done HORRIBLE in school, failed pretty much every single class. It's gotten to the point where I got kicked out of the program I was in.. I decided to take a term off and then go back in a couple months, try and figure out med for ADHD and then start back up in school. Though since I've been back I noticed how tired and how old my parents are getting and they don't want to retire until my siblings and I are though school.. So I was thinking of scholarships and then I saw a class and I really want to do it but I'm honestly so scared of failing again and it's such a drain on money...  Idk what exactly I'm looking for but I need some one who understands.. I can't tell if it's ADHD or other things or maybe I'm just lazy and not motivated enough.. what do I do?","Living With , Symptoms , Treatment & Care , ADHD in Adults"

ADD/ADHD,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/42144/confused-stressed-worried-about-add,Confused stressed worried about ADD,"Hello everybody, it's nice to meet everyone. I was told by my GP I was ""highly likely"" to have ADHD(focusing more on the inattentive, some but few hyperactivity) as a young adult. I just don't know about this whole process and everything.. I started taking ritalin 10mgx3 a day, which seems to be the standard starting medication. It worked for an hour but would wear off, and after telling my GP he gave me a generic of concerta, and concerta generics have a history of not working after doing my research, and this one felt like I was taking nothing overall. After 2 weeks of that I took some of my leftover ritalin pills and today was the first time it didnt really work. Is it possible my GP made a mistake in his diagnosis, maybe I dont have ADHD? Is he testing me to see if I truly have it by giving me these kinds of medications? Is it normal for it to take multiple tries to find the right medication? Do I need to employ other methods on top of the medication so I can actually focus and study for once in my life? Can my doctor prescribe me medication even if I dont have it? I feel like I dont even know what is normal anymore, everyone says they have ADHD cause they hate their prof and cant focus during lectures, what if thats me? But I also scored high on my doctors ADHD test and other online adhd tests, and everytime I watch a ADHD video for the most part I feel like they literally describing all my tendencies and I could really really relate to them which was what prompted me to talk to my GP about this.

I tend to search every crevice for an answer, most have been found.As of late, I’ve learned the meaning of helpless. My son has changed, everyday I see it. I cant fix it & I feel like I’m losing him. Last year we moved from the only place he called home to Waynesboro pa. A few months later,after dealing with passing sadness & waves of home sick crashing around us, my son began having these episodes that are best described as an autistic type meltdown. They are brought on by stressors such as frustration, or me asking him to do something he wasn't prepared to do,like me saying, “peyt bedtime, “ or his most frequent stressor from the past was accidently breaking his mouse from his fidgeting(causes worst meltdown). I can usually tell when his control is slipping or if it is going to be a troubled day. In the past, when these stressors happened the change was gradual & he could sometimes calm down if left alone. Now, he snaps first into a rage of bashing his desk, forcing his chair arm, squeezing a remote till it cracks, his strength is intensified & with it the rage, I must move him from the initial area to his bed, soft things wont cause pain. With this comes the headache, extreme sound and light sensitivity, repeating words to himself, stimming, unable to communicate in sentence form, unable to move his legs to walk or stand (brain appears stuck in a loop). When I tell him to move to the bed he doesn’t hear, he repeats loudly as if responding to the initial stressor. When finally he hears and he tries to comply, he can’t make his body move, his brain seems stuck. He tries harder to get up from his chair and his legs start to move & kick like running. Then he rocks in a hunched position and repeats,”wait, waaaaaaaait, just wait. “ He never gets his legs to move functionally but he gets to the bed, with prodding I get him to drink his chamomile tea & he begins to calm. His calm down always ends in tears, sadness of past life events and crying. He has no memory of these episodes. If he is slipping into one he cannot focus on any task & he retains no information. For instance, Peyt very much enjoys editing videos & was working on a project close to bedtime when I said, “hey lil guy almost bed time, “ he snapped into the beginnings of an episode. He repeated no no no no no & rocked. Then hes unresponsive to my words, as if he cant hear them, however during these times sound & light disturbs him to extremes. His hearing turns extraordinary & he repeats""why are you shouting, why are you shouting,"" when it was but a whisper of words I spoke.He s unable to feel normal for days after. This began last year. His anxiety has been crippling this week, any mentions of outside or future plans & he starts to slip away. He also gets headaches, cold sweats, hot chills and his vision has worsened.  When Peyton began school I took quick notice of him being 8-12in taller than every child. At 13 hes now 5.9, with a deep voice, facial & other hair (found grey hair on is scalp)also his head is almost an inch in circumference larger than the adult male standard(I hadn't noticed at the time of appointment, so it wasnt mentioned to the endocrine) This year he was tested for gigantism, I was told his hand xray revealed he was in the growth stage of a 17 year old.  From around age 7 change was an issue, but he was able to cope within a day. Once I bought him a gaming chair he had been asking for, he cried over the old one, saying he can't take it, he can't take it. We got a kitten and he cried, muttering words of, ""it's too different, I can't keep it,"" all the while he hugged and nuzzled its little furry body. I also had to advance warn/remind him of any arrangements, in countdown form, from a week away to a few days to a few hours to a few minutes. If we were going to the movies with mom-mom, I would do the usual countdown, Peyt, we’re going to the movies in 2 days, 1 day, 1hr, 30mins, 15mins... This made things easier, except for nights before, and always at bedtime, when his anxiety of what is to come upon his waking, looms over him like a blanket of dread. On such nights even if it is something that I must do & in no way involves him, the questions begin, "" how long will it take, are you sure it's just the movies, when will we/you be back, what if I can't fall asleep(but for holidays, he has never had a problem sleeping), "" &t it continues from 30mins to hours. He also had a mild ocd (turning, checking door knob & unable to not touch curious things, like smudges in the toilet bowl) he overcame parts of it quickly. Now 13 he touches things, especially in stores, just last month he asked ""mom, can you please not leave a pan soaking? I have to touch it &I know I don't want to.”  Any ideas, hunches, experiences, I’ll take them. I need direction. I had lymes and Im still symptomatic. Today, I thought, maybe a tick borne disease could be a cause of his new behaviors? He has Keystone central chip&has seen his pcp who referred him to an endocrine for possible acromegaly(told he is normal) and psychiatrist(im afraid will only treat symptoms &miss an underlying cause that may be apparent to others). I have no strength left, this week has taken all of me. I am just a mom whose only want is for her littleguy to be okay. He was okay & now he’s not & I don’t know how to help him. I don’t know who to ask or where to go to find him help. Katrina",Caregiving

Brain & Nervous System Disorders,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/22742/long-term-beta-blocker-for-facial-blushing,Long term beta blocker for facial blushing,"Hello,  I have for many years had great success in reducing facial blushing, using a beta blocker. I have used Atenolol and Propranolol, which both have worked. The problem is that they only work for about 4-5 hours, and I need it to work for a whole day (around 18 hours).  This brings me to my question: Which beta blocker do you recommend for my problem, that fits the duration criteria? I would really appreciate it if I could get a list of several different brands.  From what I have read it is very common to use Propranolol and Atenolol for blushing (and other anxiety symptoms, like shaking, trembling of the voice, etc.). Other beta blockers are rarely mentioned, even though there are many beta blockers with a much greater half-life. Is there any difference between the beta blockers, other than the half life? If there is, I would like to know which ones you think is best suited for my problem. What’s more, to reduce the amount of side effects. I only need it to stop the blushing (calm down the «fight and flight mechanism» of the nervous system), and I don’t take it for heart reasons or anything like that. The more a beta blocker is «interacting with several different aspects of the body», of course the greater the side effects. So, the less the beta blocker works on the body, other than what I am taking it for, the better.  Summation: •	Which beta blockers work for at least 18 hours, and can be taken every day?  •	Which beta blockers do you recommend, when you also take in to account minimizing the side effects?  Thank you for taking the time to respond to this! I really hope I get a good answer from this, as that would greatly improve the quality of my life.",

My wife said she was having terrible migraines that started 4 1/2 years earlier, she went to a neurologists to run numerous tests to determine causes for her severe migraines. CAT scans, MRI's X-rays, blood tests but nothing conclusive. My wife and I looked into Dementia because she was having various other symptoms associated with it. She was also have vison issues which we later corrected for the most part. He memory was going and she was getting confused very easily anymore. She used to be an Air traffic controller in the navy and later a long haul trucker, jobs that required a lot of thinking and planning. She could no longer do that anymore. We went to internet to describe symptoms she was having and thought we could help. The first Doctor just dismissed our research and kept pumping her with various drugs and families of drugs until they exhausted their course of medications and treatments and then started to repeat them again. Wasting more time. We finally went to a few more doctors (Pain specialists and Neurologist's) but they basically did the same thing and this time we brought up the possibility of Dementia or Alzheimer’s. We were dismissed of that Idea because they all said she was too young. Age 54 at the time. After about 2 years we finally went to another Neurologist's, a female doctor this time and had more tests done and expressed out concerns about Dementia. This doctor finally looked into it and did several quick tests and determined my wife did have Alzheimer’s. Why are doctors so quick to dismiss this disease? Especially when she had almost every symptom. It seems that checking for the disease early is just a waste of time if doctors are going to dismiss the patient and their symptoms because they thing the patient is too young to have this disease.",

I'm at my wits end! I don't know what to do, I'm only a 19 year old female. Any advice or comments, suggestions, inferences or hypotheses as to what could possibly be going on with me would greatly appreciated. (writing this with shaky hands), here's a little in sight of what's been going on/ when it started and the symptoms i've been experiencing. I've wrote down the dates from day 1 to present (which might be a little off) *Prior to the first date i've listed below, I was experiencing other symptoms over the course of a month but gradually. Fatigue, feeling like I was in a fog most of the time, trouble remembering things, concentrating, just didn't feel all there. I noticed my right eye felt as if it wasn't as strong as my right one (blurriness). My right ear also felt plugged all the time followed by a pain on the right side of my face that was connected from my ear to my jaw that lasted a little more than a month but has now subsided. Things such as clumsiness, tingling in my hands and feet and weakness were also experienced. *May 27th 2017* Was when I first went to the ER for an excruciating headache, I was given an IV + headache medication, I felt this feeling of general discomfort throughout my body as the medication was going through the IV to my arm (have not felt the same since, it was like an irritable feeling that I still sometimes experience.) A few days after that I began to feel very shaky and just not okay. Was still having problems with my right eye, was also continuing to suffer from the intense headache listed above but it was now causing a burning sensation in different areas of my head and the back of my neck. This headache and feeling of pressure/ burning sensations continued on for about a week or so.  *June 3rd* was STILL experiencing this same headache/pressure and burning sensation, so I went back to the ER. After waiting for 4hrs+ at the ER just to see the doctor, he examined me and didn’t think anything too serious of the headache suggesting a possible sinus infection. I told him I didn’t think it was just a sinus infection after mentioning a history of brain tumour in my family, I asked for a CT scan of my head just to make sure. Hesitant to give me the CT scan because of his doubt that there was anything seriously wrong (such as a brain tumor) he prescribed me sinus infection medication and sent me on my way. *June 7th Went back to the ER with the same severe persistent headache and burning sensations throughout my head and neck along with a few new symptoms that presented themselves such as weakness as well as a burning sensation on the top of my legs. I was seen by a different doctor this time, who thought a CT scan was in my best interest. I agreed to the CT scan of the brain which came back as in fact sinus inflammation in the brain. I was given RAN- CLARITHROMYCIN 500MG & PMS-DEXAMETHASONE 4 MG. Although a sinus infection was the only thing to come of the CT scan, the symptoms I had been experiencing and explained to the doctor earlier ex. burning in my neck and head, trouble with my right eye, intense migraines, clumsiness, cognitive issues (poor memory, unable to concentrate) ""brain fog"", muscle weakness, suggested him to believe it could be something more, he mentioned a possibility of MS and told me he was going to order an MRI of my brain to rule it out.  *After taking the medication for the sinus infection the headaches did stop*. From June 7th - 16th awaiting the MRI of my brain the doctor from the ER had ordered I was very stressed and depressed about thinking MS was what was causing all these symptoms. I was under extreme amounts of stress. At this time I started noticing the fatigue becoming worse where I would just have to lay down due to feeling very weak and physically exhausted. Also at this time I noticed I was having sleep troubles. I would have a hard time falling asleep even to just nap even though my body was so tired, my brain would just not allow me to sleep. At night time especially I would also have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep as I would wake up every couple hours. I also noticed I'd developed a slight tremor in my right hand/arm whenever I would lay down. The tremor was not as noticeable to the naked eye as it was within my body, it would keep me awake as well due to just being uncomfortable. Within the next two weeks of experiencing these symptoms I also noticed a decrease in my weight. I lost a total of 14 pounds unintentionally, but possibly due to extreme stress.  *June 17th I had the MRI of my head. The tremor in my hand/arm got slightly worse as you could now see a slight shake with the naked eye, I also noticed my legs would twitch while laying down and feel as if they had a slight vibration to them coming from the inside. *June 19th exhausted from only getting maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night accompanied by the weakness in my body and tremor, I also noticed an irritable feeling in my upper back from time to time making it very uncomfortable to lay down or to sit for long periods. It felt almost as if I had restless back syndrome that persisted throughout the day and the night. Sometimes this feeling would go into my arms, as well as the burning sensations on the top of my legs continuing to persist. *June 22 Was my appointment with the neurologist to discuss my prior MRI scan of my brain to see if MS was the reason behind these symptoms or not. I and was told by the neurologist my brain scan was clear having no lesions, and that MS was ruled out. After explaining to the neurologist my still existing symptoms they did a physical neurological exam confirming it was still not MS. They then suggested an anti anxiety medication. I had an appointment with my family doctor that following day, and explained the persisting symptoms I was still having. My doctor also related it back to anxiety and prescribed me with an antidepressant/anti anxiety medication which I have not taken because I do not agree that these symptoms are from anxiety. As well as ordering more blood work, checking levels, deficiencies and ruling out any other scary things such as Lymes, Lupus, RA, & crohn's disease. *All blood work has came back normal, and negative for any autoimmune/rheumatic diseases*.  A few weeks later with still no answers and the same persisting symptoms, along with some new ones that are becoming quite concerning. I’m now experiencing widespread pain throughout my body. These pains come and go hitting my body in different areas giving me extreme muscle pain mainly in my back, forearms, shoulders, hips, knees and buttocks. The pain intensifies in different areas, the other day I woke up with my upper back aching for hours and then it would move down to my lower back. Then the next day my back wouldn't hurt any more but my left forearm would be in excruciating muscle pain as if I'd just exercised heavily the day before (which I did not). Other extremities such as my ankles, hands, feet, toes and fingers would just ache,pain and almost feel like little electric shocks(mainly in fingers and toes), throughout the day accompanied by the burning sensation. I am still not able to fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night. I’ve woken up overheating and sweating, not being able to swallow. A rash that appeared out of nowhere on my neck (went away after an hour) along with a very flushed face. Restless back and leg pain (in the day and at night). At this point I just don’t know what to do!! I’m out of answers, very frustrated and in pain :( Could this be a neurological problem? brain damage? fibromyalgia? I don't know :( if anyone has anything similar experiences that followed by a diagnoses or any idea of what this may be let me know!!","Epilepsy/Seizures , Parkinson's Disease , Alzheimer's Disease , Caregiving"

Since then, he has not had any serious incidents. He doesn’t think it’s arthritis, but some nervous system disorder. He has been to doctors who have prescribed him Ambien, Neurontin, and a few other generics, but he says those drugs have not helped him very well.

He had a tough childhood with a father who he suspects has ADHD too but was never treated. I am guessing his childhood and his experiences as an adult with ADHD have made him cold emotionally. When he is in one of his moods he his very nasty and mean to others and myself. I have learned to be patient but I have snapped and given him a piece of my mind. At this point I am unconcerned about his moodiness because I would gladly deal with it forever exchange for a few loving words.,"Living With , ADHD in Adults"

Bear with me its been a long & difficult road the past several years. Met my ex. back in 2005. Hit if off right off the bat. She was previously divorced a year before. We married in 2007. Shortly after our marriage i started noticing odd behaviors. My ex. had difficult time getting to sleep at night, really hard time getting up in the mornings to the point that she would be physically awake but would not be consciously awake for 15 - 20 min. She would be hostile to me even if i tried talking to her shortly after waking.   She has many of the Adhd symptoms in adult women. Places money just anywhere in the house, inside several drawers, on several tables & just about everywhere you could imagine. She would place empty cigarette cartons in lots of different cloths drawers also. My ex. would be in the shower for 45 min. to a hour & not even realize it when i mentioned it to her. Back then we could hardly ever get to a app. , family event on time unless i kept nagging her to get it in gear. She never would fill out any school forms for the kids. She would not ever get involved in our finances. I ask numerous times to let me show her ours bills & where we were at financially & she just showed no interest at all. I would have our two kids ready to go & we would be waiting on her. She would very seldom do any house cleaning. Our home was a mess if i didn't clean it.  Our children came in 08 & 09 a boy & a girl. What a blessing in our lives they are. My ex seemed to really focus on our children the first few years but all of a sudden she just seemed like she couldn't handle the daily grind of working & helping raise our kids. Got to the point when kids were in first grade & pre-k i would have to come home & make sure she had the kids up & ready to get to school in time. Several times the kids would be up & playing & she was still asleep when i arrived. Keep in mind the kids were 5 & 6 at the time. Discussed this with her & she seemed like it was no big deal.  As years progressed her condition seemed to worsen. Just seemed like i was taking care of 3 kids. As i look back this is where the Parent Child Syndrome kicked in. Our marriage started failing around this time. I knew there was something wrong but just couldn't figure it out. I wanted to be the perfect husband & not complain about what was going on .  We kept on growing apart. She just seemed to want to party all the time with not much responsibility towards our kids. Anything that was monotonous or boring she didn't seem to want to have any part of.   In the fall of 2014 she ask for a separation. I was floored but not all that surprised. She told me she wanted to have fun & was not going to live her life based on my schedule. I went to counseling by myself a couple of times first. I talked her into going & she went. I later returned to counselor for third session & the counselor said i wasn't the problem in the marriage. We then had a few joint meetings between me my ex. & counselor. Don't know what was said between my ex. & counselor . My ex. would never tell me. We got along a little better for a couple of months then she called me requesting a divorce in spring of 2015.   I then really started searching for answers to problems in our relationship. Searched the internet & our marital issues seemed to trace back to Adhd. My ex- told me when she was young her mom would tie her up in chairs sometimes to keep her still. Her father showed a lot of the same traits my ex does. She also told me that her grand mother had psychological issues being placed in straight jackets on a few occasions. She explained this to me earlier in our relationship. So when i subtly brought up her symptoms to her she stilled blamed me for our demise.  We ended up getting divorced Dec. of 2015. We have joint 50/50 custody of our children. Its been a hard road . My daughter cries each time we make the transfer on weekends. My son tends to keep his feelings inside. My ex wont get the kids to practices on time, has never showed up to my sons basketball games on time etc. Now just the other day my son ask me if i could pick him up from after school day care before his basketball game. I ask him why because its moms night to pick you up. He said that if i picked him up he wont have to worry about him being late & not running out on floor the same time as the other kids. Come to find out from him that is what happened the previous game.   What, or is there anything i could do or any way help our situation at this point? Oh, by the way our son was diagnosed with Add 1 1/2 years ago & my ex- is still in denial.",

(I thought more ADD rather than ADHD because she just couldn't focus on school.) Seemed like every time we went to the doctor she was increasing her Adderal dose. In August the increase bumped her up to 30mg. Not cool!! I found out that she was self harming and had a plan to commit suicide. In October she told me she didn't like the way they were making her feel and refused to take them. I contacted the doctor and she finally was able to see us in November. Which she had been off the meds for almost a month. During that time I got my baby back...spunkiness, laughing, enjoying life, caring and thoughtful...something I hadn't seen in awhile. Anyways, at the doctors visit (a month later) the doctor was asking about her episodes. At which time, my daughter said she doesn't feel that way anymore...we had to go to the er for a mental evaluation. Ok whatever, it's protocal. The case worker said it sounded like the meds triggered her into a bipolar depression state and require behavioral therapy. So we are doing that. In the meantime I am enjoying my daughter again. She said she feels normal BUT her grades are struggling just like before. (from A-B Honor Roll to failing 2 classes) The reason to be put on the meds...to focus better in school. I have also noticed recently she is binge eating. I guess after saying all of that; my daughter needs something to help her focus more and binge eating less.

Some time last year one night I woke up with bad cramp in my leg, the next day my leg and foot felt funny but thought nothing of it as thought it was the after effects of the cramp. Over the coming days/weeks it seemed to get worse, I started falling over, finding it difficult putting shoes and socks on. I didn't pay much attention at first so took a while to realise something wasn't quite right. After a bit I became much more aware of it, I found I couldn't lift my left foot up and was dragging my foot etc. I try to avoid going to Drs so I left it a while hoping it would get better on its own. After a month or 2 I went to Drs, they took blood tests and I was diagnosed with food drop however they couldn't at this point determine the cause. I was referred to hospital for physio however, by the time I got an appointment I noticed it started to slowly get better. Over the weeks gradually I could lift my foot bit by bit. Now, the foot drop has completely gone but I seem to have been left with after effects. Mostly when I am in bed at night, my left lower leg, foot and ankle just doesn't feel right...its hard to describe but feel a bit like numbness / pins and needles. The best way I can describe it is, wrap a band around your finger to cut off the blood supply and you finger will feel of, it's like that.  It's hard getting comfortable in bed, find it easier to slightly dangle my leg over the side of my bed as the least pressure on my leg the more comfy it is. Anyway, sorry if that makes no sense but hoping someone will know if this feeling in my leg will ever go?",

For the past year or so, I have been experiencing episodes of distorted sense of smell. It happens randomly, after certain triggers. It is EXTREMELY difficult for me to describe. One moment, all is well. Then suddenly, a strange smell appears out of nowhere and stays, and all other smells, although detected, but become extremely distorted (usually pungent) e.g. a deodorant/perfume smell would feel much stronger than it really is and a bit different or pungent. This happens in both nostrils and in different frequencies, sometimes everyday, sometimes every other day, sometimes 2-3 times a week and so on. Triggers: Sharp inhale/exhale  Laughing  Sneezing Sometimes, I can feel that it is about to happen. Relieving factors: Only sleep. Otherwise, it stays even the whole day once it begins. But things become normal after I wake up. Then, a sneeze or other trigger can bring it back again for the entire day till I sleep again. Indeed, when it happens, I feel somewhat sleepy or else lose desire to do other things. There are no other symptoms and I do not have any known medical conditions (thankfully). I am also not on any drugs. No one in my family has such symptoms. Is it bothering me? Certainly yes. For one thing, food loses all its delicacy because of the weird smells. Secondly, it makes me annoyed and not want to do anything till it goes away. Other info: I do have a DNS, but I am unsure if this seems to have anything to do with it. The problem seems to be higher up, in my opinion. I also have an occasional complaint of eye flashes.",

It started because I had very poor posture when sitting at the computer hunched over for long periods of time. When the pain first occurred, it was so severe that I stayed up all night screaming. The day prior I felt a little soreness in my shoulder, but when the pain came full force I could not even sleep. I never went to the hospital at the time, which I probably should have. The pain lasted for a few days and then I woke up the following morning with a winged scapula. My shoulder blade protruded 2-3 inches from my back for about 3 months. I tried going to physical therapy and few times but found it was not working and it was also too expensive ($100 per visit). The winged scapula finally went away on its own, but a lingering pain remained. When I put pressure on the exact point of the pain, it feels much better. This is only temp. relief. I've found that heavily working my arms and shoulders temporarily numbs the pain as well (ex. Boxing, weightlifting). When I get busy with work and spend long hours at the computer and standing up, my shoulder pain gets far worse. It comes back nearly full force to the night 4 years ago when I could not sleep. I've seen 6 specialist doctors and 1 chiropractor in the 4 years I've had this issue. Doctor #1 put me on steroids and said it would go away by itself in 1 year Doctor #2 gave me an EKG test and saw some failed nerves of the long thoracic. the test was performed with a needle which was inserted into my back , moved around and then repeated for an hour. Very painful. He also stated the pain would go away and that nerves repair themselves. he prescribed muscle relaxers. They made me very sleepy and it became hazardous to work/drive. Doctor #3 wanted to shoot me with steroids directly into the area of pain. I said no because I did a lot of research online and found it could have permanent damage if done so. Doctor #4 wanted to do another EKG test, I declined because that had already been done and did not go back to him. Chiropractor #1 Cracked my neck and my back for 3 weeks, twice a week. and I saw no results. Doctor #5 said that I needed physical therapy, I did not attend because of failure in the past plus cost of treatment. Followed physical therapy guide I found online for my condition, it helped temporarily but pain came back. Doctor #6 prescribed muscle relaxers. I took them and it did not fix the reoccurring pain.

I am 30, a FT (returning) student and FT manager and am feeling overwhelmed in my last semester before graduation. I have been throwing up when I wake up on busy days for nearly a year. I have panic attacks about twice a month which numb my face and blur my hearing. I believe that most of my anxiety is related to untreated ADD. My parents did not believe in it and ignored and were insulted by teacher conferences where it was discussed. I struggled to graduate highschool, but moved away from a chaotic situation and began community college, where I began using marijuana to focus. Suddenly, I was on the deans list, I have self-medicated this way since. Since I have a high gpa and no need for academic accommodation, my councilor sent me to the nurse she didn't feel the need to investigate add. The RN prescribed celexa, which has stopped the panic attacks and vomiting. With graduation approaching, I feel that the only way I can quit marijuana use and obtain a next-level position is by properly treating my ADD. I have quit pot multiple times for 2 months or so and I show up to work on my days off, lose my phone in the freezer/linen cabinent/street, and perform substantially lower on tests. So now what? How does a grown woman reach out for help with ADD? Oh and I don't have a family DR., I usually go 1-3 years between trips to urgent care, which is why I went to the medical center at school.

My grandfather's great aunt was only 12-16 as she had recently entered puberty and back then, there was no running water for poorer families in this area so they still had to get water from the well for a bath and warm it over the fire. Being a teenager, she didn't want to take that time, (as it's said) and she had just started her period and after she got into the cold water, soon after her body went into shock, she bled out and died. Years later, my great aunt's daughter was on her period and went to swim in the creek in the summer and she went into shock and it paralyzed her upper lip. I'm not sure if this tale is exaggerated or what condition this may be, but I was curious if anyone had any information at all as to what this could be. It obviously isn't something that happens often, but is this something that could happen in all women or possibly anemic women? Any information is helpful, just a curious mind.",

It didn't seem to bad and I kept driving the car until I got a new one in the first week of October. In the last two weeks of having the car, the leak got worse. I always drove with the windows down, but I could smell the gasoline. I had headaches all the time and had trouble focusing and thinking on my feet, especially while talking to people. After I got rid of the car I started to feel better and could think more clearly. Around the end of December I started having really bad anxiety and depression and can't focus again. I'm wondering if the prolonged exposure to the gas has affected me permanently, or if I'm just having anxiety and depression causing me to not focus and understand people. Thanks for any help!",

The noise is probably generated by the AC of the unit above me. The AC goes on and off, but mostly on, producing the noise at a frequency lower than 200hz and a noise level of around 40 db-A.  I've occasionally experienced headache since moving in, sometimes in the apartment, sometimes within one hour after leaving my apartment. For one night, I didn't wear ear plug before going to bed and had a really serious headache on the following day throughout the day. On the following night, I wore my ear plugs and went to bed, the headache pretty much disappeared on the day after. I'm just wondering, does the low-frequency noise directly contribute to this headache? Or I'm just too nervous about the noise so that the headache is produced from stress?  I really hope to find an answer here to see if I need to move out of the apartment or do something to make the situation better. Thank you very much!",

I am going through such a hard time so if anyone has any indicators or advice it will be taken with open arms! Three weeks ago I was a perfectly healthy 25 year old. That was a Monday by Tuesday I had a horrible headache on the left side of my head that included ear pain. I went to my primary care doctor who told me there was fluid in my ear. I was proscribed amoxicillin.  The headaches got worse and I had leg weakness and nausea in the morning for about 3 days. I ended up going to the emergency room. I got blood tests done which came back normal and a transvaginal/abdominal ultrasound which both came back clear. This may seem confusing why they did stomach/transvaginal ultrasounds. In June I had a miscarriage and earlier complaints led to testing to see if tissue remained. Diagnosis: headache would go away. There was indeed tissue left over but tiny amounts that would not cause issues and would go away with my next menstrual cycle. The headaches have continued (and doctors checking my ear after have all said there is no trace of fluid). The head pain now switched sides. From left to right. With intermittent ear pain.  Last week was week three. I went back to the ER and had a clear CT scan. I am being told its migraines.  I have never experienced migraines in my life and am open to the possibility but it doesn’t seem right. I went to an eye doctor, ear nose and throat doctor and the dentist over the last few days. All of which have cleared my eyes, sinuses and teeth to be in good health. The only indicators I am left with now are my blood results. My calcium was “normal high” and my vitamin d level was low. I am not, as prescribed by a doctor, taking vitamin d supplements for the next two weeks and cutting my dairy intake and then getting my levels retested in the next few weeks. ( I was born with hypothyroid and my levels were fine) I have a neurology appointment within the next week. Today was my breaking point as I been experiencing numbness in my head. I wish I could say this is anxiety/stress based but life has been very calm as of late and I never have had anxiety issues. The dentist did recommend sleeping with a mouth guard so I can/cannot rule out TMJ.  I got tested for lymes and it came back negative. Please advise, no doctor has listened when I mentioned the mosquito bite. I live in new jersey. The headaches all started the day after I got bit in the eyebrow. The headaches lasted the first full week on the same side/ear I was bite on. I just cannot get over the irony but I have been told its not a factor to consider. It is also my second month of a new birth control that fortunately due to timing I am stopping this weekend to see if that is a contributing factor even though the first month I had zero issues with it. I would really appreciate any help or direction!",

I was prescribed Concerta, and it seemed to work good. Right about when I was 18 maybe a little sooner It was switched to a generic version because generics were approved or whatever the reason was so Insurance would only cover the generic. My dose was 36 mg of Concerta and it switched to something else not sure the name but it was only like 9 mg of something. I stopped taking it before my second 30 day prescription was up. It wasn't doing what it was originally. Looking back know the generics should be the same mg amount from looking online, which may have been part of the problem. Something else I noticed was in 2015 only the Actavis generic was approved as a substitute for Concerta it was previously three different generics approved.  My main question after all of that is can my general family doctor re-prescribe me a add medicine, without seeing a psychiatrists again. The first time I went to a the family doctor he sent me to a psychiatrist and then psychiatrist sent me back to him to prescribe the dosage or whatnot. I am paying for all of this out of pocket so i don't want to pay for 3 doctors visit if I can get it done in one by either going straight to the psychiatrist or my family doctor.  Second question is that concerning prices I looked up prices on good RX and the closest thing other than approved Concerta generic which is $116 for a 30 day supply is the Ritalin LA generic which is like $68 for 30 days. Would he be able to switch what I was taking to the Ritalin LA, It is essentially the same drug but last 6-8 hours vs 10 to 12 for the Concerta. Still not sure which way I would go if he gave me the option but the Ritalin is half the price so it wouldn't hurt to try it.  It has been almost 6 years since my last prescription was filed if that matters. I started college a year ago and managed to somewhat handle my add problems but the same thing is happening that did when I started High School - when I get too much on my plate at once I just cant focus on almost any of it. I in general have trouble focusing but can most of the time force myself too, but like I said when I get loaded down I don't react normal by doing one thing at a time I just cant really start or finish anything. I also lost a job last year in part because of that.  Any help would be appreciated. When I get my tax return back in a week or two I am going to try to get back on it. I have the symptoms so I think I shouldn't have any trouble getting it, but want to do it the most cost effective way.","ADHD in Children , Living With , Symptoms , Treatment & Care , Diagnosis , ADHD in Adults"

Can Sudafed, Minoxidil and Calcium heartburn pills cause high BP and heart rate???","Hi, Yesterday, 12/28/17, I had a drug interaction. I was cleaning my wood pellet stove and during the process I noticed I was sweating and my heart was racing. I sat down in front of my clock and checked my heart rate, it was 162 BPM!  I had a doctor's appointment that day anyway, so I took a shower and got dressed to go to my orthopedic. I felt a little off while I was in the office and spent like I ran a marathon. When the nurse put the finger heart rate monitor on I noticed my heart was still running between 115 and 120. My BP was 140/110 also high. I think something I put into my body yesterday interacted with my prescription meds.  I said something to the nurse when I saw my heart rate, she said to speak to the doctor about it.  I started using Minoxidil 5% Wednesday to help thicken one side of my beard and assumed that maybe it was interacting with my meds because it was only my second day taking it. I checked for drug interactions and didn't see any between it and my meds when I started using it. The doctor told me that Minoxidil shouldn't cause this condition. The minoxidil box says Minoxidil can cause your heart to race. I googled minoxidil interactions and found several people who claim they had interactions immediately after using it.  I went home, alerted my psychiatric nurse and then took to the internet to try to find some answers.  My heart rate and BP came back down last evening.  I found several things that could have caused a problem and was hoping someone might be able to shed some light on the issue.  I take three prescription drugs daily 10mg ritalin 3x daily for ADHD (just started taking in May) 100mg Zoloft 1 x daily for PTSD 100mg Seroquel 1x daily for insomnia I went untreated for years and began to suffer extreme anxiety and depression, so I saw a doctor last November. Ultimately I was diagnosed as ADHD and PTSD. I've had sleeping problems since I hit puberty, it's genetic on my mother's side of the family so I addressed that too.  I also have SIBO, small intestine bacteria over production. I'm on a low FODMAP diet, and mostly use aloe vera gel and occasionally use calcium pills to control heart burn.  When I started taking these meds I was 20 pounds lighter. My resting blood pressure was 107/70 and my resting heart rate was about 55-60.  I started smoking again last year, then I injured my right forearm so I stopped working out on top of it all. My blood pressure has steadily climbed. At my last visit to my Psychiatric nurse WEDNESDAY this week my BP was 128/80 and my heart rate was 60 BPM.  I asked my nurse if she thought the Ritalin was causing my BP to rise, she said it's the smoking and lack of exercise. I quit smoking tobacco a month ago, and switched to an e-cig, I'm down to 3MG of nicotine, next step is 0 so I'm dealing with that. As soon as my arm is 100% I'll return to the gym too.  On Christmas Eve my wife made a beautiful spread of food I shoudn't eat, but I did anyway. On top of that I did some drinking, vodka, club soda and OJ over the weekend and through Wednesday night. My heartburn was out of control from Christmas eve and is just starting to subside right now so I've been taking more calcium pills to help control the heartburn.  I found an article that said Calcium pills can raise the PH level in your stomach which can cause Ritalin to absorb more into your blood stream.  I found another article that said Minoxidil can cause a racing heart rate because of a sudden decrease in blood pressure. The article said that your heart will race to bring your blood pressure back up, but no data to confirm that hypothesis.  I've also got a cold, I've been taking a generic Sudafed 12 hour for a week or so too. I found that the Sudafed I was taking can interact with Ritalin, but again no data to confirm. By the way it's real Sudafed, not the PE. And for the record I took some Sudafed this spring and didn't notice any problems, but I was 20 lbs lighter and in better shape.  Did I mix a dangerous concoction of Ritalin, Sudafed, Calcium pills? I didn't take Ritalin, minoxidil or Sudafed today. I'm gonna just deal with the cold, and would love someone to weigh in on what could have caused this issue.  That's all I've got. Thanks in advance.","Symptoms , Treatment & Care , Diagnosis , ADHD in Adults"

Since last November I have been having issues with blurred vision that comes and goes on a daily basis. When my vision is clear it is 20/20 or better (tested at opto) and when it's bad I can't read a stop sign when it's right in front of me. I also feel fatigued and fuzzy when this goes on. My vision fluctuates throughout the day and can change very quickly (within a couple minutes). It is blurry to some degree about 80% of the time. It all started in November of 2016 (no symptoms prior) when I had the worst migraine of my life. (I'm 26 and had migraines as a kid but was migraine free for 7 years before this). It started with visual aura and then led to incredible pain, blindness, numbness in my face and hands, fatigue, confusion, and eventually an inability to talk. I was able to speak words but they were random words, not what I wanted to say and then it got harder to speak until I couldn't speak at all. At the worst point I could barely stand and I was shaking very badly. A friend drove me to the ER on base (currently active duty) and they admitted me about 2 hours after this started. They thought I had done drugs (never have never will) so there was some delay while they did blood work to prove that it wasn't that. I was also throwing up the entire time. They did a ct scan and it came back clear on stroke, TIA, etc. so they sent me home when my symptoms began to get better (they gave me Benadryl).  Since then, the blurriness has been a constant issue and I've been working with a military neurologist to figure out what is going on. They did MRI's with contrast to check for MS etc., conductivity tests, field of vision tests, and sent me to an optomologist for a complete checkup etc. but they have all come back negative/clear. The final verdict the neurologist came up with was silent persistent migraine with aura. I would be inclined to agree with this except that when the vision is blurry, squinting clears it up as does a lense. Yet when my vision is clear, it is crystal clear. I can push through the fatigue and the fuzziness but the blurry vision is killing me and impacting my work. Does anyone have any insight to this or does anyone have a similar story with a treatment?

I just began highschool, and it's a bit rough. Throughout my school years, I've been known to have average grades or even exceeding ones with subjects I enjoy. Such as English, that's my only honors class right now. However, we've began to start reading a lot of different stories and novels. It's expected to constantly go through a lot of them within a certain time limit, and then to do an assignment. But, I'm having the hardest time just sitting down and reading through a book. Mind you, I love reading. I have thousands of books that I've gone through within reading websites. But now, I skip paragraphs, skim through them, because I can't seem to focus. Such as another subject, Living Environment. I really struggle sitting through class without my thoughts wandering off or becoming extremely fidgety or tedious for it to end. I just failed two out of three tests that were given, due to myself not being able to study, and to concentrate during class. It made me so upset with myself. And within out other subjects, when I am at that state of mind where I'm bored and uncomfortable, I kick or rapidly shake my leg, I doodle, play with my hands, I sometimes even ask to stand from my desk, and watch the time and figure out what I should do to pass it because I have a have a hard time tuning into a forty five minute lecture. It feels like a cloud in my head, whenever I have something mandatory to focus on, it seems nearly impossible. It's also effecting the things I enjoy doing. I draw a lot digitally, and sometimes it takes hours to do, but I try to begin something but I get so frustrated and stop. I love writing, but I try to start something and I stop because I lose motivation or I can't focus to continue. The thing is, I can focus on things such as conversations with my friends, and I don't feel the need to abruptly say something because I can't hold onto the thought, or focus on details when it's something I want to remember. I do sometimes have that need to like get up and do something, and I'm very unorganized within school or home.","ADHD in Children , Symptoms , Diagnosis"

I'm posting this for my mom because she has had a skin condition for the last 2 years and no matter how many doctors she goes to we cant find out what it is. She has been misdiagnosed with psoriasis and even exema but neither one of those treatments have worked. We have wasted hundred on different types of creams and even visiting different doctors but nothing yet. I'm hoping someone has been thru this before and has found out what it is. To give a little background story we used to have a dog that would pee all over the house and even on her bed. This skin condition developed around that time. We got rid of the dog but it has been getting progressively worse. It might be possible this has nothing to do at all with the dog but I wanted to add that in there. She tells me she feels like something is crawling under her skin. At first it was on her arms and back and she cant help but to scratch because the feeling of itchiness leaves her in agony. She is scared because now she has that same feeling on her face. We need to find out what this is before its too late. Please people I need your help. Here is a imgur link to  images    so that you can see what it is. I'm banking on WEBMD to shed some new light on what this can be,

I am not sending this to you to preach religion. I am asking you if you were standing before a Holy God do you think that He would have an issue with your sin if you were standing in front of a Holy God? Because that is exactly what the Bible tells us. That a Holy God can not be in the presence of sin. So every human being that has ever lived has had the exact same problem. This sin problem. But do you also know that Jesus Christ offers all of us a free gift, the forgiveness of sin. And faith and belief is all God wants from you. So, do you believe that Jesus was the Son of God who came to earth and lived a perfect life? Do you know that God will accept Christ's perfect life and let Christ be your Advocate, so on Judgement Day God doesn't look at all the bad stuff you've done. Instead, God will look at His perfect Son when He see's you. Because Jesus and His perfection literally stand in our place. Something like that. I would try to lay it out in the most simple terms so they know what the problem is and what the solution is and how it works. Then in the last sentence just write a quick sentence like ""there really is little difference between you and I, I am a sinner too. But I have accepted Christ's free gift of salvation and I know that I will be with God in eternity. I sincerely hope that this has helped you and I do apologize for being so forward, but I have to share this with you because I'm sure neither of us gets free gifts often. At this point, I would recommend for you a good Bible-based church that can answer any questions you have and will surround you with like-minded believers. Just Google bible church in your local area. God bless you!"" Rom 3:23 : For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Now that you know that no one is good in God's eyes, how do we then become good? How do we become vindicated before God? The Bible teaches that we need to have Jesus' righteousness but the only way to do that is to come to Him by faith: Rom 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Rom 10:10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Jesus commands everyone everywhere to repent of their sins, to ask for His forgiveness, and to turn from their sins and to put their faith and trust in Him. Repenting means that you are sincerely sorry for all the bad things you have done in life and you want Jesus to change you into his holiness and righteousness.",

Usually, it's more noticeable on a night. However, I also notice intense itching after shaving (even with a brand new razor and sensitive foam) and during temperature change, for example if I was outside in the cold and came into a warm home). In the last year, it seems to have gotten worse. The itching is so bad, I scratch at my legs until I leave scratch marks all over them and sometimes they even bleed. My legs look horrible some mornings after a night of scratching (on occasion I've done it without being aware, during sleep). It looks like I self harm sometimes when it's really bad.  I've tried washing in aqueous cream, moisturizing with coconut oil or bathing in it, I've recently been using Doublebase Gel as a moisturiser. I've stopped using fake tan, I very rarely use bath bubbles or anything that could irritate my skin...I don't know what else to try. The ONLY thing I could think of is that I have my shower too hot - i know I do. But surely this can't account for how bad it gets? Plus, I can scratch really bad when I haven't recently showered.

Last Sunday, my nose and upper lip went numb. Don't recall exactly when it started. I know I sneezed really hard with my mouth shut and felt extremely light-headed suddenly. Could've been after that? Don't recall. Throughout the week or eventually spread to my bottom lip, but no further. It's not totally numb, just very decreased sensitivity.  I went to an ENT due to drainage from a previous illness. He shrugged it off, said it was likely an inflamed nerve, and said I looked fine otherwise.  I was due to go on vacation the next day but was in such a state of panic that I cancelled and went to my regular doctor instead. She had a similar conclusion, that she really wasnt that concerned about it. We did bloodwork to rule out thyroid/B12 issues, which I won't know about til next week. She said she didn't feel like an MRI was needed yet, and gave me prednisone to help with what she thought was a nerve irritated by sneezing/coughing.  My nose and lips are slightly numb with pressure in that area, almost. I have dull pain behind my 2 front teeth, but no visible oral issue. I do have some TMJ aches, but no official diagnoses.  Now yesterday, my neck up to the base of my skull has started hurting. Same ache at my forehead, with a tightness at my temples and the crown of my skull. Still happening today. I spent most of yesterday anxious/stressed/crying, so could be a tension headache? It's not debilitating pain. I'm in a panic thinking that this numbness is because I have an aneurysm bulging against a nerve. Any insight would be much appreciated.

I have suffered from chronic sinusitis since I was a child and just learned of the balloon sinuplasty this year. I went to a local ENT at the recommendation of a coworker. They did a CT scan and noticed that my passageways were very narrow and said I would be a candidate for surgery. After fighting battles with insurance and paying an ungodly amount of money in copays I finally got my surgery scheduled. I wasn’t nervous as I had done a lot of research and heard that it wasn’t painful. Turns out.... IT WAS! The doctor came in and looked in my nose and asked if I had used Afrin as asked beforehand.. I had but apparently not close enough to surgery time so i was a little congested. He seemed annoyed and threatened not to do my surgery. He placed some afrin swabs in my nose and let them sit and then opted to do the surgery. I was given no sedative. They simply sprayed numbing spray and inserted some gel. When they went in and did the balloon, it hurt so bad I was hysterically crying. I was not nearly numb enough for this to be happening. They were able to do 3 of the 4 passageways but it was absolutely unbearable. After the surgery, my head had a dull headache but the pain medication has helped with that. I was wondering if anyone else had a similar experience with the balloon sinuplasty as far as pain goes. I was really upset with the whole process and the way the surgery was performed.

ADD/ADHD,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/30565/please-help,Please help.,"Hello! I am a junior in high school right now. I've always had trouble focusing on whatever anyone would say and can't understand direction until reading it slowly over and over again. I also daydream uncontrollably- sometimes to the extent of wasting 2-3 hours in one time doing so. In around 5thgrade, I would regularly sleep at around 12 am doing homework because I just could not focus. I would also keep bugging my friends to teach me what the teacher just taught because I could not focus on what the teacher was saying during his teaching. Then middle school came and the homework load doubled causing me to sleep on average at 1 am. The high school started along with volunteer and work and I began to sleep at 2-3 am. However, things have just spiraled out of my control this year. I am taking 6 AP classes right now along with 3 volunteer events per week along with work from 3-10 after school on Fridays. This is causing me to sleep at around 3-5 regularly- while waking up at 6:45. I really feel like I can't do this anymore. Homework is taking way too long to finish (I usually take much more time completing classwork that the rest of my classmates) and studying is just too hard because I always end up daydreaming- even when I have an exam the next day. My parents have always been academically strict so I have always maintained straight A's including this semester... so far. I just don't know how I am going to continue this with my terrible concentration and my inability to process information quickly. I wanted to let my parents know about my problems and to ask to find a psychologist who can tell me if I have ADD or ADHD or not but my parents don't really believe in ADHD. I've told my mother once but she told me that everything was just mentality and that I just need to have more willpower to get things done. But I know that that's not true. I'm struggling- not with the courses or even my schedule but that fact that I just don't have control over them. I wanted to get your input on what you think of my case. In your personal opinion, do you think I may have ADD or ADHD? Do/did you face similar problems as I have and still am? If you do see similarities between your case and mine, how do you think I should approach my parent to let me talk to a professional?

I would only really take the medication during school months, to help with my focus, motivation, and to help pay attention in class easier.  Now my question is : After taking this amphetamine for about 17-18 years basically religiously. Is there any way I could have long term side effects from this drug. Ranging from brain problems to depression, to physical harm to my body? Now i have noticed throughout the years i have been depressed, suicidal thoughts, as well as well as a HORRIBLE lack of focus and motivation to the point where i cant even hold a job for a long period of time and even horrible anxiety, I can never sit still and find it just amazingly hard to focus on anything.  I have read many articles researching about long term side effects from prolonged usage of this drug. But it just seems nobody can answer MY type of question.  I also know that since 1990 the dosage for children has dramatically decreased, as i was on 30mg for most of my life. Kids today don't go near that much mg of Adderall XR. From what i understand.  So if there is someone out there who could definitively give me an answer on what could possibly be going on...please let me know. Maybe i should finally seek a doctor? or i should try therapy? maybe counseling?","Symptoms , Treatment & Care , ADHD in Adults"

Psychiatrist has been on vacation, and I need to get this sorted out ASAP.","BASIC INFO: Age: 23, Male, 5'11'', 148.5 lbs, white Diagnosed with: Severe clinical depression, Asperger's, OCD, severe anxiety disorder, ADHD. Medications I take daily: Venlafaxine (225mg, at night), Bupropion (300mg, morning), Clomipramine (50mg) Medications I rarely take (~1 every 2-3 months?), but have, to deal with anxiety: Propranolol (20mg), Clonazepam (.5mg) After taking mirtazipine (45mg) for ~11 years, my psychiatrist and I decided to ween me off of it (she thought I could quit cold turkey, but I wanted to be more careful), and start taking clomipramine (which she said would have the same effect on my sleep as the mirtazipine, and help with the OCD). Starting on the 9th, I took 22.5mg of mirtazipine and 25mg of clomipramine. Then on the 19th, 11.25mg of mirtazipine and 50mg of clomipramine. Then for the last two nights, just the clomipramine. For the longest time, my ability to sleep was dependent upon the mirtazipine. Going to half a pill didn't do me any good. After going from a half to a quarter, my sleep suffered greatly. After dropping it entirely, things have just gotten worse. I hoped that the clomipramine would do the job just as well, but it's done nothing good for me, as far as I can tell. I'm groggy from the time I wake up, until I go to bed (but at that point, I'm not groggy enough to go to sleep right away, as I was with the mirtazipine). The depression and OCD are seemingly unchanged, though dealing with them is harder because I'm extremely exhausted and drained at all times. I need to get back on the mirtazipine, and get off the clomipramine, but I don't know the pace at which I can safely do that. My psychiatrist was on vacation last week, their office is closed tomorrow, and I have an appointment for Tuesday, but I'm supposed to go on vacation on Wednesday. I need to figure out how to handle this ASAP. I haven't been on vacation in years, I was so looking forward to this, but I'm worried I'll be too tired and out of it to drive anywhere, or do anything. Can anyone help me out on how I should proceed?",

Beginning last week, the second week of recovery, we have been encountering some very scary symptoms. The day the symptoms started, she went to the pool and then watched a soccer game that night. What started as night-time confusion has turned into full out delirium. Currently she is hearing familiar voices during the day when it is completely quiet, hearing different noises, getting confused mid sentence, and feels as though she is literally losing her mind. She was prescribed percocet and a basic nausea pill, which she only took for the first week after surgery. We have taken her to multiple doctors and hospitals but everyone seems to think it is psychological, which is okay but they aren't giving us any definite answers.

Ive became sick in April 2016 and have not been the same since. I had mri, ct, blood work, stool samples, eyes checked , seen ent and everything came back good but Im far from good Sorry for the long msg but this is affecting my life so much and here is a long history of how it all started April 2016 I woke up one morning up to my work hotel (I work in another province) and it felt like I was drunk! Everything i tired to look at I couldn't. It was all a big blur. I didn't go to doctor until my left arm started to go numb and II couldn't focus on anything. Also my head was very lightheaded. (not sure if a coincidence or not but two nights before at work I got very cold, so cold in fact I couldn't talk proper afterwards for a little while. The cold came from my lower back and my left side of face was causing the problem for trying to talk. Anyways I went to doctor and just said I was dissy and he said I had vertigo and gave me serc and it went away. Before it went away I had very bad motion sickness which I never had A week later I returned home the symptoms came back (not s bad as initial drunk feeling) after I tried to clean my ears (or that's my guess). My left arm went a little numb again. I got sec again from another doctor. My focus problems improved but I could telll something is off and not rite. FYI I continued to take sec until June 2017!! Had bloodworm done, ct scan, stool sample and everything came back good but I still felt lightheadness, and was off and hard time to focus. Doctors just though crystals in my ears were off Went to ent in August 2016. He finally explained that I didn't have vertigo as I'm lightheadness and I didn't have vertigo which is the room is spinning around me and all ear tests came back good. He couldn't understand why sec would work as to him it should be useless. He proceeded to clean my ears and removed a large chunk of wax from left ear. two days later my left side of my face and my neck went numb. Felt very weak. I went to doctor who then thought I had nerve damage from the cold and requested I see neurologist.. I couldn't and still can't put anything in my ears such as listening to music as it makes me sick the next day Tried to give up my sec pills but when I did my left eye would vibrate and i couldn't focus so I got back on them Seen neurologist. in november 2016. He said to him everything seemed fine even though I told him I feel way of. He requested a mri I continued to feel off and lightheadness and hard to focus and if i forgot a serc pill I would feel worst November 2016, shoppers drug mart gave me the generic of serc which made me very sick and didn't work for me also Had Mri Feb 2017 on my head. Everything came back good. Then in early March I felt perfect, best i did in years then all of a sudden mid march it was like April 2017 all over again but kinda different. My left eye wouldn't stop vibrating, I couldn't focus, felt like gonna throw up, and was gonna pass out at random times. This went away (back to my new normal which still wasn't perfect). I was at work april 2017 and got very sick again. Hard to focus, but this time felt very warm and flustered like I had a fever or blood pressure was up. My legs would burn. I checked blood pressure and it was good. I would feel the worst in the mornings and feel overheated after lunch. I had severe motion sickness. I had to be driving. and if I had to stop and go a lot in traffic it would make me feel sicker. This went away after 2 weeks and back to my new normal.  I gave up sec pills June 15th to see how I would be when seeing the ent. I was a little bit worst but not totally I went back to ent last week and he said again it's not a ear problem and has referred me back to a neurologist. He cleaned my ears and now I feel very off again I do have anxiety over this all as I have a fear of getting sick and not working as I have a lot of bills. He said this could make symptoms worst. Im very tired all the time. My left arm feels weaker than right arm. If I make sharp left turns it feels worst than right turns. Hard for me to focus as I like to drift off when somebody is talking to me. This is affecting my work as I usually work at heights but have not since and my work choices are limited Anxiety does run in my family but I only have it since I got sick. Could you wake up feeling like your drunk and serc help and it be anxiety? the part with things in my ears making me sick throws off the anxiety part. Im just not sure what tests are going to be next. I am overweigh a bit (511 and 220 as I stop exercising) and have diarrhea daily since a year Sorry for the long rite up but this has been a very hard year and I have a 2 year old son and have been sick for half of his life so far any suggestions greatly apppreciated",

In 1996, I had a schizophrenic breakdown, was put on Thorazine and Haldol and other ancient drugs with terrible side effects. My brain scan showed that I have abnormal left lobe activity. I also had breakdowns in 1997 and 2012, when off medication. About three years ago, I had several hours in which I was amazingly abnormally confused. I was asked at the hospital the name of my father, and I said something like ""January 29th."" I vomited, had a brain scan, they told me it was not serious, just a migraine. My psychiatrist said it was not a normal brain scan. Then I had several terrible seizures in public in which I just blacked out and woke up a few hours later in the hospital. I was put on medication, which eventually worked, and I quit worrying. Then around Christmas last year I had a spell in public in which I could think fine, but I could not walk. I was staggering around and all I could do was sit down for another hour or so. I went to the emergency room, did my best to demand an MRI, and they told me flat out that it cost too much. I am on Medicare/Medicaid. That is government health care. They don't care. The doctor did that sign-of-the-cross thing before my eyes and told me there was no neurological damage. They told me I was dehydrated. Right after that I started having massive memory lapses. I still have them. They come and go. When I walk more than a little, my legs and occasionally my arms tingle and feel cold, and lately it becomes kind of painful, but goes away eventually. I started feeling nauseous about two months ago. I didn't vomit, and it got better, but about two weeks ago I did vomit all night. My bones ached too, so I think it was the flu, but I've felt more or less sick ever since. I went to the hospital for five days for an EEG screening for epilepsy, about a month ago. I had a grand mal seizure. I finally got an MRI, by begging, it took me six months. I learned I have a brain lesion in the left lobe, where memory is controlled. I was told I might have had it all my life. They aren't taking me seriously. Can I do anything about all this? Beg for a lesionectomy?",

Nothing else worked.Why didn't the Doctor ever wonder to herself, ""why does this patient of mine keep getting recurring cold sores ?""Well after watching the ""Doctors"",I knew immediately it was the adderall and after doing my own research sure enough there were plenty of others who documented that they would get cold sores too and it was caused from the mixture of her Adderall and the sun and heat.I totally stopped her medicine and today,it's 9/11, and she is at the beach with no cold sores for over a month!.She is 15 now and I can remember back on 9/11/2001,she was a little baby in my arms and I heard someone yell ""Turn on the T.V. a plane just crashed into the Twin Towers.!""Hope to hear from a lot of you!",Symptoms

ALWAYS has. He chooses to eat that more than anything else .  So we thought it was absolutely weird and we would have NEVER thought that it was the pizza... My sister & the kids went to a Birthday party at Chuck-e-Cheese that evening,  (Remind you they ALL ate the pizza, all 4 of them ate the pizza, but ONLY my nephew broke out) so when they got home they noticed that he had broken out all over his body even behind his ears & all that. We thought it was from when we gave him a shower and used this new cheapish kid shampoo ... They ended up going away after a oatmeal bath & some children's allergy meds... But the next early afternoon about 11:30am this kid of course wanted some pizza.. He had just woken up & everything so we know he hadn't done anything, nor ate anything yet as well BESIDES the left over pizza from Chuck-E-Cheese.. We come back in the room after 5 MINUTES of giving it to him, he was COVERED again, he had broken out all over again. We called to get the ingredients but NOTHING was standing out.. Of course we gave him another oatmeal bath and then gave him a bit of allergy meds as well and of course it went away again.  They have not came back at all thank God but we are just curious and VERY confused so if anyone thinks they know what it was could you let me know i'd absolutely appreciate it...

I get itchy in other areas of the house but I don't want to say where exactly because I don't want to give possibly inaccurate information since I only noticed once and was first time it happened of course and so I didn't bother pay attention thinking I was gonna be fine. Anyway a little history to hopefully rule some stuff out and also give opportunity to things that may not be likely for most people. My dad takes care of a kid who breaks out so far that I know in all the same ways I do to bugs (but I can't vouch for all situation can say bed bugs we do break out just the same) So because he's not breaking out I know it's not bed bugs. This kid hasn't broken out and I've mentioned to my dad that something must be wrong because I'm breaking out. I've sat on this couch over the years with no issues except for when we did have bed bugs of course. I'm allergic to fleece and/or whatever fire-retardant they use we aren't sure. I've been told once that what I was buying didn't have any fire-retardant and I still broke out but I'm unsure of reliability of whoever told me that. Dad has a fleece blanket which sometimes he sleeps on that couch with. The couch I have at my home is similar in material and has suffered the same or worse fates from animal dander/hair. Dad has no animals for years and I have 2 cats which I'm very allergic too. At this point I've given about as much as I can think to and so I'll let you ask questions you have or answer if it's possible what you think it might be. I just want to find what is happening to maybe fix it so I can enjoy visiting my father again.,

I respect my doctors and other medical professionals immensely, but I am genuinely desperate. In October (about 5 months ago) I visited my PCP after feeling sickly for weeks on end. I had been having low-grade fevers on a daily basis, joint pain and general aches, and fatigue so bad I would sleep for 16 hours. My blood work came back with normal CBC, but positive for mono. I was given prednisone (which did nothing) and told I would feel better in a week or two. 5 months later, my symptoms have only gotten worse. With my fevers come a bright red butterfly shaped rash across my face, and I am often too sick to get out of bed. I visited the doctor once again, who agreed that the fevers were not likely caused by the mono I had five months ago. She thought there was a chance of an autoimmune condition, so tested my ANA, CRP, CBC, ESR, and for lyme (for good measure). Yet, every single test came back within the normal range. I had been treated for kidney pain recently as well, but all that showed up in my urine was a little protein and white blood cells (but not an amount too excessive). With having tested negative for lupus, lyme, and any sort of infection, I do not know what to think. My fevers have not subsided, and the rash on my face shows up a few times a week at least (it's not itchy, just hot). I also continuously break out in hives, despite having had allergy testing (not sure if this is related). If I don't have an autoimmune condition, lyme, mono, or any infection, why on earth am I feeling so sick and what can I do to feel better?

I am 16, going on 17, and I've been diagnosed with ADHD since I was 5 years old. My mother has it and my grandfather on her side does too. My mother has a more concentrated form of it, but there are a lot of things she doesn't understand when it comes to mine when I try to explain. I was wondering if what I notice is still ADHD or if it is something else. I've tried looking it up, but you know the internet. Type in any symptoms and it turns out I have cancer and 53 other diseases. I was diagnosed with Seasonal Depressive Disorder last year, but I don't feel depressed right now. I don't feel the same as I do when I am depressed. What's going on has been happening for most of my life. I always have a hard time remembering something or sticking to any routine. Even if I've been doing something for months on end, I will at some point stop, but not on purpose. It's more like I stop doing whatever it is without noticing and form a new routine that isn't helping me. I have huge gaps in my memory of important things and I can't remember much from my childhood, but when I do remember things, they are very trivial. I will remember exactly what someone was wearing the day of my 10th birthday, but I can't remember any thing that happened last year at school or what important thing someone said to me last week. I have very low motivation to do anything, even though I *know* I need to do it. Time passes me by, three hours will go by and I feel like it's been one hour. I feel like I do everything on autopilot, but I'm still very aware of what is going on around me. I can't focus, even when I take my Ritalin. I feel like I don't have the same range of emotions as everyone else. I've tried bringing that up with my mother but she says that if I was apathetic then I wouldn't be worried about it. I don't get sad about things I should get sad about and I tend to get more angry about things than normal. I'm not violent, but I have felt the need to be more aggressive about things, although I never have because I know that's not how one is supposed to react. I compulsively lie about things that are trivial and have no importance to anything. I don't lie with an end goal or for some purpose, I just say something false and afterwards I usually ask myself why I did. there's no point to it and I don't get anything out of it. I don't know if these are all because of ADHD or something else. Maybe I'm just a bad person? Please give me your thoughts.  Side note: I don't think it's because I was raised a certain way. My mom definitely has tried to change these things, but she seems to think they are deliberate actions on my part. Nothing is on purpose, I just don't notice it. Also I'm not uneducated, I have IQ of 145, so none of this is from a lack of knowledge.","ADHD in Children , Living With , Symptoms , Treatment & Care , Diagnosis , ADHD in Adults"

Starting the new year, I started getting itchier and itchier. I thought maybe it was mold. No. Allergies? Not that I know of, but I know things can change. Kidneys? Perhaps, I’m on a round of antibiotics currently for an infection, cipro first (where I had a decrease in itching symptoms) but the culture showed it to be resistant to cipro so they put me on Bactrim instead and the itching is back. It’s not always present either! Feels like crawling, prickling, burning. I’ve sanitized my house over and over to kill potential mites and mold. Did a mold test and it was negative. I’ve never had a problem with mites before. There are no bites, no hives, no rash really (hard to tell, my skin can get blotchy for no reason), no bites, and nothing visible on my skin causing the irritation (lice, visible mites/scabies/bird mites, etc). I live in a country area, I have a cat and two dogs. I find putting on clothing intensifies the effect, freshly washed clothing not as much. Like I said, while I was taking cipro, I had almost no irritation, and now I’m dying... that’s an exaggeration, but I’m EXTREMELY uncomfortable and distressed. Lotions help for a few seconds, but then it just comes back. Cool air helps as well. I’ve never had a problem like this before and I don’t even know what to tell a doctor except that I have horrible itching and they just keep telling me to change my detergent, or other things that don’t work.

It sometimes produces small red bumps, and other times, slightly larger skin colored bumps. Regardless, they're only itchy when the bumps appear, and usually disappear if I resist scratching them for an hour or two. These are always on the right side of my right thigh (usually colorless here) all the way down to the right side of my right knee (usually red here). This time they were rubbed and gave the usual colorless bumps on my thigh that were itchy, but they've been here for a day and a half which is unusual. They also turned red overnight (still a usual color, they just don't usually change colors, and usually only red by the knee). There is also a small, nonpainful bruise in the general vicinity that I don't know how it got there. I am a 24 year old, generally healthy male. I have no known allergies, but I am on Lamotrigine, monteleukast sodium (for a nagging cough of unknown origin), atorvostatin, intuniv, and adderall. Thank you!!",

I waited a long time to get in to see the psychiatrist and therapist, as I have children and a family to care for. I cannot function without my meds, and they have told me that unfortunately since it came up negative they would have to stop prescribing. I guess my question is, are there ANY reasons why this might have happened? I take my medicine every morning as prescribed, and I really would just like to not be labeled as a criminal or a drug dealer on my medical records...

It's probably been ongoing for a year or more but is now much worse. It makes no difference to scratch the skin. What seems to help sometimes is to massage the area which is the upper rib cage right side near the nipple. There is no definite source I can determine other than this area which is about the size of my hand. If I scratch it it comes back with vengeance. This condition asserts itself several times day and night. An episode lasts for up to an hour. Constant massage probing and pushing with fingers will to calm it. Sometimes it's best to just bear the itch which will then stop after a few seconds turning to something between pain and itching. Then in a few seconds it returns. Again I can't pinpoint a definite location as you could with a bug bite. So could this be a symptom of a disease? I know itching can be a sign of healing. A year or two ago I had gynecomastia surgery-no cancer was detected but there was an area near and under the nipple that was sensitive to pain and may still be present. This was in addition for appearance sake the reason for the surgery. However the itching along with that pain may have been present before the surgery.,

Many people who suffer with adult ADHD are often misdiagnosed with symptoms arising primarily from undiagnosed and untreated ADHD. Some common diagnosis that can occur due to undiagnosed Adult ADHD are Depression, Anxiety, substance use disorders, mood disorders and or personality disorders often these diagnosis are not invalid or in fact co-morbid with ADHD the problem is that until your ADHD is diagnosed and treated properly you can continue on this diagnostic merry go round for along time and much unnecessary suffering and trouble can be avoided if you make sure properly assessed for Adult ADHD in the first place. ADHD in Adults is a lot more Common than once thought with up to 1/15 Adults meeting the diagnosistic criteria for Adult ADHD. Signs that you may have undiagnosed Adult ADHD are commonly problems with Substances use, impulsive and risky behaviours, trouble with the law, not able to fulfil your potential, a sense of constant boredom or feeling like you're different some how and can't seem to achieve what you would like too. Problems with employment, Feeling like your flawed or helpless, low self esteem, sleep problems, trouble starting and completing jobs or projects constantly changing what your doing yet never quite getting things done. This can lead to feelings of depression, anxiety, frustration, agititaion and for the need to self medicate with alcohol and other drugs. Smoking cigarettes and or marijuanna , gambling, spending too much having too much sex etc. so if you feel like you're struggling and not getting anywhere if you have had a childhood diagnosis of ADHD or someone in your family has or you just feel it's something that might be playing a part in your problems please seek help from a Psychiatrist who specialises in Adults ADHD they are out there you can find them in Australia buy checking out the Australian Psychiatric Board site by searching For FRANZCP this site has a very useful too, that allow you to search for Psychiatrist who deal specially with this problem and can help you. I strongly recommend checking this out and making the effort to have yourself assessed as the benefits of proper treatment are massive and the consequences of not being diagnosed are massive and potentially life threatening this is my experience and it took me too long to get the help I needed and my life has completely turned around since I received my diagnosis and have been on treatment for nearly three years now. ADHD is absolutely real it's a disorder with a neurological basis that affects every area of your life and it doesn't magically disappear once where Adults in fact over 60% of the 1/10 children diagnosed with ADHD will continue to experience profound problems with ADHD right throughout Adulthood.","Symptoms , Diagnosis , ADHD in Adults"

I have spent a lot of years finding resources and strategies that help manage his symptoms and behavior.  As an early childhood educator, I know how different every child can be – and diagnosis or not, knowing what he needs has made life so much calmer for all of us. The foundation of my philosophy in my preschool classroom is that children need play to thrive. I’ve found that this helps at home, too, and the more playful we all are, the easier it is for my son to stay in control and enjoy life.  Negative self-talk is a huge issue for him, and finding playful ways to change that has made a big difference (for instance, he substitutes a nonsense word (snarkydoodles) for “dumb.” It makes him laugh, and then the moment of negativity passes.  I found a great book, Playdhd, by Dr. Kirsten Milliken that has helped me look at play as a resource. She has a great Facebook page as well. Play is so important – and she has some great ideas and suggestions on how to be more playful to help manage ADHD.  Has anyone else experimented with play to manage symptoms?

A few months ago I was offered to smoke marijuana for the first time in my life, being a second year college student who has never tried marijuana before, I decided to give it a shot.

Eventually bummed out by the experience, I tried again, nothing happened. I attempted smoking 4 times before I concluded it didn't work.

Allergies,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/allergies/35736/did-i-outgrow-my-tree-nut-allergy,Did I outgrow my tree nut allergy?,"Since I was 2 years old, I've had a severe allergy to tree nuts (no problems with peanuts). As soon as something containing a tree nut enters my mouth, I immediately go into anaphylaxis. I don't even have to swallow it.  My first time having an allergic reaction wasn't horrible. I ate one of those round chocolates with the walnut at the center. It felt as though I had suddenly gotten the flu. My throat got itchy, my tongue swelled a little, I felt overheated, I got sweaty, and looked really pale. It wasn't that bad.  My second one was awful. I was 4 (I think) and was at a friend's house. Her mom had baked cookies (with some sort of nut, obviously) and I asked if I could have one. She gave me a cookie and as soon as I bit into it, I felt my throat closing and spat out the piece that I had bitten off. I didn't even swallow it. I started struggling to breathe, coughing, wheezing, got very lightheaded, and my face was pale as a ghost. Luckily, my mom was still there and she took me to the hospital. They were able to get me feeling better and diagnosed me with a nut allergy and prescribed an epi-pen in case this were to happen again.  I was extremely careful with what I ate after that and I've never used the epi-pen. Didn't even cook anything with nuts (I really enjoy baking and I'm pretty good at it. By the way, I can touch and be around nuts with no issues. I just can't eat them. I do get itchy when I use shampoo and skin creams with nuts, but it's no big deal). However, there were a few occasions when I've had a reaction.  The third time I had a reaction was when I was 15 and ate a cookie that had been accidentally contaminated. It didn't usually contain nuts, it was just a manufacturing error (so I guess those ""made in a factory that also produces___"" warnings do matter. Who knew, right? Haha). My throat got itchy, I felt feverish, and I started feeling my airway constricting. I didn't have my epi-pen on me, so I drank a ton of water and I started feeling better. I didn't die, I didn't stop breathing. It was weird, but I was happy that I figured out how to stop it from escalating. I thought that maybe it was just because it wasn't contaminated enough to kill me. Either way, I was lucky.  I was even more careful after that and never had another problem involving nuts (I did develop an allergy to shellfish, dog saliva, and latex though). Earlier this evening, my dad offered me a piece of chocolate (orange flavored chocolate). I ate all of it. He read the label afterwards because I commented that it looked like there were pieces orange peel in it because there were light colored bits (like maybe that's what gave it the orangey flavor. Wasn't orange peel). It turns out that those were actually thinly sliced almonds. There were a lot in my piece, so I knew that the chocolate I ate had almonds. I had no symptoms, no reaction at all. That was several hours ago and I still feel perfectly fine. Well, as fine as someone with flu can be (I've had it for 2 days so far). What I meant was, I feel the same as I did before eating it.  So do I not have the allergy anymore? Did I outgrow it? I'm currently 19 years old and like I said in the beginning, I got the allergy when I was very young and it seemed to be very severe. When I got the test done to see which nuts I'm allergic to, I tested positive to all of them except English walnuts and peanuts. The doctor said all those years ago that I would never outgrow it. Was he wrong? Do I not have the allergy now? I'm glad that I didn't have a reaction today, but I'm kinda confused now. I don't know what to think, really.",Food

My throat and tongue weren't swelling at all, and the doctors didn't give me an e-pin, just gave me some liquid medicine to drink for the swelling and itching.

However, ever since then I've been terrified that it may have actually been the shrimp, and that I have a potentially life-threatening allergy waiting to be exposed once more. A few years ago I did go to an allergist about it, but both the blood and skin tests came back negative for shellfish. I was offered to do the ingestion test in the office, but declined.

He appeared to have no teeth, although I never looked closely enough so he may have had them. His lips curled over his gums kind of like a senior citizen. He was short in stature, and could not run. He bobbed his head back and forth as well as clapped his hands lightly and without any coordination constantly, almost like a neural tick. His verbal communication was limited to noises like ""meh"" and ""uh-huh"" (but not quite those words, I don't think I ever heard him use any discernible words) and he didn't seem to have any control over his vocal volume either.

I am so afraid she will not be able to take it anymore with no sleep or relief. Has been on neurontin which helped for 2 days but had to increase and increase for any relief but came to the point of made her shaky and speechless. Doctor said to stop immediately which she did but is itching tremendously. What could all this be. We have been through test after test after test as well. Is there anyone that can provide things to try other than the normal stuff that is always done. Are there any recommendations for any doctors that really want to help a person? Thank you,Treatment

I remember I took a mucinex to help with my sinus infection and I suddenly felt itchy and discovered hives forming on my arms and legs which then became rash patches. Usually around 2 or 3 rash patches will form and then go away. After they go away another 2 or 3 rash patches come up. I've been taking Cetirizine & methylprednisolone for it. I first started with the 6 day pack and it worked really well, but it never stopped my hives from appearing it just prevented them from becoming a rash. After I was finished with the 6 day pack it returned bad. My doctor is putting me on 1 daily methylprednisolone pill. It didn't stop it so I've been also taking Cetirizine. That worked out really well for awhile but now its not working that much anymore. Just a hour ago I started to get hives on my arm and I went to check on the rash patch I have on my leg and it was a deep purple. I took another Cetirizine and in just a couple of mins my leg rash was pretty much gone (a couple of red specs). Has anyone or does anyone know why its this constant pattern of one going away and another appearing?

The right side of my body is weaker as compared to left side and appears to be not developing as it should be. Due to this I feel pain in my right leg when put body weight on it similarly the right hand also pains when I push something hard or press something hard from it. My back also pains while sitting, driving or just standing. Because of this illness and pain I am having difficulties in standing, walking, sitting and lying.

Occasionally I feel headaches and sometimes when I bend down on knees it feels that all the matter in head has flown towards fore head making the head heavy.

Docs put me on two rounds of different antibiotics and finally felt better. They also told me to start using Flonase as well. So shortly after caught another cold and then started developing really bad ear pain.  That went on for 3 week's. Went on Augmentin after 2 1/2 weeks of dealing with the pain. It helped a little. Went on for another week. I saw an ENT who said hearing is good, pressure is good, and no fluids in the ear's. So two weeks passed caught another cold. Then week later ear pain. 2 weeks in dealing with the pain. I stopped taking Flonase think that somehow correlates with the tube issue's. Fluid sensation is gone. Now it's just a throbbing pain. Also a sensation that my tube in my ear feels like it's throbbing. Tried Sudafed and Advil first 2 days helped a little. Then just Advil and last 2 days just Asprin. Asprin does seem to help. Also now not on Sudafed I am sneezing more that relieves some pressure as well. However, pain is still there and causing tooth pain. As well as similiar symptoms are starting to appear in my right ear. On top of that feeling tired more than normal, ear's are itchy, lot more wax being produced, and ear's are red at times. Debating to go to the walk in clinic tomorrow. Now a day's Doc's are strict on giving out biotics. I know when I was a kid there was one year for 4 to 6 months my mom mention had really bad allergies and colds. That led to ear issues and the Doc prescribed me a low dose of Augmentin over the course of those few months. I feel if on another 5 days with the previous Augmentin think it would of cleared up the issue. My biggest concern is will the Augmentin still even work now. Any feedback or advice appreciate.",

When I was younger I was always social, good grades, etc. then it started changing. In middle school I remember starting to decline with friends. After High School, I attended 4 different colleges without finishing a semester, I have been through so many good jobs that never stayed with, very unorganized, forget why I entered the room and what I was getting, impulsive, interrupt people, etc. My doctor always treated it for depression and anxiety and placed me on meds. I stopped the meds months ago and I am not depressed but that was to mask what is really going on. I am beginning to be depressed again because my mind is ready to explode with so much to do and I feel like I am loosing my mind. Every time I get off the meds I finally see what is going on with my life, financially distressed, work problems again, extremely disorganized, forgetting school things , messing up with my work this is when I would go back on the anti-depressants so I wouldn't realize what was really going on and what my life is becoming.  I am not 100% diagnosed yet, but I know that this is what it is. I need my mind to be focused to help my family but I feel so crazy inside my head like so many things going on. Also, is it possible for all of my children to have it as I see signs in them as well.  Any input would be greatly appreciated as my family doesn't understand and think I am making up excuse, but I know I am not. Who would be the best to diagnose this?

I don't know what it is as nothing here has really changed. I've tried a number of different allergy medications but Benadryl is the only thing that helped. Nothing else even helps a little. The thing is that Benadryl knocks me out. Like to the point where I am so tired I can't even think about work. Obviously that's not ideal for when I'm at work. I am miserable but trying to avoid Benadryl so that I can actually get work done. Does anyone know if they make non-drowsy Benadryl? Or anything else I can maybe take?","Seasonal , Treatment"

Someone recommended I take a molybdenum supplement to help rid the aldehyes from my body. But I've been told that if you've ever had gout you should not take molybdenum as it will make it worse. I do not believe I currently have gout but back in college I was on a vegan diet (eating lots of beans, grains, and brewers yeast) and the base of my right big toe would feel like it was being chewed off by an animal at night. I searched out the symptoms on the internet and since it sounded like gout I stopped eating as much of those things and the pain disappeared. So though I want to take molybdenum to help with the aldehyde problem I'm fearful that it might be the wrong thing to do. Any advice? Additional information so you know something of my body chemistry: I am borderline anemic and have been for years, none of the dietary changes (steak cooked in a cast iron skillet and eaten with orange juice, blackstrap molasses) made any difference, oh, and iron supplements make me nauseous. Also, I recently discovered that taking a calcium supplement (taken so I could build up my bones since I've started going to the gym) makes my joints and ligaments ache and pop, the problem went away since I stopped taking them.

I’m a 30 year old male that has suffered from a long list of chronic severe symptoms for most of my life. Dozens of specialists consultations and different tests and treatments have yielded no results. Recently, I tried a potassium gluconate supplement. I experienced rapid and dramatic reduction in all of my symptoms. This effect has been repeatable for 2 months. If I stop the supplementation, the symptoms return within a day. Severe, chronic symptoms improved: • Asthma and respiratory issues. • Nasal congestion. • Constipation. • Headaches. • Muscle cramping, weakness and pain. • Insomnia. • Palpitations. I’ve also suffered from unexplained osteoporosis since my twenties. It would be life-changing to finally know what has caused me so much suffering throughout my life. This potassium effect is my first piece of evidence that might help me solve the mystery. I would appreciate any opinions and theories! I’m booked to see an endocrinologist. Suggestions of other recommended specialists are welcome. I’m taking 400mg to 800mg of potassium gluconate per day. I understand that this is within a safe dosage range.

Then after changing doctors again they accused her of bulemia (she is a healthy weight and eats well) and then later tested for anemia (cleared as well) all of which make no sense for treating a condition she has had diagnosed on many previous occasions throughout her childhood and adulthood.

ADD/ADHD,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/687/need-help,Need help,"My son is 11, he has ADHD and and severe anxiety. He's a real challenge especially lately. This week alone, he was suspended from school and used my credit card and visa debit online for purchases. He is explosive and impulsive.  His suspension was a result of becoming threatening to his teacher. While out I the wilderness on a field trip, he strayed away from the group and when found by his teacher he shared he was ready to go home and wanted to leave. The teacher attempted to get him back to the camp site while the others were off on a nature walk. He became irritated and began to pick up rocks as a means to scare her. Each time he throw them, they would be off to the side. She explained he did not intend to hit her. Once one was thrown, he'd go for another and each time they got bigger. She explained she would inform him that he could hurt her and eventually stated he could kill her. She became scared enough to break out in a cry. He immediately turned off his behaviour and followed her to site. While there and before leaving, various adults approached him to talk and his response was swearing and demanding to return home.  When I picked him up that day, I knew things didn't go well. He was visibly sad, withdrawn and angry. He shared wanting to return home and stated he had gotten mad. When I asked if he hurt someone, he stated he threatened his teacher with a rock, but wasn't going to hit her.  The school wants to have a restorative practice circle to discuss the incident and work through the trauma. I have explained this approach would not be successful as he is not built to talk about feeling openly as they expect and he will automatically come to the defence (fight or flight). I feel this is more adult focused then child focus. Since the beginning of the year, he hasn't really attended and the days he has there has been some sort of difficulty. More days than none anyway.  The night following his incident with the teacher, he refused to talk about it and when I would approach him his eyes immediately filled with tears. That night he tossed and turned and had three panic attacks; finally falling asleep at 5am. The second night the same, but without the panic attacks.  This week, he also got ahold of my visa and made approx. $300 in charges. When I approached him, he knew he was at fault and the guilt showed. I took away his PC and he didn't put up a fight as he normally would. Usually he would become loud, angry and physical. This was yesterday when I discovered his actions and last night he again was anxious and slept at 5am.  Today we are on eggshells, he is explosive, angry and asking for his PC. There no way that he can be left without constant supervision. I feel so helpless, at a loss and very disappointed. I don't know what to do anymore. He informed me that he will not be going to school and doesn't care.  I have to work, care for my little girls and I need to breathe. I don't know if I can be his mother, it feels as though we failed. We tried rewards, loss privileges, incentives, nothing has worked.  I feel as though he is out of control and ruling our lives. He was on Strattera and Intuniv, but has been weaned as these difficulties were apparent while medicated.

I've had the whole range of tests done, but so far nothing conclusive has come up. Recently I began to experience symptoms similar to those of MS- vision problems, muscle weakness, trouble focusing and remembering words, tremors in my hands, frequent urination- and starting about two weeks ago I've been getting vertigo. It happens mainly when I'm walking, but also while sitting or standing still, and feels sort of like my eyes have suddenly unfocused without my permission. At first it was quick and infrequent, but its been happening more and more and become painful and more intense. I'll feel pain behind and above my right eye and moving to the left, traveling over the brow bone, and I'll feel nauseous and lose all train of thought. The swirling sensation lasts for a few minutes, and will repeat in waves if I try to move after the initial pain has stopped. Today it happened so abruptly that my knees gave way and I had to catch myself on a door frame to lower myself to the floor. It does seem to help if I focus on a single unmoving object?  My question is, how long do I wait before this becomes something that needs to be seen right away? I have an appointment with neurology coming up in a few weeks, but with the sensation getting worse and, frankly, scarier, I'm wondering if I should go into urgent care sooner than that. If I wait for my appointment, am I risking this developing into something less treatable? Is it an indication that something is going on that can't wait? Or should I wait until I faint to head to urgent/emergency? Thank you!",

Only problem with this is they have to cut the nerve sheath which can cause nerve damage also depending on where the tumor is located the surgeons have to cut through muscles causing more damage.  No one in my family has this disease the doctors believe it was a genetic mutation that caused this.  I'm in severe pain 24/7 my pain pills do absolutely nothing, I'm on Oxycodone 15mg 4 times a day, Methadone 10mg 2 times a day and 20mg once a day I also take Lyrica 2 times a day.

About two months ago I started waking up with my whole body feeling like it was shaking only to not be moving at all. I figured I was pretty stressed out with school so I dropped a class that was giving me a lot of stress and although I don't wake up feeling like I'm shaking violently I always still feel the shaking when I'm falling asleep and when I wake up. Related to this I believe are these muscle spasms I have which have started this month, seemingly random muscles that I didn't even know existed will start twitching completely out of my control for 10-20 seconds and then stop. These are new symptoms. I get dull aches in my arm once in a while as well. I also get this very weird sensation in the bottom of my heel that kind of feels like someone is sticking a pin into it, it usually comes while I am laying down. I have also had this new headache and it began about a month after the aforementioned symptoms and about one month ago. Well there are two headaches, the one on the rear left side of my head has been subdued recently but when it was at its ""prime"" it was a sort of sharp pain that would come for about twenty seconds and then go away for a while at random times. Sometimes in would make the whole left side of my head feel weird. With that same headache, when I lay down on the spot or put light pressure on the headache spot it will hurt but not as bad as the headache. The second headache I have only gotten twice and only recently. It is also in the back of my head and a little to the right of the first one. Both times it happened it was after I quickly moved my head to a different position. This was a very intensely sharp headache and one that I would describe as one of the worst I've ever had. Like I said I've only gotten it twice and it goes away after twenty seconds as well. I'm sorry this was so long but if anyone has any idea if these symptoms are related and what they might be please let me know. Thanks.",

Other than the times that I contracted pneumonia and mononucleosis, I have been in good health throughout my entire life. I was raised by a strict vegetarian woman, so I my diet choices are well informed (though I am no longer a vegetarian). I practice cardiovascular exercises and lift weights several times per week. 10 months ago I began using my spare time and money to start my own business. I experienced a 3-month ""honeymoon"" period with this endeavor, after which my anxiety level skyrocketed. My anxiety has stayed at a relatively high level since then. Problem: Starting 4 months ago, a tension headache emerged for the first time in my life. While it does not remain in one particular spot, it seems to only occur on the top and sides of my head. It is not painful, but it is challenging to ignore, and it is affecting me on a socioeconomic level. It feels like there is pressure on my skull. Sometimes it feels hot. On occasion, it feels tingly, almost as if needles were very gently poking my scalp.  The tension headache is never present in the morning. It seems to present itself 10 - 60 mins after I awake. Sometimes its intensity increases throughout the day, and sometimes it remains very dull, but it is always present during my waking hours. Soon after my chronic tension headache began, my left eye began twitching. These twitches occur roughly every 10 minutes and last for a few seconds. The left eye lid often remains tense for minutes at a time, as if it was on the verge of twitching. I visited a chiropractor about these symptoms, and an x-ray showed a slightly misaligned C1 vertebra. The misalignment was so minor, it is hard for me to believe that it is the source of my tension headaches, though that may very well be the case. 2 months ago, I began having involuntary muscle twitches throughout my arms, legs, back, and even strange places, like my inner right ear. These twitches are weak, meaning you wouldn't be able to tell if I was experiencing them unless I pointed them out while they occurred. The twitching happens every 5 - 60 minutes and normally last for 1 - 5 seconds. While writing this, I have a tension headache on the top of my head, closer towards the front (it started on the sides of my head this morning), and my left eye, legs and arms have twitched several times. Note: I have not had an MRI or CT scan done. My philosophy is that I should only do so if I experience cognitive defects, or if the tension headache becomes painful. I am seeing a neurologist next week. Has anyone else experienced these exact symptoms? If so, have you determined the cause? Please feel free to comment with stories, advice, questions, etc.",

Responded quickly to Benadryl and prednisone. I don't know what caused it as it had been 5 hours since eating or drinking anything. I did have a beer and a pseudoephedrine for a cold before bed. Anyways, now months later, I still often have numbness, tingling, and occasionally soreness in the lower part of my face (down cheeks and towards mouth). It hardly ever gets above a 2/10 on a pain scale but it is bothersome. I've considered that it may be psychological (as in I started paying too much attention to normal body variations, because I was worried about having another reaction). And, I've also considered I might be exposing myself in a small way to whatever caused the initial swelling. I do think it's a bit worse for a day or two after drinking a beer, so I've stopped that altogether in case the allergen lies within.

Would this possibly be an auto immune problem?  Thanks !!,

BUT that seems to be the problem area because after a week or so i found i was COVERED with BIG itchy welts that i thought was mosquito bites, after all it was summer and hot and we had the windows open that had no screens.  So i dismissed the bites thinking they were no more than mosquito bites even though they was weird in triangular 3s and not disappearing for days to weeks at times. But i gave birth to my first child around 10 months ago and been told that stuff could happen since pregnancy can change certain things on your bodys reactions. Its winter now, and a week ago i awoke with my face itching like heck, had a bite mark atop my eyebrow, below the same eye on my cheek, and two marks almost diagonal (but really close) on my jawbone. I thought it odd because its been really cold where im at and considering i awoke in the same way i fell asleep and mostly covered im pretty sure theyre not from mosquitoes.  I awoke today with my upper stomach near the breast line itching to find two of those close diagonal welt marks as well as the breast above them having two as well. A few minutes ago i found two on the back upper side of my arm. I kept feeling like i was being crawled over but whenever i looked i never found anything. I had a few people come and check for bedbugs, and the welts dont resemble any scabie marks that i googled. I got scars from the intensely itchy marks along my legs and feet as well as my arms now. Im not sure what to do, i hope i can get some answers here. Can we upload an image? i just signed up so im not familiar with the site yet lol.

I wrote till my non-dominant hand was proficient which took about a month. Until a month ago, I gradually stopped writing with my non-dominant hand. However, I still conducted everyday activities with left (nondominant) hand such as using chopsticks or other utensils. Just recently, my head has been starting to hurt and I don't know if this is due to my training to be ambidextrous or if it is that I do not get enough sleep. Also, the past two days, I have seen that it is a bit more difficult to read than usual. I am able to read fine it is just that I read over some words and occasionally confuse one word with the other. Overall, I am just concerned about whether ambidextrous training can negatively impact my brain and cognition, as I am still in high school. Thank You",

I've always been a ""small person"" and looking back at old class photos and comparing myself to peers (both boys and girls) I was always shorter, and smaller in every aspect (including head size), but it was never an issue because I was always of normal intelligence, and although my head was small so was my body so everything looked proportionate, and in many photos my head even looked too big for my body. However around the start of puberty I finally really began growing, until I soon started getting taller than my peers, and at my current height of about 5'9-5'10 I am about the same height or taller than most of my peers. However one thing stands out and that is my head size. My head went from being slightly too big for my body as a kid, to perfectly fitting my body to now too small for my body. It is currently 21 inches in circumference, which is in fact very small. The back of my head is flat, and my forehead slopes, all characteristics of a microcephalic (although I do have a very similar head shape to my father whom also has the slightly sloping forehead and flat back of the head, his head is way larger and looks perfectly normal). Everyone in my family has a large head. My sister, my brother (23 inches), my mom, my dad, my uncles, my grandfather, aunts, cousins, so I am very confused as to why my head is like this. Around 5th grade my vision started to ""deteriorate"" and I needed glasses and I feel like this is somehow related to my head size. I also have constant 24/7 ringing in my ears. My brother who has large hands and long fingers can grip a good portion of my head and this makes me feel even worst. My hands and body are now way to big compared to my head and I look so disproportional. 2-3 years ago I never got comments on head size and no one ever noticed anything, but ever since high school and puberty the small head is becoming more apparent. I feel like somewhere along the line my head stopped growing like it was supposed to and I have no idea what could have caused this. I also notice my face is very small and shorter in size than all my peers. everyone's heads seem bigger than mine and I wish I could get a diagnosis or something because I am pretty sure that by 16 the head is done growing, and most likely my head circumference will not grow that extra inch or inch and a half that would make is average sized.

Took the cambia again but it didn't help, took Advil,daily nortriptiline, muscle relaxers, more cambia. Called my neurologist after 3 days and they suggested going to the ER to get an infusion. It helped, until I stood up to leave. The headache was immediately back. This continued to go on, kept taking everything listed above. Two weeks into this unbearable headache, I saw my neurologist again, he for some reason checked my eyes and saw that my optic nerve in one eye looked larger and told me to call an opthamologist. I of course did and went to the appointment where he told me could not rule out that it was normal, but it also wasn't abnormal. So I called the neurologist with that, he asked me to come in to the office, thinking I had a pseuodotumor cerebri and wanted to do a spinal tap to check the pressure and take a sample. The opening pressure was 12. They then sent me for another infusion to help with the still unbearable headache. This was on a friday.This is now week three of this crippling headache. Fast forward to Monday, still unable to stand from unbearable presssure in my head, so bad I can't breathe, pulse racing. Call the doctor, they think it's an anuerism, rush to the ER. They run NO tests and speak with my neurologist who says it's from the spinal tap and says to give me an infusion and rest for 48 hours. Rest 48 hours, it's Wednesday and I've now missed 4 days of work and we're heading into week 4 of this headache. I drive to work, last two hours basically laying on the floor because I still can't stand, my legs and face are numb. I attempt to drive home but make it ten minutes before pulling over and calling for help because the pressure in my head is so bad I can't see and I'm nauseous.

What I'm worried about is that I used to drink very heavy 15 years ago but then took a long break and did it sensibly. I stopped 3 years ago to look after my mum. Was fine for 2 years but this last year I've been getting shooting pains up and down the left side of my head. Since diagnosis I've now got tachycardia and nystagmus. Is there a chance wernicke syndrome could be the cause? My neurologist says no but I seem to have all the symptoms. Am very scared. Many thanks.,

I am an 18 year old male in Texas (in case geography plays a role in my condition). I would consider myself pretty healthy and active. I'll be starting college in two days, therefore this reaction is stressing me out. This is the first time any of this is happening to me. I woke up two days ago with a big swollen upper lip. It didn't hurt. It was difficult to eat and talk. I took two pills of Benadryl, causing the lower lip to calm down a bit. I kept taking Benadryl yesterday as well. This morning when I woke up, my legs, arms, and abdomen had skin-colored raised bumps. A few of them disappeared after a couple of hours and after a few more pills of Benadryl. But then they came back in different locations. They aren't painful, just itchy. Also, my lower lip is twice its regular size. The lower lips still hasn't gone back to normal and the bumps are still on my skin. I haven't eaten anything new or out of the ordinary. I don't want to spend too much money on a doctor if this is a condition that would go away on its own. Does anyone have any suggestions or tips? Thank you very much.",Hives

I am a 36-year-old female with multiple food allergies and a history of seasonal allergies and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Since roughly November, 2016, I started noticing that I would randomly become very itchy. The itching starts at maybe my foot/leg, ears or arms/hands and spread throughout the day to my torso, back and basically any other part of the body you can think of. If I take loratidine OTC 5 mg., this will calm the itching temporarily. Within 48 hours of taking the pill, the itching returns. My allergist originally diagnosed me with dermatographia, but the itching seems to begin regardless of whether or not I have been touched, scraped or bumped by anything. It will occur randomly, as I sit at my desk at work, or watching tv. But it will also occur if I'm exercising. There is usually no rash, except for bumps that come from my harsh scratching response, and I usually bruise myself from scratching so much and so hard. I suppose I could take loratidine every day, but I want to get to the root of what is causing this maddening itch in the first place. Does this sound like anything anyone has heard of before? This is an entirely new symptom for me, and doesn't seem to have come at the normal time of my seasonal allergies (started in November). Any advice/help is appreciated, so I can bring this concern to my allergist in September. Thank you!!",

I've had pain in the same region before after sleeping on an air mattress but it would disappear within 2 weeks. i exercise on the regular, so in this case i've stopped all lower body workouts immediately. this time it hasn't dissipated and i went to a local orthopedist, who took an xray, said theres no bone damage, and prescribed diclofenac. the same day, in fact right as i was leaving his office, i started feeling nauseous, so i stopped taking diclofenac. it was barely noticeable in the beginning, but would get worse everyday, appetite disappearing. first time i went to my family doctor i was told it probably is food poisoning because there was no fever. standard blood test came back normal. in addition, i had pretty much constant intestinal movement, gases, and diarrhea for 1 day, no abdominal pain. the following day fever started, i had no appetite at all, and i was getting heavy night sweats and one night i was restless and fainted. i had emt over and their conclusion was stomach flu and malnourishment/dehydration. i went back to my doctor the following morning, and he pretty much said the same and prescribed substances with electrolytes. eventually i got a lot better and returned to work. left hip was still hurting on and off, but i never got to follow up since i was completely sick. i lasted two day at the office until same symptoms returned, now with dizziness. on my way home from work, i started feeling numbness in my hands, dizziness, near fainting sensation. went back to the doctor the same day, he took blood for a more in depth blood test (including blood cell content/count i believe) and it came back fine as well. i stayed home for another week and a half, through which i went through regular flu (what i was told) and a sinus infection (bright yellow mucus, jaw, ear, and head aches), but still experienced abdominal discomfort, slight nausea, and loss of appetite. also experienced discomfort in colon/anus/prostate, had to pinpoint. i was on antibiotics for the infection and acetaminophen, but reasonable daily doses. while i was on sick leave, i went to a few follow up appointments, including a cardiologist, internal organ sonogram, and lower back MRI. i had cardiogram and heart sonogram done, as well as wore a monitor for 24 hours, and everything showed up normal. organ sonogram (liver, kidneys, pancreas, etc.) was normal. lower back MRI showed 2 herniated disks, which can explain lower back and hip pain (i have another followup appointment for this tomorrow). also had an endoscopy procedure which revealed two minor ulcers and samples were taken. whole last week was pretty much fine, aside from some abdominal discomfort, barely noticeable or no nausea, good appetite, no dizziness, but still constant intestinal movement and gases, no abdominal pain. today at work i started feeling dizzy with chills again, this time conscious but feeling some loss of balance (some sort of vertigo without heights). experiencing some abdominal and colon discomfort also barely noticeable jaw/ear pain. i also seem to have occasional stiff neck that forces me to rotate my head and a tender point right side of neck/trap muscle that gets sore and tingly. also seldom triceps and quad ache and buttocks gets sore from extended sitting on hard surfaces (another tender point?).  i have so many symptoms that its hard to pinpoint whats going on, as well as hard to tell if theyre related or not. they seem to come and go in cycles. i want additionally check my intestine, colon, maybe prostate, neck, whats the best method? want to schedule an appointment with a neurologist. what else should be done? please advise on stenosis, infections (h pylori, staph, etc. - im an engineer in wastewater treatment), fibromyalgia, tumors... want to mention that ive had lower back problems my whole life, both parents have similar issues, so its genetic. sometimes experience numbness in limbs during sleep (another reason to visit a neurologist). also lost about 10-12 lbs since stopped exercising and eating properly, but i was bulking so this weight loss is normal.",

However, for about that past few weeks I began to have a strange tingling, pressure coming from between my eyes that would occur during meditation. Reading into it I was able to deduce that it was a natural side effect of deep meditation for some and thought nothing of it. However, for about the last week that sensation has stayed with me, even when not meditating all throughout the day (although much more pronounced during from the early afternoon until bed). It’s become bothersome, and I have stopped meditating thinking it will only make things worse. Is there anything that can be done to make this stop? I’m sure thinking about it doesn’t help, but I fear I’ve opened up some new neural pathway in my prefrontal cortex that causes this incessant (it’s turns on and off frequently) that can’t be shut down. I don’t think it warrants getting going to a doctor—I’ve seen this is quite common amongst people who meditate. However, I see it isn’t quite common to have it become a lasting issue outside of meditation. I hope you have some explanation or advice.",

I handed it to her and the next thing I remember being in a sleep like state with my wife trying to calm me down telling me it's alright and to let the EMT's do what they need to do. I remember feeling like I was having a nightmare and being frightened like I've never been frightened before. From the time I handed the dish to my wife and the time I came out of the seizure. So, jump back 1 1/2 years. My doctor switched me from Enbrel to Humira for psoriatic arthritis/psoriasis. Over the course of that year and a half I was slowly becoming more lethargic, lacking energy and feeling more and more depressed to the point that I didn't want to do anything or go anywhere. In addition to the Humira I had also been on Tramadol 50mg every 4-6 hours as needed for pain and 2 weeks prior to the seizure I went to see my GP about how I'd been feeling. He had me taken a test for depression on a tablet and even though I tested on the low end for depression he decided to prescribe Prozac 20mg once daily. If that didn't help he was going to see me again. Immediately after the seizure I stopped the Humira and Prozac because of some things I'd read online. A week after the seizure I had my first appointment with a neurologist and she agreed with us on stopping the Humira and Prozac and diagnosed it as a ""provoked"" seizure and ordered an E.E.G. Once I had the E.E.G. she said she saw ""sharp"" waves and put me on Levetiracetam 750mg twice daily which leaves me feeling a little cloudy (btw, the E.R. doc put me on Phenytoin Sodium 100mg once daily which left me feeling like crap) and I hate it. I am self employed and since this all started I've been double & triple checking my work. Anyway, between the time I had the E.E.G. and the follow up with the neuro doc my rheumatologist said the Tramadol could have also contributed to the seizure so I stopped taking that and now manage my pain with OTC medication, mostly Tylenol. At the E.E.G. follow up I asked the doctor if I should have another E.E.G. now that I was off the Tramadol and her response was ""there's no point"" and refused to order another one. Does this sound right? We live in Austin, TX and it's looking like I'll have to find a neuro in another metro area like Dallas to find a good neuro for a second opinion and before I start jumping through the hoops for that I thought I'd get a little input from others who may have suffered a similar situation. Thanks in advance for any input and advice! (Told you it would be long!) LOL!",

So, I attempted to execute a tackle while running at high speed, and I did not do it correctly. The left side of my skull, just above my temple, hit the player's lower thigh/upper knee, and I heard a large popping sound. After I tackled the player, my neck began to hurt severely, and I could not turn my head even the slightest amount to the right or left without excruciating pain to the upper left and right side of my neck. My head, which took the blow did not hurt and has not since the incident, and my neck has gotten slightly better with some stretching and rest, but I feel cloudy, and I am wondering if I got a concussion. Should I go see a doctor? Thank you, anonymous",

We figured it was an allergic reaction considering what he comes in contact with on a daily (bugs, chemicals, etc). It gradually got worse, even with applications of cortizone, benedryl, and even tried aloe vera gel. The rash itches on a torturous level. Not contagious because it would have spread to me by now. A few days ago, his breathing started getting labored, wheezing coughing fits keeping him up at night (he hasn't had a peaceful night sleep in a week. He's coughing up weird consistency, kind of gritty pasty, phelgm, sort of beige color and he said it's a weird taste (not something he could pinpoint but not the usual taste of mucus). We finally broke down and went to the doctor, they brushed off his labored breathing, weird phlegm and coughing fits as a cold. They gave us prednisone for the the rash. Doctors visit cost $200 which we don't have and we can't go back. Rash has gone down, less red, still itches. We've continued applications of benedryl (pill and cream) and cortizone and aloe vera gel. He said he felt better throughout the day yesterday, but in the evening it was like he had reverted back to mass coughing fits, woke up through the night as well wiht mass coughing fits and wheezing. Tomorrow is his last day of the prednisone, rash is still not completely gone. It kills me to watch him suffer like this and be powerless to do anything, we can't afford another doctor's visit. Please tell me someone can shed some light on this. We have changed nothing in the house (detergents, etc), we do have a flea problem but it's been there for a while and we're waiting for some new treatment for the cats to come in.

A month or two later I was referred to a rheumatologist and diagnosed with HLA B27, and later rheumatoid arthritis.  Roughly 6 months later I was referred to a neurologist for involuntary hand movements and face movements, daytime sleepiness (I can't control my sleep schedule), being drowsy and overall feeling down.  I noticed my underwear was wet all the time, and realized I was leaking pee throughout the day, but I don't notice it. I also drip for a few minutes after I use the restroom.  I told the neurologist this, but they told me it may be a urinary tract infection, but I don't have any pain down there. And it still happens to this day, almost a year after my last visit.  The neurologist had me take a seizure test, they attached wires to my head for 12 hours and every few hours they flashed lights for about a minute, and had me hyperventilate. They came to the conclusion I was not having seizures.  They scheduled an appointment for 3 months later, and then canceled. And I haven't been back since.  Now for what's happening now. I'm still experiencing joint and muscle pain, as of recently the involuntary hand movement has come back, I still can't control my sleep schedule, and I still drip and leak urine.

Allergies,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/allergies/10920/cellulitis---heat-or-cold-can-t-find-a-straight-answer,"Cellulitis - Heat or Cold, can't find a straight answer?","Sorry couldn't find an appropriate category for discussing infections and this seemed most appropriate among the available categories. Question:  While taking antibiotics and keeping the infected area elevated, is it best to accompany it with heat or cold compress to the affected area? Should we just leave it alone? We've been told conflicting answers between 2 visits to the ER and can't find anything definitive on the web. History: My wife was given a Tetanus shot 4 days ago and within 24 hours began to experience a lot of swelling and discomfort. We went back to the Dr's office and was told by a nurse that this is an allergic reaction to the compounds in the tetanus shot and happens from time to time. She suggested icing it and drew a line around the swollen/red area. 24hrs later, it spread about an inch past the line so we went to the ER. They told us this is not an allergic reaction but a staff infection due to poor treatment or preparation of the injection. Sounds like a professional way to say dirty needle to me but I could be wrong. They gave another antibiotic treatment via shot to help kick the keflex in faster and again said to keep close eye on the site and return if it worsens. They also said to use cold compress on it. 24hrs later, it has seemed to subside then return very angry and we went back to ER, this time was told Keflex was not a good choicde considering my wife's background with her auto-immune diseases and prescribed Doxycycline and said no, never use ice on infection and instead use heat to bring more white blood cells to the infected area. I've searched and searched online and so far have only found a few mentions of applying heat to cellulitis, mostly in bodybuilding, derma/skin health type forums but nothing that would tell me that applying heat to cellulitis is indeed the proper accompanying treatment while taking antibiotics. I don't want to make a bad situation worse if heat is not good, as of now we are just leaving it alone, no heat, no cold. If anyone can point me to where I can find the answer definitively it would be greatly appreciated. TY",
Brain & Nervous System Disorders,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/1792/what-may-be-causing-my-wide-ranging-neurological-symptoms,What may be causing my wide-ranging neurological symptoms?,"Four years ago I started experiencing some strange symptoms - pain in kidney region, tightness in chest, and wide ranging neurological symptoms in all limbs. There were also 4 instances of having full body cramp that would come on rapidly and last 5 to 10 minutes - completely tight chest, pursed lips, full cramp in hands and calf muscles.  These symptoms resolved themselves in 3 months or so, but since then the symptoms have returned periodically (every 6 - 9 months) - but never as bad as I reminder the first instances in 2012. Over the past two weeks they have returned. Below is a breakdown of what I am feeling: - Muscle Twitching: constant and random across both sides bottom of foot, thigh muscles , groin, buttocks, upper arm, eyelids - Pins & Needles / Burning Sensation / Itching: random as above, itching extending to chest, back, and scalp. Nothing overwhelming, just annoying and I'm aware of it.  - Numbness: twice I've experienced arm numbness, but more common in area around mouth / jaw / cheeks - Pain: occasional shooting pain in right kidney, left chest below the breakbone, and eyes ... again not overwhelming, but definitely aware of it  I have some mild fatigue, but no loss of balance / coordination, no difficulty breathing or sleeping, no difficulties speaking. I am physically active and do not notice the symptoms when I am playing sport.  I have seen three doctors between 2012 - 2014, with no firm diagnosis. Negative tests for HIV and diabetes, all clear on ECGs, no lesions showing on an MRI. In their view, this ruled out the most severe neurological diseases and I figure anything like MS / ALS would have manifested more strongly by now.  The only theories of note (completely uninformed and not made my doctors) are some kind of seafood reaction, a reaction to two surgeries I had just prior to symptoms starting (knee reconstruction and oral implants), or some kind of virus.  All of the above, I'm stuck for ideas and can go to a new doctor but worry it may yield the same result. Appreciate any ideas a wider forum may have!",

Anti-depressants thus far have made me aggressive, given me gut rot or are just not hitting the mark. Alprazolam is at a minimal daily dosage and not helping either.

Brain & Nervous System Disorders,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/1857/undiagnosed-concussion-s,Undiagnosed Concussion(s),"I have, for well over 25 yrs, been misdiagnosed as having psychological/mental illnesses. But last week I found out that all this time it has been because I suffered at least one concussion as a very young child and it is believed that I suffered many more concussions throughout my life. I struggled in school. Flunked second grade and I graduated with a D average. While everyone else(I have a huge family) had straight A's. even in college. And the ones you skipped school and partied still got A's and B's without even trying. And now I suffer long term affects of having at least one concussion. Depression, anxiety(all kinds now), I've been diagnosed or should I say misdiagnosed with psychological/mental disorders-disabilities. You have to see a specialist that specializes in concussions. Tests that regular Drs run aren't the right ones. In today's world, they now have specialty tests to diagnose concussions. MRI's specific for concussions for example. Without seeing the proper specialist in concussions, Drs don't perform the specific tests for diagnosing concussions. So you are always sent to the psych Drs. And they assume you have a mental disorder. And are treated as such all the while you get worse. You may feel better for a while but then boom, meds don't work anymore, you've already progressed into the now long term side affects from your concussion(s). For me, there's no fixing the damage now. But they can try and relieve some symptoms and try to slow down the progression. But I'm only 48 yrs old. Been completely disabled since I was 40 yrs old. Now I can't function. Here is a small portion of symptoms... Headaches; Feelings of Dizziness; Nausea and/or Vomiting; Noise Sensitivity, easily upset by loud noise; Sleep Disturbance; Fatigue, tiring more easily; Being Irritable, easily angered; Feeling Depressed or Tearful; Feeling Frustrated or Impatient; Forgetfulness, poor memory; Poor Concentration; Taking Longer to Think; Blurred Vision; Light Sensitivity, Easily upset by bright light; Double Vision; Restlessness  If you have three or more of just these symptoms, immediately go see a concussion specialist. The early diagnosis the more chance of full recovery, or better odds to fix a lot of the symptoms. Please remember, this is just the basics of symptoms. The more advanced/longer wait time to see a concussion specialist, the worse you will get. Believe me. I can't comprehend anything I read now. It used to be it was a huge problem but I'd at least get the concept. My anxiety is through the roof. I can't do anything by myself even though I have no one to help me. So that's my living nightmare. You develop compulsive behaviors; you do stuff without understanding the negative consequences. Like law breaking stuff; stealing, unsafe sexual behavior; sleeping around, prostitution, etc, fights, your behavior or your old self is no more.  Please read up on the brain and each section of the brain and what each sections job is. And it's all neurological. So you will also have physical problems of many kinds and areas. Remember this...the age you were at time of concussion(s), the severity of each concussion(s), what location(s) it affected the brain, and how many concussions you have had throughout your life.  You do not have to be unconscious ever to have endured a concussion(s). Almost all Drs still believe that, unfortunately. Yes, the majority of people recover from concussions, but the ones that don't...90 something percent of those people are misdiagnosed as psychological/mental illness/disease. And never get better for long. There are no meds to treat people with concussions. If you are sent to the mental side of Drs they will treat your depression if that arises or your anxiety but the meds will stop working if they even did to begin with. War veterans are treated for PTSD because yes that's a symptom but most of them if not all veterans have had at least one concussion. So they are being treated by the wrong Drs. You can sustain a concussion especially as a child from physical abuse; falls; car accident(s), numerous of things people don't think about. Please y'all do yourself a favor and do your research. Use current like 2016 reading material, books, cuz they have medical tests now that can confirm concussions. YOU have to tell your Dr the right tests. They won't automatically do them. Mostly cuz they are unaware.",

So growing up I was told it was most likely brought on because of such drastic hormone changes...  I'm 28 now and I just got my official diagnosis... Turns out the moment the attending physician saw me. For the 7 day EEG study she said she knew I was born with it. Beucase of my birth mark above my left eye.

When I was in highschool, I was 11 or 12, I suffered z seizure that knocked me uncounscious for 30 seconds. I basically increased my head pressure to my head by forcing it to show my classmates how I can “turn red”. That basically affected the oxygen that went to my brain and I fell to the floor, having a seizure for 30 seconds (that’s what my classmates said). After I woke up I didn’t feel the same. I had not been really smart or anything and my grades stayed the same, but I just didn’t feel myself. I don’t know where my head was when I hit the floor. I didn’t tell my parents, I’m now 17. I also have myopia on both eyes, which started around highschool but can’t remember when exactly. My left eye is worse than my right eye. I’ve been feeling perfectly well, I didn’t really see any big changes in my personality, and I’ve never been social. I have extreme social anxiety and I’m seeing a psychologist. My family is not very social and has problems, and I attribute my anxiety due to that fact. About 6 months ago I’m having a really small bump under my skin and above my skull on the left side of my head on the occipital lobe and I don’t know what it is. It’s really small and sometimes it’s “suddenly” itchy or painful I’m not certain if it feels hard or soft. When I shake my head quickly I can feel a shooting and small pain on the left side of my brain (a large potion of it) which I don’t feel on the other side, but I feel it inside my head. It might be due to stress because I have been extremely anxious and stressed to the point that I couldn’t sleep well, that was due to an urinary tract infection that I had over the last month and having it for so long made me anxious. I’m treating it with macrodantine and hiprex for 10 days, I’m on the 5th day. Having said that, there are times when I am anxious or taking to a girl for example that I start to sweat on the right side of my head. Sometimes I feel jerks on any part of the body, but they are really occasional and I think they are caused because of the anxiety making my muscles too tense, because when I get home to sleep sometimes I have night tremors. I should also add that I’m a bit hypochondriac and I had an ecg done because I thought I had heart problems but I overreacted. I’m not sure if I’m overreacting now",Epilepsy/Seizures

I treat the area with Locoid 0.1%, Hydro cortisone 17-butyrate 1 mg/mL, Scalp Lotion. This stings a bit initially but then soothes the skin.

For quite some time now I've been concerned about driving the Ford during the winter when I have to keep the windows closed in order to keep warm. My concern is carbon monoxide (C0). One of my co-workers has a meter which measures CO in the air. I asked him if I could borrow it to test what sort of emissions are in my car. After testing it I found that it had 56 ppm of CO. This was after driving my Ford for 20 minutes. My co-worker gave me a link to a CDC web page for safe CO emissions:     According to this I'm getting more than what's allowed for a 24 hour period of time. So I've GOT to do something, but like I said I cannot afford to replace nor repair it. So is there anything like a mask I could wear which will filter out the CO?",

It started with extreme itching all over my legs. Later, I am itchy pretty much everywhere. I never had any sign of a rash, or allergic reaction. Sometimes I would wake up in the middle of the night from scratching.( I have no known allergies )  First Steps:  Doctor: I first started by changing the detergent I was using. Then, I went to the doctor who ran blood tests, stool samples, urine tests, and everything came back normal. In the mean time, she suggested I take an anti-histamine for relief and sent me off to get an allergy test. I went to get a full comprehensive allergy test - everything came back normal. However, I hadn't stopped taking the anti-histamine as I was not advised to so I am unsure if it could have been a false test as a result. She then referred me to a dermatologist Dermatologist: I went to the dermatologist, and after describing my symptoms, he did not inspect my skin, but he advised that I do a scabies treatment. (Neither my partner nor I have any signs of scabies and we live together ) I went ahead and did the treatment regardless. Itching persisted. I went back for a follow up, and he suggested that I do it again - out of frustration I asked him, if it wasn't scabies what we would be trying next and he said we would start blood tests etc over. Needless to say I did not go back to him. Doctor: I went back to the doctor to explain my frustrations, and hope for an alternative solution to my problem. She prescribed me steroid creams to try, but it was difficult as the itching was not localized. She advised that this could be something environmental that I never find out - which wasn't something I was willing to accept. This condition has been making me extremely irritable and has begun to affect my professional and personal life. Naturopath: At this point, I've turned to a naturopath. Over the last 6 months, I feel like we have tried almost everything. She reviewed my blood work, and did a new stool sample to rule out parisites. My symptoms now include: itching everywhere, including the bottoms of my feet until they peel and get hot. Itching my legs until they scab. Dry stinging chest, itchy eyes. Painful sweating and itching in areas where there is pressure from clothing ie; waistband, bra straps. Clamy hot skin waist band, bra, underwear lines. More comfortable in loose fitting clothes. Sensitive skin to the point where any fabric ( sheets on my bed included ) touches me, and its almost a painful sensation, prickly burning. This is a list of the following things we have done to try and treat the condition: 1. Mastocytosis Disease - low histamine diet & Stinging Nettle Tea, Quercetin SAP. 2. Low histamine diet, B12 injections, & NAC SAP Antioxidant, Cyto-Calm to help with my sleepless nights. 3. Liver Cleanse - Live SAP & Chelidonium Plex drops 4. Parasite Cleanse - Garlic Activated Principles, Berber, Black Walnut, OIl of Oregano 5. Going off birth control (Nueva Ring) - I was on Yasmine from age 16 - 20, went on Seasonale for about 1 year - went off the pill for 4 months - went back on to yasmine for about 1 year - swtiched to Nueva Ring, on it for approx. 6months) She has given me Femco & Chaste tree to help with the symptoms.  I have been off the Nueva ring for about 1.5 months now. I got my first period normal timing. Since then, my symptoms have increased, and I have scabs all over my shins, now starting to my thighs from itching my skin so hard. Symptoms seem to be worse with clothing on. At work I get hot flash symptoms. I have been consistently waking up at 3am and having trouble falling asleep for the last 3-4 months now. Often wake up in a cold sweat. When I exercise, and sweat my scalp becomes incredibly itchy almost stinging sensation.  My libido is non-existant, and the irritability from itching doesn't help.

Once I discovered what was causing it I cut out all sources of vitamin D I could (stopped taking the supplements, stayed out of the sun, avoided D-rich foods) for about nine months and it went away entirely. I've read that most D allergies are only reactions to supplements and not naturally occurring D like from the sun or in foods, so I recently started re-introducing some D-rich foods and a bit of sun back into my life. Within days I got noticeably itchy again. I'm at the point where if I spend a day in the sun or drink a glass of milk I have noticeable symptoms by the next day. I'm worried about the long-term health ramifications of cutting as much D as possible from my life. I know it's a pretty important vitamin. I don't really know how to find a balance between being so itchy it distracts me from everyday life, and being so deficient I do my body long-term damage. Any advice or insight would be appreciated. My doc had never heard of an allergy of this sort, so I'm pretty lost. (Before someone suggests magnesium, I tried it and it also cause the eczema to flair. Not sure what that indicates.)",Living & Managing

I felt it go down my entire face and neck to my chest and stop. It felt like I had a terrible fever but only in my head, not my body.

ADD/ADHD,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/4067/eyes-are-still-hella-dilated-from-the-adderall-high-now-they-re-red-af,Eyes are STILL hella dilated from the adderall high. Now they're red af?,"So i got this ""friend"" who has been prescribed 20mg adderall ir tablets, once a day at noon ever since starting high school (though he doesn't take it everyday, just when he needs to). This friend decided to try and get high off his adderall, since hes smoked weed before many times. He took 3 tablets and crushed them up and snorted the first then the other two by halves, every 1/2 hour, to make sure he didn't take too much (he ain't THAT dumb). The thing is he didn't really feel all that high, he was still pretty much completely functional, he just felt kinda euphoric but only a very tiny tiny bit. he just knew it was time to stop because his eyes were dilated like hell. He didn't sleep that night. Then yesterday. He woke up perfectly fine, pupils where back to normal too. Then around 2 in the afternoon he had an anxiety attack. He hasn't had an anxiety attack, or even really anxiety that much (except for like tests and stuff but that's normal, right?), since junior year high school and he's a freshman in college rn which is why he stopped taking his lamotragine when the anxiety stopped and why he didn't think to bring it with me to college. But, he was in his room and his roommate (who's been a close friend since elementary school) too. His roommate helped him. Actually walking outside helped a lot. But he still had anxiety, just not severe, just constant and relentless. His heart wouldn't slow down even though he seemed calm. Finally his heart slowed down but he was still feeling a lot of anxiety. He decided to snort more adderall like the other night, like a giant idiot (which he now realizes), but his anxiety stopped and he seemed fine except for the hugely dilated pupils, which weren't too too noticeable. Then last night he noticed his eyes were getting red in the corners. Like real read. It didn't seem to be spreading so he went to bed. Didn't sleep though again. Then comes this morning where his eyes are not super red but pretty red on the outer side only of each eye and in the inside of the lower eyelid. Also his pupils were still dilated. Since he didn't have dilated pupils still the morning after that first night, he figure somethings wrong because he took the same amount of adderall as last time, 60mg total. So he looked up if adderall can do stuff to the eyes. Apparently, snorting adderall can damage the eyes. Sh*t. He also finds out that redness of the eyes and dilated pupils along with darkening around the eyes can mean chemical damage to the eyes. But it could aslo mean the adderall is still in his system for whatever reason and his eyes are bloodshot because of the insomnia. He freaked the f*ck out because around his eyes had always been slightly dark so he could tell if that was a symptom or not. He took an emergen-c, because he knows vitamin c in high doses can get help stop and get rid of the adderall still in your system quick, thus possibly avoiding continued eye damage if there was ever any. He swore to himself never to get high on adderall again and he asked his roommate to hold onto his adderall to make sure he definitely wont, even to stop the expected anxiety attack if this today is to follow the same schedule as yesterday. Now he is waiting to see if the pupils will shrink, but hes kinda obsessing rn just waiting and he doesnt want to call his parents to ask them to drop off the lamotragine because they would probably ask what happened and start getting worried since he hasn't had an attack in almost 2 years. Plus his pupils are f*cking moons and his parents would notice. Is there anything else he could to to help with the seemingly inevitable anxiety attack and do you think he should see a doctor about the eyes right away or wait to see if the pupils shrink, because he has no discomfort when moving his eyes, another common symptom of chemical eye damage, they just feel tired which is reasonable from being up 60 hours straight and still counting cuz it's day. What does he do? He's kinda sorta panicking rn which is starting to cause some anxiety.  PS: He doesn't feel high in the slightest even though his pupils are dilated.","Symptoms , Treatment & Care , Diagnosis , ADHD in Adults"

Since then, I've been having slight headaches from time to time on my left side and sometimes my right, but never both; my face gets warm and it hurts a bit behind my eye, but the pain is far from debilitating, just very worrying. The headaches are fairly rare and go away after some time and advil.

I've also noticed that sometimes the sight in one of my eyes is less sharp than the other, though not enough to tell unless I check them separately and sometimes one eye seems a bit more dilated than the other but they always respond to light and when parts of my body fall asleep, they always come back with use.

I was near fainting after that as i wall already exhausted but I didn't. Then I felt okay. The next day at night, I had a simple seizure. Just trembling and change of taste and a small fever that disappeared overnight. I had diarrhoea and swollen lymph node in abdomen that healed after I went to a doctor who treated my condition as a viral gastritis. That day I also ate something from outside so maybe that was it. Then everything was okay though I felt pressure in middle of head. Where i hit the ball. Then after 3 days, I had chills/trembling at night. This went on for 5 days then healed. I was all ok. After 3 weeks of being normal, i started to have chest tightness that increased till my left arm went numb in a specific position. It became sharp overnight. But when I raised my arm over my head, it sort of went away. Also when i lied down, the pain came back.Doctor treated it as muscular cus my ECG was perfectly normal. Infact, healthy athletic cus I am 16. Then I was normal again. One night, I woke up with sharp pain in head middle. I was alright but i felt pressure again. Then i became normal. After 20 days, i had head aches, head pressure, cold feeling on one side but headaches were dull, throbbing and went and came. Went and came. I still have chest ache, its in centre and a little left. But i don't have breathlessness or anything now. These symptoms disappear then come. Neither do i faint now, but i hear voices like ticking or clicking inside head when i run or shake it.

But i am confused and the pressure comes and causes me to feel bad. No MRI as now i am a teenager and its damaging. The doctor did some tests of blood and urine and everything came normal.

It turns out the room did have a lot of mold, the room had a sump tank inside of it which I did not know, and the room eventually had a sewer backup that was discovered shortly after I had to go to the emergency room for bleeding from my ear. I believe some stuff was transferred to my house when I brought equipment home from work to continue to work while on medical leave. The house also had some crazy issues. dad said it had a lot of building errors, issues with drainage going the wrong direction from like the water hose and the bathroom. my old neighbor told me that there were people in the house with hazmat suits on, but no one will tell me why and my unit would not test the basement when my doctor asked so he could know how to treat me.""

I also have 2 lesions in my mouth.  Yes, ma'am. I also get these severe muscle cramps now all over my entire body at once. I'm talking shins neck face stomach legs. Downright debilitating. With all the symptoms I had, they thought I had MS, they thought I had rare cancers, they thought I had hereditary angioedema, I've been tested for muscular dystrophy, Lyme disease alpha-gal, you name it. Simple allergies were ruled out when they had to admit me on several occasions because they thought it was allergies but epipens, benadryl and sreroids are not working.  I've seen a urologist, nephrologist, orantologist, immunologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist, neurologist, gastroenterologist, and now pulmonary specialist as well. The reason why so many doctors is because whatever is going on with doing so much crazy stuff to my body that it resembled a lot of things but it turned out it wasn't those things. I now have a delayed swallow, I choke on food and liquids a lot. I keep getting constant bacterial infections and for some reason all the doctors find it hard to believe that I'm celibate and have been for 5 years, I have a lung function test next month, I also have a test to measure how much force is in my esophagus.

Pain was also felt while taking support from right hand or while doing pushups. Right shoulder joint and muscles also appear less developed or strong than the left side shoulder joint and muscles. Same symptoms of shrinking and weakness appeared gradually in right hip and right jaw making it difficult to sit and lie down comfortably and chew hard items.

Neurofeedback is a relatively new biofeedback technique that focuses on helping a person train themselves to directly affect brain function. Although it sounds like science-fiction in nature, it’s actually a reputable and scientifically-proven technique practiced by specially-trained psychotherapists. Neurofeedback, also known as EEG biofeedback, is a gradual therapeutic learning process that takes time and focus. As the name implies, Neurofeedback works by providing feedback to an individual about their brain, specifically, their brainwaves. Feedback in a vacuum, however, is useless, so the individual undergoing Neurofeedback is rewarded for patterns of brainwave activity that are better for the person. This is referred to as “self-regulation,” because the individual is learning how to regulate their own actual brainwave patterns on their own, without medications or additional therapy. Biofeedback is a very unique process. It is not based on the conventional medical model, which is to diagnose and treat diseases and symptoms. Biofeedback works because it is based on a model of wholism.",

The only thing that has been even remotely helping the extreme amount of mucus that chokes me is Mucinex D, but I've been becoming light headed and fatigued since I've been taking it regularly, but again, it's the only thing that helps.

I have been taking zoloft for two years. I normally take my Zoloft at night and my vyvanse in the morning. I forgot to take it last night so I did as I usually do and took it as soon as I remembered today. The first two days when I took my Zoloft at night I had no problems. Today how ever, I became very disoriented, had a racing heart and tremors after taking them at the same time in the morning. My dr told me to take my Zoloft at night and vyvanse in the morning from now on. My question is has anyone else ever had this happen?

Didn't know which category this fits into. When I talk with the phone pressed up to my left ear, everyone can hear me fine. When I move it to the right side, I cut out terribly. I even analyzed how I held the phone with each hand to make sure I wasn't holding it funny. It's so bad that my husband now just says ""switch sides"" when talking to me bc it's cutting out and he knows it's on the right side. The signal instantly clears up when I switch to the left side. I have also noted that when I listen to audiobooks with earbuds in (which isn't very often) it's always a little muffled sounding on the right side but I haven't noticed any hearing loss on the right side.  Any ideas as to what could cause this? Is it something I should get looked at or just call it a strange phenomenon and not worry about it. I had a great aunt who couldn't wear wrist watches on one side bc they'd always stop. Maybe it's some strange hereditary thing I picked up.",

I think he mumbles, but I could be wrong. Anyway, he'll say something to me and I'll only register a few key words of his sentence. He gets very annoyed with me because he has to repeat himself, after I ask what. I then get nervous & don't want to ask the dreaded ""what"", so my brain instantly starts trying figure out or guess at what he might want, by the words I did get. Which is never successful. Sometimes, even when I'm trying to listen, after he's repeating himself, the words don't register & I just have to tell him that I don't know what he's saying. Other times he'll tell me things after I leave the room. I come back to ask ""wha""t & he's mad. I don't understand why he does that. He's gotta know that if I have trouble following what he says when I'm right next to him, I'm not gonna hear what he says when I'm not in the room. This doesn't occur all the time.

Or I will repeadiatly ask the same question over and over not remembering asking it or ever receiving an answer. My memory is consistently getting worse. The second thing is that every once and a while I will feel a numbness in the back of my head almost like the back of my head fell asleep. My hands fall asleep while im sleeping but also my arms and legs will get all tingly on and off through out the day. The third thing is my vision gets blurry but it almost feels like my blood pressure is going up at those moments and my eyes kinda burn. Those things I can deal with. But with the past year or so I have had some emotional/mood issues. Crying all the time or getting overly anger. Which I have really been working hard to get through. The worst of it that makes me really worry the most is what has been happening within the past 6 months and is getting more consistent is that I have been mixing up my letters and numbers.. for instance when I look at an ""a"" I will say 80. Today a customer wanted to know the weight of his motor oil. I kept saying it was fw-20 preferred but fw-30 would work too. I said it like 5 or 6 times and they were not understanding me and my boss said it was 5w-20 preferred but it could take 5w-30. They understood him and said oh ok. I started thinking about it and was wondering if I was saying ""f"" instead of 5 so later I asked him about it and I asked if I was saying ""fw"" and he said yes and he was trying to figure out what the hell I was saying. I really thought that I was saying 5 all of those times and in my head I was saying 5 but out loud I was saying ""f"". Also I was writing on the delivery driver board because we have to write on it where we are going to make a delivery. I went to go write vaughn on it but when I got to the ""n"" I wrote it upside down. Not a ""u"" But an upside down ""n"" like it was a mirror image.

When the weather turned warm, the first bite swelled horribly, and all of them itched like crazy, so I went to the doctor. He said it looked like an allergy and gave me some steroid cream, which didn't help at all. Then he sent me to a dermatologist, who agreed it looked like an allergy but put me on doxycycline due to the known tick bite and took a biopsy. About an hour after I took the doxycycline, the itching drastically reduced. Unfortunately the medicine gave me such severe heartburn that I was only able to take it a few days. The biopsy results confirmed it was just an allergy, so she put me on a stronger steroid cream, and that one does seem to be doing the trick. The bites seem to be continuing to shrink.

The 2nd (about 2 years later) told me he didn't believe in that dx. The 3rd (approximately 1&1/2 years ago) told me we would address it later. The 3rd Dr was part of the same network of Drs the 1st is part of. When I went in for a second visit with Dr3 I spoke with them about getting testing done. There were 0 notes on my chart even noting that I felt this needs to be addressed. How does one get treatment it they cant get tested? And how does one get tested if no one will even discuss it with me, much less write orders for the testing? It is SO frustrating and has seriously ruined the trust I have in medical doctors. My mother was a life long educator and says that while ADD wasn't something that was even a ""thing"" when I was growing up, theres no doubt in her mind that I was the poster child for it.  If this is standard treatment of Drs towards patients then I can pinpoint where a lot of our heroin and drug problems stem from. If a Dr won't take care of a problem people will self medicate.

Now here's my situation: I'm an non-sedentary 20 year old male that have had rhinitis as far as I can remember, it's never been a huge problem and more of an annoyance. I also have a sleep problem where I always felt tired, sluggish, lacking concentration and disposition throughout the day while sleeping 7-10 hours every night and after recently moving to another house which didn't have a lot of dust for an moderate period of time these problems kinda vanished until I moved back to my old house where although I don’t live in absolute filth it has LOTS of dust around. So I began to question if these conditions were correlated in any way which lead me to this site, so to put it short: can my disposition and sleep problems be due to the fact that I'm living and sleeping in an house with a lot of dust?

Sunday  But to our surprise next day morning we found that it was hive- huge patches of skin and when touched I get to see original color of the skin (blanching) we rushed to doctor and they asked to give Benadryl, we went back to home and did the same. After two doses of that medication we have seen patches didn’t go and are swollen , that’s when we rushed to emergency. They looked at him and said it is some infection as he also had fever by that time they suggested Tylenol with Benadryl and sent us back to home they also said it can’t be amoxicillin as allergy wouldn’t take that much time to come out, they asked to follow-up with family doctor. They did a blood test and we found ERCS : 5.49 High (3.90-5.30), MCV 69.4 LOW (75 – 87) and MPV 8.3 LOW (9.0-13.0) these are only values which are not as per charts. Doctors said, he had iron deficiency and rest of things are quite normal.  Monday We went back home, and administered medication, next day morning we went to our family doctor, he looked at report and asked if anyone in family has thalassemia, which we aren’t sure, however during that visit my son wasn’t able to stand properly as his legs were swollen along with hands, upon asking doctor if we need to go to emergency he said to go and written a letter, we rushed to emergency and as we went there they did a urine test which was absolutely normal (fever was still on) but they gave a dose of steroid and hives came down thus we went home with course of steroid,  Tuesday  On Tuesday I have given my son Tylenol+bynardyl at first step and after some gap of 2 hours I gave him steroid, that’s when hives came back as well as lips were swollen, we called in help line to know if that’s serious. Helpline asked us to go to doctor in ER within 3 hours, that scared us and we went to ER, ER guys made us sit for some time and moved us into Acute care, there my son was administered epinephrine 0.1 ml + Benadryl , latter slowly hives were coming down, we were damn happy, after 2 hours hives completely went away, I thanked God for this moment. We were moved into normal observation ward and asked to wait,  Wednesday Early morning : I was sleepy and my son was on my shoulders sleeping silently, I noticed some uncomfortable moments in him, when I looked at him, he was all patchy on his face, his head was red and his tummy, back was full of hives, this time lot bigger then I have ever seen, I got scared and shouted out for nurse , they moved us back to acute care and gave another dose of epinephrine 0.1 ml + Benadryl, again same thing happened, but after 4 hours hives were coming back, that’s when staff in acute care called in pediatrician, he came after 2 hours, until then nurse kept wet towel on hives, once doc was in they grilled us down until his birth and they said my son is a tuff fellow, and gave him Advil + Benadryl, this brought down the hives, doc asked us to give steroids, (2 more doses) Advil once we go home that afternoon and give Claritin one dose a day until hives stop coming , after going home, we gave him Advil and with some gap gave steroid. After giving steroid, again hives came back with full power, and he looked like a patchy boy with half of his face full of patch, now I didn’t get panic, instead I took him to bathroom and gave a Luke warm water shower , to our surprise all the hives went way in minutes and he was my darling son again, he slept like a baby as he always did,  Thursday but again at 3:00 am he wakes up and cries out in pain, now, I took him into bathroom, and applied cold water on parts where he is complaining, he again slept off , I came to my work my wife stayed back home taking care of him , I called my wife she said, now patches are coming and going but aren’t that dark anymore. I beg god to bring my son out of this pain, he is just over 2 years.  In this whole, story, here are main points followed by my question.  Note : Goes to daycare from 18th month onwards.  1.	Amoxicillin given for ear infection  2.	Hives started Saturday afternoon  3.	first medication two doses of Benadryl (blood test done, ERCS : 5.49 High (3.90-5.30), MCV 69.4 LOW (75 – 87) and MPV 8.3 LOW (9.0-13.0) – doc said all is well ) 4.	all red, rushed to emergency, fever started – Benadryl +Tylenol given  5.	legs, hands and face swollen, went to family doc, he asked to go to emergency (throat tongue were not swollen and ears didn’t had infection)  6.	Tylenol + steroid given at ER (throat tongue were not swollen and ears didn’t had infection) 7.	Came home, gave Benadryl + steroid  8.	Swollen lips, rushed to ER in midnight and administered epinephrine 0.1 ml + Benadryl X 2 time in 9 hours.  9.

After a few days I started having some pain. I went back to the dentist and he prescribed Amoxicillin for the infection that I now had. After a week the pain was horrendous. They prescribed me Tylenol with Codeine 325mg & Ibuprofen 800mg. After I began taking the pain meds (day one of pain meds & day two of Amoxicillin) I noticed that I was getting a skin rash and it was very itchy. Also, my upper lip began to swell. I made an appt with the dentist again but I continued to take all the meds because I was in too much pain & I didn't want to stop the antibiotic that was supposed to be helping the infection. My mom was worried so I stopped the Amoxicillin two nights before my appt. I went in to see the dentist and told him about the rash & that I was still in pain. I hadn't actually been taking the Tylenol too much because it didn't actually help with the pain. He prescribed me a new antibiotic assuming the allergy was from that. (Note: I've never had a reaction to a medication before). He gave me Clindamycin 150mg & told me to take 50mg of Benadryl for the reaction & OTC ibuprofen for pain (I was out of the prescription). It has been three days since I saw him & I am still pretty itchy and it seems as though every time I wake up my upper lip is even more swollen than the day before! I am trying not to take anymore ibuprofen just in case that is the culprit but my lip is in some pain.

I was looking up something and came across your posts and read them as I am having itching from head to toe. I thought I would drop my thoughts down hoping it would help. First I wanted to ask your ages as hormone I'm balance can cause this and it would not be checked on a CBC Panel (blood work). Anything that has to do with the nerves in your body such as Fibromyalgia can cause this. If you have Fibromyalgia which is very hard to diagnose your nerves in your body can be highly sensitive. All Auto Immune Disorders have a side effect of itching from head to toe which is my problem. A Rhumatologist is the doc you want to see for Auto Immune Disorder testing. I have APS syndrome diagnosed at 20 now about to turn 45 and not one symptom other than 2 miscarriage untill 2 months ago. Also anxiety can have a side effect of itching mild to severe. If you don't drink enough water a day your body can itch. It's actually a very common side effect to many things. Allergies period seasonal or nonseasonal can cause itching. Having oily skin or dry skin can cause this. I hope you find your answers and resolve your itching as I know how you feel. Try yoga or some meditation to relax. Your body can be thrown out of wack by the slightest of things. I hope this helps and I think I listed everything I could think of to help. Unless combined with some other symptoms and believe me your body will let you know I wouldn't worry about it being serious. More so to find things that help the itching get better.

I personally have dealt with a lot of sneezing, a runny nose, excessive phlegm, and very swollen tonsils. One week was especially hard with my throat hurting very badly, so I went to visit a walk-in clinic because my primary care doctor is in another town. He told me my lymph nodes wouldn't be swollen from mold, but my rapid strep test and cultures came back negative for anything. I was put on medication for strep throat, which helped a lot except my tonsils never stopped being swollen. I went back to the clinic for this and saw I different doctor. He did another rapid strep test and more cultures, on top of a test for mononucleosis. Everything was negative once again. Here I am two months later with chronically swollen tonsils.

I’m 24 years old and I have researched a lot about ADD/ADHD, when I read up, take quizzes, listen to people’s ADHD stories, I feel like it is the story of my life! It has seemed to have negatively impacted my life dramatically. So right from a child I have always struggled concerntrating, not finishing or last minute homework than I am more than capable of doing, struggling with organisation and punctuality in lessons, always losing and forgetting things and become agitated by sitting still and waiting for things. These are traits I have carried through into adulthood and has become a real barrier to achieve in home life and career. I have a 6 year old son and struggle to even get him to school on time purely from becoming distracted so easily and having no sense of time management! I have always been intelligent and have great potential to do well and that is why my family and friends get so frustrated with me! I started a university course in September 2016, through procrastination, disorganisation, punctuality I failed my first year. And again failed my second attempt at first year. Not because I am not capable but because as much as I want my degree, as much as I try and change I just fall back into the same dysfunctional route. I fail to do anything that I find boring in life for example missing bill payments, filling out forms. My financial situation is poor due to my impulsivity with shopping and going out. I get obsessed for short periods of time with things and hyper focus on them. I have crashed my car twice on the drive into family members cars from not focusing and not having the patience to be careful!! I feel I need help because it is now taking over my life, I want to have a good future, I have great potential to achieve but I’m my own worst enemy even though my intentions are good. My sons teachers have also mentioned about getting my son diagnosed without knowing how I am, as he matches a lot of symptoms too. Advice please!? X","Symptoms , ADHD in Adults"

Please read to the end as this is the tricky part. I will try to make this long story as short as possible. He started to have bilateral wrist pain 1.5 years ago. In addition he lost weight, became depressed and fatigued. He had started working at a new job that required repetitive wrist movements so we assumed it was related. We went to ortho and primary. They ruled out lymes, arthritis and a number of other viruses. EMG was negative. The second ortho found a tear through contrast mri in his right wrist which was the wrist causing the most pain. He eventually had surgery. However he continues to lose weight and have pain in both wrists and forearms. Due to the chronic pain he has become anxious and depressed. I am a very worried mom. Here is the kicker - he just told me that a week before the onset of the pain and start of the downward spiral he got electrical shock at work. Someone left a machine on that should not have been and he grabbed a part and had a minor shock go up both hands to the elbow. No burns, no horrible pain, no dizziness so he went on with his day.  I am feeling frustrated and not sure where to turn next. Could the shock have done damage that no one is picking up? what type of doctors deal with electrical shock issues? Any thoughts? -LC",

I had out from my job for weeks. i was home alone with my cat for a long time. i drank something put some chillout music and was looking for mood swings, depression. then i found bipolard disorder. i tought it could be my problem. few days later i was looking further and then i found adhd. The first thing i did was reading all the Symptoms slowly. everytime i read one of them, tousands of memories come to surface. i dont know how to get through this thats why im here now. i know that if i would go to a doctor or psychologist ( sorry i dont know the right word in english) as soon as i would collect my toughts i would just freaking cry i couldnt even talk 2 sentences. and that would take tousands of hours and even more money.  i guess it all started in my childhood. i was often bullied because i was already very tall, everytime someone looked at me my head went red and everyone laughed. i never could pay attention in the school, so my mom spend a lot of time with me at home to learn, sometimes even more time that i spent in the school. and that was only one subject... my mom had a job so she didnt really had time just like my father who worked far away from us and he could really be with us. and when he was he was just angry, was screaming with my mom and me and my sister just listened every single weeked what happened. i dont blame them , since i respect them and i try to help them. but how should i help others when i cant even help myself. when i dont even understand whats wrong with me. i read a lot about adhd threatment. first of all , i stopped smoking. this was way easier than i tought and this gave me such a motivation to go further. then i started to really care about what i eat/drink. i started to follow nutritionsts on social platforms. i even started to workout a little bit. stopped eating candy and trashfood. ( sometimes i eat trashfood but only when i know i ate enough normal food )  i moved home to my parents and i slowly tried to tell them that i really sorry about my past, about everything i did wrong. i even told them that i love them even tho i didnt said it in YEARS. the only thing i cant control is anxiety and stress. even if i have plan for a day, im alone and i feel like im lost in this world, alone and depressed again. and i know that i have to sleep but i cant bacause i start to sweat. just like in public when i start to speak or the attention is on me. i knew that a girlfriend could help much. so i met one girl and i tried to be open minded with her. i show her only my positive site and my motivated self because i knew that i need one girl who is good and knows what is good for me. i could do anything for her. really. today , just before i wanted to talk about my adhd to her, she said we are better stay friends. probably cause i couldnt give her enough free space and time. i accept that... i told her that i hope we could meet sometime and just talk about what i really wanted to talk about. even if i know that she cant be mine anymore :( and im here now. i was never so confused","ADHD in Children , Living With , Symptoms , Treatment & Care , Diagnosis , ADHD in Adults"

ADD/ADHD,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/77287/undiagnosed-adhd,Undiagnosed ADHD,"I am just fuming. I've recently started my first year of college and while the workload for freshman year hasn't been much thus far, I still have been having issues. Having all this space to myself allowed me to have a lot more time to think - it almost seems like too much at times. Sometimes I'll just be alone in my dorm room and sit on my bed and state into space. My mind will go from thought to thought and I find myself paralyzed, a slave to this endless train of thought. In addition to this I keep leaving assignments to the last second because I simply cannot get myself to concentrate on them beforehand. This has always been a problem since high school, where I stayed up countless nights to achieve the almost all straight A's I earned throughout my high school years. I finally took action after yesterday, when I finished a final project just mere minutes before it was due. It was such a tight squeeze to finish it and I was haunted once again by that awful feeling of irresponsibility, internally bashing myself for not taking initiative and finishing it ahead of time when in reality, I was unable to. This was really the last straw, I knew something had to be up. I am intelligent and talented and I know I'm capable of so many things, I'm even trying to teach myself a 3rd language for Pete's sake, but I can never really ""finish"" anything. ADHD in my home was a blasphemous word. I distinctly recall having mentioned it to my mom, who I believe has her own slew of mental illnesses, and her immediately dismissing the topic. She would say that ADHD is just something that psychiatrists made up to make more money from prescriptions. As a child I believed her. I even questioned whether I had it which she would also dismiss as nonsense. 8 years later, here I am, not being able to focus on the most insignificant thing. I feel debilitated, and paralyzed by my thoughts.  I finally called my father to ask him if my elementary school teachers ever discussed the topic of ADHD with my parents. His answer didn't even phase me. He confirmed that yes indeed my second grade teacher and teachers that followed all tried to tell them. In fact at one time, one of them even proved it to my parents by having them visit school. She gave me and my fellow students the same set of directions and I would fail to complete all of them as opposed to my classmates who got it all done. My arrogant mother denied it all, remarking later that ""how dare she label him"" and that ""they just want to label the hispanics with things like ADHD so that they can fall behind."" Funny enough, my father also strongly believes that my mother herself has the disorder, as she is always scrambling last minute to get stuff done and the attempts that are made to prevent this are futile. She is always late to things, forgets her keys constantly, this among other things that I too suffer from. What makes this realization disturbing is that it is very likely that throughout my childhood, my mother constantly bashed me for being late to school, taking forever to get things done, things that she also did, and I'm afraid she was in reality, bashing her inner ADHD self whom she was and still denies, through me, who was at the time, an innocent unknowing child. Upon being told this literally yesterday I was, as previously mentioned, fuming. This disorder has prevented me from doing so many things like having free time, spending time with friends in high school etc. Granted I attended a rigorous high school, which made it even more difficult to get good grades. I was always staying up trying to finish the next book, add the last touches on that essay, solve that math problem, when it was my Adhd that prevented my from focusing. Reflecting back it seems almost superhuman to have pushed through this unknown ailment to the extent that I did. I relayed my anger to my father, asking him why he didn't bother to be the parent and take his child to the doctor when his teacher literally told you and proved to you that he probably has Adhd. What makes this more painful is that his irresponsibility to do this serves as yet another treatment to his neglect of me as a child. We've finally resolved to go to the doctor in a week and even that feels long. I've never been more sure of something in my life and I can't wait to get diagnosed and treated so that I can hopefully experience ""having my brain turned on"" as one put it in an article about the disorder. Still awaiting my appointment, I find myself waking up with an unnamable anxiety some mornings, including this morning. My heart thumps heavily and I can't subdue it with the coping mechanisms I have used my whole life. This is such a debilitating disorder, but I'm so happy to have come to this realization.","Living With , Symptoms , ADHD in Adults"

I am not bipolar! I've read a lot about bipolar and I have some symptoms, but mine present differently. I don't have mania and my lows are not that low. I just know I am not bipolar, and these psychiatrists keep insisting that I am.

He said he agreed, but we would deal with that way down the road. How??? For that kind of money, I should've spent the day there with electrodes hooked up to me, trying to figure out what's wrong with my brain. How can you tell what's wrong with anyone after talking to them for five minutes? When I was a child, I stepped in a smoldering fire, not realizing that it was still burning underneath. I had 3rd degree burns on my feet, but I was holding my hands, so my Mom thought it was my hands that were burned, so she was holding my hands under the water. That's what I feel like is going one with damned doctors. They are treating a part of my brain that's not on fire. It's the same story every time! I keep going to these psychiatrists with high hopes that someone is going to help me, but they don't. They just put me on these ridiculous meds that do nothing for me.

I have been going to them my entire life, and they have never helped me. I am still just as screwed up as I have every been. This last guy actually told me that I might have a personality disorder, in which case there was nothing he could do for me. This is after talking to me for 5 minutes. I had another psychiatrist tell me there was nothing they could do for me, and that my condition is untreatable. My last great experience was with a woman who would get angry with me for questioning her diagnosis, then she kept me waiting for almost two hours for my last appointment. I had to pick up my four year old son, and had to leave. I had just paid a 50.00 co pay and asked for it back because I couldn't stay. The psychiatrist came out of her office and said, ""I am not on his schedule, tell him not to come back here."" She said this in front of her staff and the entire waiting room. This was after 3 years of going to this... person. This wasn't urgent care, this was a doctor who deals with people with mental issues, and she chooses to embarrass me because I couldn't wait 3 hours for my appointment. I am not someone who uses my issues as an excuse. I work really hard in spite of them. I have learned, by myself, some amazing coping techniques, but they aren't working like they used to.

He has difficulty in completing his school work; he frequently says he cannot focus. He will often proceed very slowly. He is forgetful in other ways as well. My wife thinks he might have ADD or ADHD. She had ADHD and might be more prone to think our child has it while I might be biased in the other direction. His lack of focus on his school work is, in my opinion, his only symptom. He is, and has always been a very well behaved child. He is very emphatheic to others, can wait his turn, is never figity. He his very accomplsihed in other areas. For example, he has taught himself guitar, drums and keyboards. For the last several years he has organized neighborhood children and produced several videos. This has taken quite a bit of technical and interpersonal skills. He does extra curriculuar activities (fencing) and is very coachable.  My question is this: is there a downside to having him tested? I am very worried about a false positive. His mother, steming from her experience, might tell a different story. She sees much similar behavior from my son and herself when she was a teen. We've had his eyesight and hearing tested. He did need glasses, but those have not addressed his concern. At times I think we might be pushing him too hard with his schoolwork. We know he is bright (his test scores and school performance was very high up to the 4th grade.)  I have thought about sending him back to school, but I doubt that would work. We are not home schooling as a philosophy, rather we pulled him from school becuase he clearly was not thriving socially in 5th grade. (Behavior and academics were excellent. He was not challanged at all.) Any suggestions? Thank you",Preteens/Teens

As such, I’ve been on meds for the past 10 or so years. For the past few weeks, however, I’ve decided to abruptly stop using Concerta (of which I recently got a new, higher dosage of 72mg), as I don’t want to depend on them for the rest of my life.

Throughout today I’ve been experiencing many symptoms as a result; I’m anxious and shaky as heck, my mouth feels really dry and my head has felt a bit funny. I’m guessing these are simply due to my body not being used to the meds after so long so I’m not terribly concerned, but nonetheless, I still want to move away from using any medication.

The commonly observed symptoms may include, shortness of breath, low degree fever, wheezing, chest pain, chest tightness, sore throat and persistent cough with excessive sputum secretion (sputum may be clear or discolored). While diagnosing acute bronchitis, chest X-rays are carried out. The X-ray results are not very specific to acute bronchitis but sometimes subtle changes in the bronchial walls in the lower lobes are indicated in the X-rays. White Blood Cell count test is also administered in a respiratory infection. The white blood count is slightly elevated in acute bronchitis while in other respiratory infections like pneumonia; the white blood cell count is significantly increased. Antibiotics are being inappropriately prescribed and misused throughout the United States, according to experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Published in the journal AJMC, the new study discusses the prevalence of antibiotics use among outpatients, specifically those using a commercial health plan. It concludes that the misuse of antibiotics tops the list of why antibiotic resistance is growing. Source:",Treatment

This is my first post and I'm not typically one for message boards but I am feeling a little desperate lately. Maybe someone knows of something I can mention to my doctor that we haven't yet explored.  I am a 31 y.o. female. I have Crohn's Disease that was diagnosed ~7 years ago & is currently in remission. I receive bi-monthly Remicade infusions to maintain remission.  In July 2017 my hands/forearms began going numb. The numbness would not go away despite position changes. The numbness was painful and would wake me up in the night. I saw the doctor. She did x-rays on my hands & neck (both normal), a full blood work-up was ordered (normal), and an EMG was performed. The EMG revealed mild Carpal Tunnel in my right arm, but this didn't explain the issues in my left arm or account for the severity of my symptoms. I was sent to Physicals therapy for 8 weeks, which did little to nothing. Meanwhile. The pain moved to my upper arms and began in my hips.  The pain is very much so associated with movement, not painful to the touch. It feels stiff and I've joked that it must be rigor Mortus (sp?). When I received my Remicade infusion, all the pain subsides within 24 hours. However, within 1 week the pain returned. Less in my arms and more in my hips/knees.  After another infusion, the pain subsided and returned within a week. This time solely in my feet and far worse than ever before.  I've seen my GP several times and she is at a loss. I've spoken with my GI, also at a loss. I've seen a neurologist who gave me a muscle relaxer to take before bed. This accomplished nothing. The muscle relaxer didn't even make me tired.  I'm scheduled to see a Rheumotologist in March, but worry it will be pointless. Currently, I've struggling more and more everyday to simply stand & walk. So, I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts as to things I should consider as a diagnoses.  I've considered and been tested for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Polymyalga Rheumatica, and Lyme Disease. And, as mentioned, a full bloodwork came back normal.  (I eat relatively well, but am not super health conscious; I used to be somewhat active but have been falling more and more into a sedentary lifestyle due to the pain). Hopefully that's enough info for someone to throw something out there!  (Yes, I know this is crowdsourcing & not trained medical advice!)",

So, anterograde amnesia (short-term memory loss) can vary in exact effects and severity, but I can't find some specific details on this. I've found that active memory is generally what's affected (so you can form new memories involving general information and skills, but not things like a person's name or face), but I can't find if this is always absolute. For instance, is it POSSIBLE that someone with anterograde amnesia could remember some things? Could someone have a mild (but permanent) case where they only lose some of their new memories? Like they might forget a conversation mid-sentence or might not; they might forget what they had for breakfast but remember meeting someone new; or they may need something repeated a few times but could remember it after a bit of repetition. Alternatively, could someone simply have a generally hazy short-term memory where they do remember things but just don't remember them CLEARLY? If so, would this still be classified as anterograde amnesia? And lastly, how rare would these things be, assuming they're possible? Would a traumatic brain injury be able to cause this effect?",

However, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) is classifying kratom as a schedule 1 drug effective Sept. 30, which has sparked an outrage among kratom advocates.  Whether it is a dangerous drug or a lifesaving herb is up for debate, but it sparks the need for a greater discussion. What alternatives are out there for chronic pain sufferers? How do you treat your pain without the use of opioids? I think whether we realize it or not, we're all on the same mission to find a way to treat pain without the need for potentially harmful drugs.

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/1627/some-ways-i-manage-constant-spinal-nerve-pain,Some ways I manage constant spinal nerve pain,">Close to forty years ago I damaged my spine seriously enough to require surgeries to prevent further damage. To date, I have had seven surgeries for my back and neck (reference data) 1: Walking is a problem for me due to nerve damage but I do use isometric exercises to keep my leg and core muscles strong. Isometrics aren't referred to as often as they used to be but they do work, especially if walking is difficult and causes more pain as you walk. 2: Meditation works! Forget the scientific business, meditation allows you to define your pain areas and pain levels and to use your mind as a tool to reduce your discomfort. 3: Determine exactly what hurts rather than simply saying ""It hurts"". Try to localize the areas where your pain is the greatest and focus self-treatment there. TENS systems are OTC now and for lower back pain they work (at least they do for me). Transdermal Lidocaine (prescription) works too - by stopping the ""migration"" effect of pain. Counter-Irritants can work provided your skin doesn't react; Menthol, Capsacin, and mixes thereof can help contain one's pain to a specific area where it can be effectively treated. 4: The Battle Creek system of alternating hot and cold packs works wonders for sprains and strains in the external muscles and joints by (cold) reducing inflammation and driving blood away from the area and (heat) relaxing muscles and drawing blood into the area involved. Combined, they reduce swelling and discomfort by flushing the injured area with blood and then carrying away this same blood that now is full of Cox-2 enzymes. It also keeps your mind off how much you are hurting. 5: Changes: ANY change in pain levels lasting longer than a day or two should be reported to your doctor. In some cases, a lessening of pain is a bad thing, not a good one. Tell your doctor now rather than waiting while things get worse. 6: VSE: Visual Self Examination. Always try to visually check the areas that hurt. Never simply assume that ""it's my Sciatica again"". I wound up with a very nasty subcutaneous infection because I didn't keep an eye on things. Just because it hurts do NOT assume the reason. Check it and report any changes to your doctor - unless you like adding more pills and some injections to your regimen like I had to. Never assume and never trust that a given pain is ""the same old pain"". Sometimes it won't be.","Chronic Pain , Neck Pain , Hip Pain , Back Pain"

For years living in NY I have gotten debilitating allergic rhinitis for about 1-2 months depending, in September and October. I recently moved to TX and to my surprise it got much much worse! I didn't think this was actually possible. It is to the point where I really can't function (work, leisure, move around too much) because not only is my mind focused on the frustration of the symptoms but the actual physical symptoms themselves cause me to be constantly draining my sinuses, blowing my nose, sneezing etc. Not to mention when I am at work or with clients its extremely embarrassing and probably uncomfortable for others. This happens indoors and outdoors with no relief during this part of the season. I have tried literally everything from steroids to nasal sprays to perscription pills and air filters. The only thing I have not tired is the immunotherapy which is my current doctors ""final option"" she says, however its extremely expensive, needs to be administered year round, not covered by insurance, and she can't guarantee it will actually work. The only thing I have ever been able to take that relieves most of the symptoms is Adderall. Are there any doctors out there have done any research on this or tried it with their own patients? I know it would not be typical for an allergy specialist to prescribe this type of drug for the symptoms I have but it works. My doctor looked at me like a drug addict when I asked her about it. There are many other online communities out there with people having similar experiences with Adderall relieving their nasal symptoms. The only thing it does not help specific to the hay fever I get is the itchy eyes but heck, I will take that all day if i could get rid of the nasal congestion, snot and sneezing...

I'm all too familiar with that pain, but this pain starts in the dead center of the middle of my back. It's been so intolerable that I almost called for an ambulance.......The pain doesn't even start until I lay down. About 2 hours after I wake the pain has slowly subsided & I go through the rest of the day virtually pain-free.

In the early years I used mostly over the counter pain killers, such as aspirin and Tylenol.

I am thankful to be alive, after emergency surgery. After this I went on many different prescriptions meds, with many side effects.

When my doctor came in he looked at me with concerning eyes and started to ask me questions. These questions were him probing me and giving me a test for ADD. To make sure he was correct he also had me take an online test where he would read the question and I would answer. I was 21 at the time and it was the first time I was diagnosed with ADD. The medication that was prescribed to me causes a lot more damage than good. I started to abuse the drugs and would no sleep for a whole weekend as I was cramming for my studies. This cycle went on for two years until I was taken off the medication per my decision. I did't understand why I even needed to take medication as my life went on normally I just was anxious throughout the day. I knew that I was starting to struggle when my own thoughts were impeding on my daily tasks. During this time I am using tinctures from King Harvest Oil for my anxiety and depression. The tinctures are effective and discreet as I only use 10 drops of my Unwind and Uplift but, it lasts me up to 8 hours.","ADHD in Children , Living With , Symptoms , Treatment & Care , Diagnosis , ADHD in Adults"

We had met a couple of times before very briefly. We met, had lunch, a few drinks, there was lots of kissing (open mouth tongue kissing). I had booked a private booth in an underground bar. Before we went in the bar i went into the toilet/restroom and on the sink was some heavily perfumed and coloured handwash..i put lots in my hand and rubbed it all around the head of my penis (didn't even dilute it) and also dont think i washed it all off properly Anyway inside the private booth lots and lots of heavy kissing, i also put my fingers inside her vagina and also my penis was in her mouth for about 10-15 seconds..that was all. The next day, i notice small painless red bumps on my penis, like little red dots, around 8-10. Now..i also was suffering from a fungal infection in my groin, like jock itch. I was constantly inspecting my penis on Friday the day after and its totally possible i scratched my fungal infection then touched he head of my penis. On the satarday the spots had started to fade, by Sunday they had virtually gone (again all the time maybe scratching my fungal infection and touching my penis head), then on Monday morning i noticed a very slight burning near my peehole and just underneath it, Tuesday it was still there..its not painful when i pee but i can feel the heat a little bit more than usual. So i tell the woman..she is mortified that i am worried about this..her only sexual contact was back last August with her then husband who she split with in November, she is not a promiscuous woman. (she has also gone back and asked her husband about symptoms of anything of which he has hsaid he's not had symptoms of anything and never has) Also...she had a tiny coldsore on her lip..that had completely healed and dropped off the week before we met..she even went to see the pharmacist who confirmed there was nothing there and she was not contagious (because we wanted to kiss). She has no symptoms whatsoever of anything I have gone and got some canesten/thursh cream and have been putting that on, it is getting better but i am now thinking by smothering my penis head in canesten it is making it even more sensitive lol.. I have no other symptoms, i feel well, no visible marks or anything on my penis or the penis head, no disharge that i can see. It it possible it may still be the irritation from the soap getting into the urethra, or maybe i have transferred some bacteria from my fungal infection?

I was hospitalized for days, bedridden for months, used a walker for months, went to PT for years and have tried everything and anything for pain relief.  It is now almost 6 years later, I'm 27 years old, and in unbelievable chronic, dehabilitating pain. I have immense trouble with mobility and strength and EVERYthing affects it. Driving hurts, sitting, standing, walking, lifting, pushing, pulling, writing, reaching... everything creates pain. I am living in a complete cloud of misery. Funny thing about it is this: I don't look like it! Or act like it! I am a chirpy, ""fit + healthy"" seeming, bubbly, hardworking girl. I don't mope around, I try not to complain or speak up too much about it. So when I do, whether its a new doctor or old- they aren't taking me serious! I know for a fact multiple doctors think I'm fine.. they say I'm young, I've ""recovered"". But I haven't and it is ruining my life. My weekly schedule consists of acupuncture sessions, cranial sacral therapy, massage, grounding, restorative yoga, swim and have been in and out of physical therapy for years. I've tried so many types of therapy I don't even know what else is left. I have also seen so many specialists and doctors, I've given up. No matter what I do, I am in copious amounts of pain. One exception- Once in a blue moon on a RAGING flare up, I will take half a pain killer. This is the only time I feel complete relief from pain. But, I'm scared of being a person that ""relies"" on pain killers, so I don't take them often. PLUS- there is such a bad connotation with ""young people"" and pain killers that doctors smirk at me if I even bring them up. I've been out of Hydrocodone for the past month and have had such horrible pain I can't go to work anymore, be active or do much at all. Pain: My biggest issue these days in an excruciating sharp pain in between my shoulder blades in my upper back. My neck flares up and becomes a sharp pain up through my head. My entire upper back scar tissue is rock hard and full of knots. And now my right arm has become completely numb and/or will have sharp pains down through my palm and fingers. My right arm and right leg have uncontrollable spasms nightly at this point.  I was told by a doctor that I have bone spurrs between C6 and C7. And I was also recently told by a massaeust that my shoulder blades are very misaligned and uneven. She said my right shoulder blade is low and sunken in while my left is bulging out. Perhaps these are the causing a nerve to be pinched and why my right arm is having so many issues?  I need help as soon as possible. The pain has become so extreme, I honestly feel like I am dying. I need to figure out a solution, some sort of real relief, but no doctor ""cares"" or will listen to me because I'm just TOO YOUNG. Too young for surgery, shots, anything. I'm sorry but I am too young to feel like I am 100 years old and bedridden at 27 years old.  I'm open to any suggestions- holistic, western, eastern, whatever.

I am a middle-aged male (age 59) interested in determining whether or not I was sterilized (involuntarily) during my early childhood. If this event occurred it would have been roughly between the ages of 2 to 5 years of age. During that time I was subjected to two operations, supposedly to correct a birth defect (grossly malformed eye lid, huge amount of excess skin in the lid). Evidence that I later accidentally found casts doubt on the complete accuracy of this reason for the operations. There was clearly an unmistakable congenital deformity in my left eye lid that I personally observed in a photograph that I later accidentally found during my twenties. This photo of me was taken when I was an infant and prior to the eye operations, and it was the only photograph of me as an infant that I have ever seen. Whatever other pictures that may have existed have been hidden from me or destroyed. This birth defect was so egregious that nobody, lay person or experienced healthcare professional, could have possibly missed it or mistaken which eye was affected. However, the 'story' that I was given by my parents throughout my life was that the surgeon operating on the malformed eye 'accidentally' operated on the wrong eye during the first operation. The second operation was supposedly necessary to correct the original defect and reverse the earlier mistaken surgery on the normal eye. This story simply doesn't hold water, based upon what I saw in that photograph of me. I wonder what else was done to me then, while I was 'under the knife' that second time. My family lived in southwestern Virginia during that time and Virginia has a well-known history of eugenic sterilizations for numerous dubious reasons. There was ample history in both sides of my family to make me suspect that some agency may have coerced my parents to allow my sterilization during one of these operations as an alternative to permanent institutionalization. Given that the fallacies of eugenics were beginning to be increasingly questioned following WW II, I very much doubt that any records were made of this sterilization event if it happened, or if those records would have survived until now if they were made. Would a sperm count test at my age reveal unambiguous evidence of whether or not that I was sterilized? If not, is there any other test or examination that might reveal whether or not I was sterilized at an early age? At this stage of my life, I have zero interest in fathering children, but rather I am trying to fill in some missing pieces of my own history for peace of mind.",

We lied on the bed and mutually masturbated. I did not touch his penis nor did he touch mine. We only pleasured ourselves whilst watching each other laying next to each other. However, when i came, he wiped up cum from pubic region/stomach with his hand and then used it on his own penis as lubrication. As far as I can remember, this is the only physical contact we had. I am extremely worried that since he touched me i have a risk of contracting an STI. He assures me that he has recently been tested and is all clean. I have a wife and I do not want to put her at risk. This has been a terrible mistake and I wish my curiosity did not get the better of me. Can someone please advise if I have put myself at risk.","Chlamydia , HPV/Genital Warts , Men's Issues , Gonorrhea , Genital Herpes"

My symptoms began in 2011 and have gradually become so bad that I had to stop working. I've taken OTC pain meds and on 2 occasion prescribed pain meds for a short time because I fell twice in the last year due to my limited mobility and fractured my ankle the first time and broke my wrist the second time. And OTC meds just weren't helping with my knee pain on top of the pain from both falls. I've also had Cortisone and Euflexxa shots. Neither give me much relief for more than a month. So my Orthopedic Dr. and I agree to get back to a somewhat normal life I should have total knee replacement surgery.

My question/worry is that I have been opioid dependant and addicted to pain meds in the past, and have currently been on subxone for 3-4 years and am still taking it to this day, my tolerance is extremely high to opioids although my suboxone dose is now lower than thought possible, like .4mg a day (I have tried to come off the suboxone several times but have not been able too because of pain I assumed was withdrawals, it makes me wonder if the pain that I attributed to suboxone withdrawal was really pain from the kidney stones this whole time, but I know nothing to prove this. ) What are the options for pain medications for this? Are there alternatives to opiates that work effectively? Is there alternatives to opioids? I do believe I could control myself, especially with my mothers help, if I had to do opiates, but I really am hoping there is a better way to relieve severe pain. If there is not a good alternative, is it even possible to go on an opiate pain medication while on suboxone or is that not possible as an option? My mother is willing to fly up and stay with me, and I know she would be willing to hold my medication for me.

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/328/exercises-for-lower-back-pain,Exercises for Lower Back Pain,"Back pain is a very common affection, which does not take into account age anymore. Whether it's because you sit all day long at your desk in an unhappy position, you've forced your muscles through exercise or simply because you've carried too many grocery bags, you just know how unpleasant back pain can be and how it can stop you from conducting your daily activities normally.  So, what should you do? Some simple exercises that you can do when you're in pain but that you have to execute frequently to relieve pain, recover faster in the future to prevent other such trauma and strengthen your back muscles. If you resort to inappropriate   , they can have grave consequences on your back, which is a very sensitive area that should not be forced. Here are a few exercises for lower back pain relief that can be done at home: Partial Crunches  Whenever you have acute low back pain, avoid the exercises that can make things worse. Partial crunches are just the answer to your condition because they help you strengthen your back and stomach muscles. Lie on your back on the floor with your knees bend and feet flat on the floor. Put your hands behind your neck, tighten your stomach muscles and then raise your shoulders off the floor, while breathing out. Do not use your arms to pull your neck off the floor. Hold for a second and then slowly lower back down. Repeat 8-12 times. Make sure your feet, lower back and tailbone are constantly in contact with the mat. Hamstring Stretches  Lie on your back on the floor and bend one knee. Take a towel and loop it under the ball of your foot. First, strengthen the knee and then slowly pull it back towards your chest with the help of the towel. Hold for 30 seconds. Repeat 2 to 4 times for each leg.  Wall Sits Stand at a distance of 10 to 12 inches from the wall. Try to lean back until your back is flat against the wall. Slightly bend your knees, while pressing your lower back into the wall. Hold for a count to ten and then slowly slide back up that wall. Repeat 8-12 times. Press-up Back Extensions  Lie on your stomach on the floor and place your hands directly under your shoulders. The extension starts by pushing with your hands so your shoulders can lift off the floor. If that's too easy for you, just place your elbows on the floor directly under your shoulders and hold for a couple of seconds. Bird Dog Start on your hands and knees and concentrate on tightening your stomach muscles. Lift and extend one leg behind you and then hold for 5 seconds. Switch to the other leg. Repeat 8-12 times for each leg. Make this exercise a little bit harder by lifting and extending the opposite arm for every repetition. Knee to Chest Start with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Bring your right knee to your chest, while keeping the left one flat on the floor. During the exercise, make sure your lower back is pressed to the floor. Hold for 30 seconds. Repeat with the other leg. Do this four times for each leg.  Pelvic Tilts  Lie on your back on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Feel the contraction in your stomach as you were preparing for a punch. Press your back into the floor and feel your hips and pelvis rocking back. Breath in and out and hold for 10 seconds. Repeat the exercise 8-12 times. Bridging Lie on your back with your knees bent and heels touching the floor. Push the heels into the floor, squeeze your buttocks and lift your hips until you form a straight line between your shoulders, hips and knees. Hold for 5 seconds and slowly lower. Rest for 10 seconds and then repeat 8-12 times. Lifting Weights Lifting weights does not hurt your back as long as they are done properly. As a matter of fact, it helps relieve the back pain. Before submitting your lower back to such effort, ask your doctor if you should or should not lift weights. Aerobic Exercise Doing aerobic exercise implies so many advantages. It strengthens your lungs, heart and blood vessels and it also helps you lose weight. Also, walking, swimming and biking may help relieve back pain. Pilates Moves Pilates is a combination of stretching, strengthening and core abdominal exercise. Ask for the help of a professional when engaging in such physical activity. Make sure you tell him about your back pain because you may need to avoid some moves.",Back Pain

The burning/discomfort is still there but now seems to be moving down the urethra and the tip of my penis is very sensitive. It's very uncomfortable feeling the tip rub against my underwear. I plan on seeing a urologist if the problems persist after i finish the antibiotics but was wondering...Does this sound like urethritis maybe? Something else?  Also, I should add two things to consider: (1) I had been using a new body wash that I quit using 2 days ago (if that was causing inflammation of the urethra, how long before it clears up? Immediately after stopping use, or longer?), and (2) I recently had a mild case of jock itch possibly from wearing new non-cotton underwear which I have stopped wearing a few days ago (can either of those things result in an inflamed urethra?).",Men's Issues

I was wondering if any studies have been done to see if their is any correlation to the two? As far as my back pain goes my hips. lower back. ankles. and feet will hurt at the same time. Is it possible that having one autoimmune could affect more than my thyroid?,"Chronic Pain , Hip Pain , Back Pain"

This situation presented itself and after having some discomfort, I decided to go and see a doctor. Surprisingly, they only asked for a urine sample to test for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. Ultimately, it was found that my discomfort was the result of a ""non-specific urinary infection"", which was quickly cleared up with antibiotics.  My question is whether they ""should"" have tested for HSV and HIV, or are the transmission rates so low that they are essentially deemed to be non-transferable in this way? Can anyone provide the actual transmission rates for a male receiving oral sex? And should I be concerned about/get tested for these?

In November I started waking up with locked knees and pain in both feet when I applied pressure. I addressed it to my doctor and he ran blood work to check for arthritis but everything came back normal. Over time it became worse and I started getting pains in my wrist and fingers. My doctor then referred me to a hand specialist for steroid injections.  This did not help.  Everyday it has worsened and I can hardly walk and use my right hand. I am only 39 and do not do physical labor, but I now feel crippled. It is a nightmare walking down stairs because I cannot bend my ankles.  I decided to get a second opinion because my doctor then referred me to a podiatrist, but it seems strand that feet, knees, and hands are all in pain.  This new doctor stated that I had most of the symptoms of arthritis but I have no swelling nor redness/heat. And of course my blood works came back normal. He originally referred me to the arthritis clinic but they denied me because there is no swelling. Yet, my doctor mentioned that in several cases rheumatoid arthritis can show no swelling and the blood work can show no signs.  What is wrong with me?! I am suffering so bad! Now this doctor straight up told me he couldn’t help me. I told him over and over again, I don’t want pain meds, I said this because I am not a fan of medication and plus, I have never had a doctor deny me, so I was suspicious of his denial. Nonetheless, I just want answers. He then took X-rays and he said they were fine. I also want to mention. I started finding lumps, possibly gangloincysts on my wrists an, my thumb, and Achilles’ tendons. My hand has now been getting numb. Specially in the center of my palm.

They set me up for a cortisone shot and physical therapy. They said I'd feel great when I left, then it might hurt the next day after the lidocaine wore off and then feel better in 3-5 days when the cortisone took effect. I went for the shot today and the doc asked where it hurt and when I pointed to the lower back on my hip she looked surprised and asked if it didn't hurt in the front/groin when I was bending forward, tying my shoes, putting on socks. I said no. So I asked if I was misdiagnosed and didn't need the cortisone shot since the pain is in the lower back/hip and when walking. She seemed to backpedal and say well this will help even if it's the SI joint but if it still hurts after that I should see their SI doc. It defintely still hurts after my shot this morning, despite what they said. I wonder if this shot was even necessary and it feels like I'm being run around to various doctors in this group unnecessarily. shouldn't the source have been clear from the xrays if this is an SI problem or shouldn't they have done an MRI possibily to find out before doing this cortisone shot?

The lady gave me a handjob and anal stimulation with her finger. How likely is it that I could of contracted a std? I saw a my doctor and she took a look at my anus and penis and kinda shrugged me off as if I’m crazy for even being worried about it. Is it possible to catch a std this way? If so which ones? The massage lady She did not have any visible fluids on her hand , her nails were not short but not super long. I don’t think my anus was bleeding becaue I pooped when I got home and when I wiped I saw no blood. Although it’s possible I may have bled. My anus was sore for about a week but I think that’s just because I’ve necer had that done to me before. Also as of a few days ago I’ve noticed my penis has felt a little agitated but only when I’m wearing clothes I have sensitive skin and I feel that it gets agitated when it rubs against my pants or underwear. I masurbate A LOT so I took a night off and I noticed it feels a lot less agitated but not fully better . When I pee and I’m hydrated meaning pee is clear I feel nothing abnormal , but when I’m dehydrated (yellow pee) I feel a slight burn but I also feel like it’s been that way my whole life. About 4 or 5 days after my rub n tug I went to doctor she said everything looks fine I told her exactly what happened and she shrugged it off. Is it possible my penis feels agitated from masturbating every night sometimes twice? Combined with rubbing on my work uniform or clothes throughout the day ? I’ve lightly grabbed my testicles and I feel no pain when I have no clothes on my penis feels fine. What do y’all think?","Chlamydia , HPV/Genital Warts , Men's Issues , Gonorrhea , Genital Herpes"

Arthritis,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/arthritis/52854/need-advice,Need Advice,"I desperately need some advice. I am sorry this is so long. I've been pursuing a diagnosis for a longtime but haven't been given anything definite yet. I have seen a rheumatologist for the first time. He gave me several prescriptions and lab orders for blood work and x-rays and I was to return for the results in two weeks. But while at the pharmacy trying to get the prescriptions filled I found out that my insurance had dropped me. This put a hold on it all for almost 2 months while I had to get all of that straightened out. I was able to get my insurance reinstated finally. I've now had all of the tests that the doctor ordered completed and I go back June 5th to see the doctor to find out the results. But at this point I am so sick and my skin is so bad that I am scared that time may not be on my side right now. The joint pain has completely disabled me. The issues that are happening with my skin are disfiguring me. There are several issues that I think may be contributing factors. I think I may have a connective tissue auto immune disorder. But I also have a history of severe constipation. I am talking really really bad. I often get impacted. I've became really sick over this several times. I've read how the poisons that can get backed up into your system from this can cause all kinds of skin conditions. I also have a habit of compulsive skin picking. I do pick until I make sores but these sores are sorta self inflicted. The problem originates from the chemical response in my brain that stimulates my reaction to pick until I make a sore. But I've got a lot of scarring from it and I am wondering if what's going on now could be a reaction to the damage that's been done to my skin tissue from the picking. It can be common to develop calcium deposits inside of damaged scar tissue. The only other thing that I can think of that could possibly be a contributing factor is the stress I've experienced. I've went through some extremely traumatic events. I've been diagnosed with PTSD. Is it possible that this could have triggered a response from my immune system?? The mornings are the worst. It takes me about an hour and a half before I am able to function after I've woke up. My hands and feet are always swollen. I am always stiff as a board all over. In order to just be able to move it's like I have to break every single joint out of a frozen state. But this happens anytime I am sitting still for a long period of time. My neck gets really bad. Sometimes I wish I had arm slings to free my shoulder sockets from the weight of my arms. I also have had issues with my throat. By the end of the day I started losing my voice. But then my eyes started getting so dry that for the first time in my life I bought eye drops. After this started happening I went to the doctor. We didn't focus as much on how my joints were doing cause the doctor was more concerned with my throat because there was swelling. An ultrasound showed nodules on my thyroids. I had tests done where they stick a needle in the nodules and draw fluid out. The doctor wanted to eliminate cancer. It was benign. But I do have several nodules on my thyroids. This may be causing some of this because your thyroids affect so many things. But I am also aware that dry throat and eyes are symptoms of connective tissue diseases also. I have extreme fatigue. By 3pm everyday my day is over with regardless. But out of everything it is my skin thats the worst. I have noticed that my sweat has became different. At certain times it's like I sweat a lot more and it's stickier. I've also noticed a weird smell. It smells like peroxide. That may sound crazy but it's true. But this seems to happen right before my skin goes through the phases that it does. The texture becomes different like plastic. It seems like thicker pads of skin have developed over my elbows, finger joints and knee caps. Sometimes the sores will appear exactly like little paper cuts. It literally looks like perfectly straight little cuts. At first I did pick at them until I got so overwhelmed with fear because of the whole ordeal. When I did if I squeezed them its like they opened up to little wart like sores inside. But what's so weird is that they usually appear in groups of three and develop into 3 perfect circle sores. Then they become like embedded rocks in my skin. I think it is calcium deposits. The skin gets really hard and red all around the area. It becomes really tender. I have these places all over me. When its all inflamed its the worst pain I have ever felt in my entire life. I literally feel like a raw exposed nerve that's been rolled into broken pieces of glass all over. I am wondering if it's doing this inside of me also. When I look into what kind of sores these could be everything refers to calcium. I did have kidney stones years ago really bad. The stones were sent off and came back as calcium oxalate. They ran tests on my kidneys and determined that I had a condition with calcium in my kidneys. Could all of this just be the result of how my body handles calcium? I don't know what to do. I am trying to figure out what I can do to at least prevent as much damage as possible. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.","Living & Managing , Osteoarthritis , RA , Symptoms , Treatment"

I never got surgery, only physio. Over the last 14 years or so, I've been able to largely function by doing lots of exercise, stretching, and could function at a high level in basketball. As I've gotten older and less active, I've noticed more knee clicking and irritation only when I play sports, or on intense hikes Last month I went for an MRI under surgeons guidelines, and he says the MRI shows partial tears in the vascular and non-vascular interior part of the meniscus, as well as a cyst that has formed, which is probably causing the irritation. I know partial removal of the meniscus is an option, however, I am concerned about: 1. Whether removal will ACTUALLY improve the clicking/irritation and restore full pain free mobility to the knee 2. The probability of developing arthritis/disability and needing a knee replacement I'd like to understand: 1. Is non-surgery an option? 2. If I do nothing, am I exposing the knee to increased probability of arthritis anyways? 3. Is it possible to do only repair, remove the cyst and not remove any parts of the meniscus? 4. Is repair of any worth at this point since the injury is about 14 years old? Thanks so much!","Osteoarthritis , Treatment , Knee Replacement"

During the sex, I specifically remember feeling a lot of friction, but nothing painful. After seeing that my urethra was swollen, I thought maybe I contracted an STI, but it did seem odd that I had no pain peeing nor was there any discharge. As a few days went by, the swelling went down, and everything went back to normal. I ended up having sex with the same girl again about week after our first hookup, but this time with a condom. I woke up the next day and my urethra was swollen again! Just like last time, after waiting a few days, the swelling went down and I did not have any pain peeing. I then left school to come home and I've been worried about this ever since. My urethra swells after I masturbate, and it, again, swelled on New Years when I hooked up with a different girl. I went to the doctor to do an STI test this week, but I feel that I don't have an STI. The doctor recommended that if I don't have an STI, and the problem persists, that I go to a urologist. I'm just worried. Maybe I injured my urethra and it hasn't healed and every time I have sex, I just re-injure it? Has anyone ever had this problem? Thanks.",Men's Issues

It got worse and worse, then my thumb came out of the joint and I had to have surgery on my thumb to put thumb back in, Dr used an implant because my RA would go after ligament they normally use. It worked splendidly. The longer you wait the worse the outlook for a full recovery. SusieQue",RA

Arthritis,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/arthritis/51225/knuckle-and-hand-swelling,Knuckle and hand swelling...,"I recently started a very physical job that involves a lot of pushing and pulling. It is heavy work on my wrists and shoulders, but I never experience any pain during work. I'm realising, however, that every morning I wake up with swollen knuckles and hands. It is only slighlyt painful, more of a discomfort really, but the swelling takes a while to go down. Usually goes down after my morning shower.  I'm worried this might be rheumatism. Does it sound like it? If so, is it dangerous for me to keep working (this is my secondary job, so i can find another if need be)? Could it be something else and is there anything I can do to prevent the swelling?  Thank you for your help!","Living & Managing , Symptoms"

I am worried it is testicular torsion but I have no feeling of nausea, and can’t tell from looking if there is swelling but there is pain to touch. It’s 2:30am so a doctors visit will be hard.
