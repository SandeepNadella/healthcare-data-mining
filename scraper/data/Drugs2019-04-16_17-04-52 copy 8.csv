A few months later he cut it back to 12mg, then a few months later he went to 8mg, a month later he cut back to 6mg, and a month after that he went to 4mg. Since cutting back to 4mg he has had severe headaches. He has been unable to go to work this week due to the severity of the headaches. Last night my wife gave him 2 more mg, so he took 6mg total yesterday. This morning he still has a bad headache, although not as severe, and he seems to be running a fever. He went to a primary care physician yesterday, who gave him ZOFRAN and INDOCIN. The doctor said that if the headaches continue my son will need to go in and will be prescribed a medication used for migraines. He has been taking Celexa and Remeron too. I'm tired of all the drugs that doctors are so quick to prescribe, and after reading many of the posts on this forum about Suboxone withdrawal I am convinced that he cut back too fast. Although, I can't say that I have seen any posts regarding getting headaches as a withdrawal symptom from Suboxone tapering? I would greatly appreciate any advice that you guys could give us.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/5mg-lexapro-mild-anxiety-low-dose-make-981861.html,"Is 5mg of Lexapro enough for ""mild anxiety""? Will this low dose make the stabilizing period easier?","Hi guys, I am new to this website and have a couple questions about Lexapro. Let me give you background. I am a 25 year old female (5'3"", 120 lbs) I first started Lexapro at age 23 for depression in April 2012. After 8 weeks, my body adjusted, and Lexapro worked amazingly with my chemistry. In April 2013, I experienced a lot of crippling anxiety, so my dosed was up to 20 mg. For severe anxiety, I'd say this dose worked perfectly for me. It has been almost 4 months that I have been completely off Lexapro; however, I am reconsidering going back on Lexapro for mild anxiety. When I had severe depression, 10 mg worked great. When I had crippling anxiety, 20 mg was just the ticket. Now, I would say some stressful life events have left me with ""mild"" anxiety. I can deal with it, but I sometimes come home from work and find it impossible to relax. (Even after square breathing exercises, anxiety hypnosis, yoga etc). I have reservations about going back on Lexapro because the 8 weeks, before body adjusts to the lexapro, are very exausting, long, and difficult for me to endure. My appetite comes and goes, and I either experience insomnia or hypersomnia. However, I'm not sure if those 8 weeks will be worth it for mild anxiety. Also, I was wondering if 5 mg of Lexapro would make the 8 weeks more tolerable because it is a small dosage. Additionally, how effective you guys think 5 mg would be for my situation? I should include that I am moving to California in the summer time and plan to get a medicinal marijuana card because I find that to be the best treatment for my mild anxiety, but that is almost 5 months away and I do not want to wait that long. I know a lot of you are going to tell me to ask my Dr. and of course, I will. The problem is she tends to agree with whatever I say, so I wanted another opinion. Thank you "

After that happened, I didn't go in for a few years. But when I went in they told me I needed a cavity filling. I was so scared the first time I scheduled it that I didn't even walk into the office. I called and told them I was sick. So I rescheduled and went the second time, but with my mom and as I was in the chair, I was crying and she was holding my hand. It was horrible. Now, I have to get a root canal on one of my bottom front teeth. It's very in the front so at least they won't be digging in the back. The endodontist prescribed me 2 tablets of 10mg diazepam, one to take the night before to help me sleep, and one to take an hour before the appointment.  What makes me most anxious is not being in control in the chair and the dentist being so close and crowding over me. I also don't like it when I can't swallow, which I think I might be able to do even though my mouth will be propped open (or so I've heard).

My liver was at like maybe stage 1 cirrhosis and just before they approved me for the medicine they told me I have stage 4 cirrhosis. If I knew that this was going to happen I definitely would have just done the interferon shots! I am not ready to die just yet! What does stage 4 cirrhosis mean. Like do I only have a little time left on this planet or is there a way for my liver to work well enough for me to live many more years? Just wondering.

I have taken Xanax in the past, but never Lorazepam. I tried it last Sunday night at bedtime (a week ago), and within the hour, I was out like a light. I didn't wake up during the night like I always do; instead, I slept for a good 7 hours. I told my Dr that I was starting to wake up at night and get panicky about the upcoming flight, so he told me to take 1 at bedtime from then until I leave. I have only taken it twice because I am afraid of running out. (He gave me 30). Last night I took one around 9:30 and it did not knock me out. I had no problem falling asleep but woke up during the night to go to the bathroom (which is my normal routine). I had no problem going right back to sleep, and had no problem getting out of bed this morning. On the day of my flight, I am worried that I will be so panicked that I will refuse to get on the plane, which will be a major disappointment not only to myself but to a big group of friends that are going on this trip.

I would really like to just go to sleep on the plane and wake up 8 hours later at Heathrow. I have also heard that it's important to walk around on a long flight, so that you don't get blood clots - something else for me to worry about.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/doctors-anti-diazepam-617692.html,Why are most doctors anti diazepam ?,"I have struggled for most of my life from early teens to now aged 55 female with severe anxiety. I had a severe breakdown 15 years ago and diazepam literally saved my life. Before being prescribed them I lost weight weighing 5 stone 10 pounds they were the crutch I needed to bring me back from hell on earth. I still struggle on a daily basis with severe anxiety but when and if I muster up the courage to visit the doctor they are so anti diazepam. I am made to almost beg for them they just say go to counselling. I have been to so many counselling sessions, relaxation, yoga exercise (I also have a very loving and supportive family) but everyday is the same waking to an awful feeling of nerves I think it's so cruel to make anyone suffer the way I have to and it's not fair to my husband and family I have very poor sleep as well. Please tell me why if there is a tablet that can relieve my symptoms why can't I have them I just don't understand why I am made to suffer in this way it's a poor quality of life for me .

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/viibryd-experience-year-coming-587681.html,Viibryd- My experience a year on it and now coming off of it?,"Hi everyone! Since I too came here looking for advice and wanted to hear an honest opinion of people taking Viibryd before I began taking the medication a year ago, I wanted to share my experience with others so they could gain some perspective from a non-doctor and normal gal going through many of the same things as you may be.  A little about my anxiety history.. I have been on an SSRI since I was about 11 years old (that's 12 years of meds!) I began with Paxil and remained on that med for about 10 years. Once it began to stop benefiting me I made a change over to Prozac, which seemed like a fine fit, however, the sexual side effects were too much for me so my doctor advised me to try Viibryd because his other patients had such good outcomes from it's use. Going on to Viibryd- Not a difficult transition for me at all. I really can not attest to any of the stomach or intestinal side affects many people have, I was lucky to have an easy go of it. After the two week gradual increase to 40mg I had been on the 40mg for about a year until recently.  Viibryd for a year and coming off of it- From the first month of two of taking Viibryd my main concern in the side affects department was my immediate withdrawal symptoms when I forgot to take the medication. I would feel itchy and almost as if I were having some kind of allergic reaction. The itching was mainly at my nose, neck, and scalp. Speaking with my doctor, he said these were withdrawal-like symptoms, so taking the drug at a similar time everyday was going to be an important thing for me to do.  My only other main side affect is the one that has lead me to come off of Viibryd; the sexual side affects. The best way I can describe it is that my mind and body were just not making a connection. Seeing my boyfriend and being intimate, I was attracted and excited mentally, but it never seemed to reach my body in a physical way. It has been INCREDIBLY frustrating! So I spoke with my doctor and I tapered off over the past three weeks.  (Note: It has been my personal decision to try living med. free. I've been working and working to gain the perspective and experience to get to this point since I first started seeing a therapist for my anxiety issues when I was a 6th grader. Please do not go off any medication without talking to your doctor! It is hard enough as it is tapering off, NEVER stop cold turkey! You will feel terrible!)  I tapered off from 40mg to 30mg for one week, 20mg the next, 10mg the next, and this past week moving to 0mg. The switch from 30mg to 20mg was pretty difficult. I've experienced many vivid dreams, woke up feeling very anxious, and felt some of my typical withdrawal symptoms (itchy, allergic) And now after a week of zero Viibryd I've had some awesome highs and some low feelings too. I haven't felt overwhelmingly happy or joyful for months and months. You know that feeling where you are just flooded with joy, you can't help but smile? FINALLY I've felt it a few days in a row! (looking at a sunset, driving to work one morning drinking my coffee, etc.) Quite invigorating! As for some of the negatives, thus far, I've felt kind of irritable and anxious, but it all comes in waves. It is not constant or interfering too severely in my everyday life. I am also experiencing the itchy, withdrawal symptoms, but not constantly. I am looking forward to this next week off the medication to see how all of this progresses. (I can't wait to feel horny again!)  I hope this has been helpful for anyone looking to read (almost a novel) about someone's experience on this medication. Over all it really was a great drug and I can see how it has helped so many people. For me it is just my time to move on and see how I am without medication, since it has been so long since my body has experienced life any other way! I'd love to hear about anyone else's experiences and support anyone who has any questions. Thanks! All the best, Kristi "

When I was hurting so badly, the barometric pressure was 30:09 and falling. Once it dropped a bit, I was better. I did NOT take the lortab, but was tempted as 2 ALEVE barely did anything for the pain.. I have been largely symptoms free for several years, but we are in storm season where I live along the gulf coast. Would anyone else be on board to track barometric pressure when they feel pain from fibro the worst. Actually pain from any conditon, even if it is NOT fibro related, can. Start tracking it. I know once it starts raining, I am usually so much better, but I really feel its the pressure change, and not the rain itself, that brings relief. Thanks, your friend, pattishan61 "

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/find-zoloft-loses-effectiveness-after-526151.html,Anybody else find that Zoloft loses effectiveness after a while?,"The first time I took Zoloft it worked wonders for me. Everything that I felt was wrong with me seemed to be fixed, which included depression, anxiety, lack of motivation, apathy and obsessive thinking to be exact. Then due to loss of insurance I could no longer afford it and had to taper off. Everything had been going smoothly for a while on the Zoloft (about 2 years) and since I had no choice but to stop taking it, I thought, here goes. Sure enough the depression and it's buddies came back, and luckily I was able to get back on the Zoloft. This time, however, it never kicked in the way it did before, even when I took a greater dosage than I did the first time. It never occurred to me that the Zoloft just wasn't working anymore until I discovered on several forums that many depression sufferers also had an experience with Zoloft losing it's effectiveness over time. My plan is to go to my doctor and switch to a new medication. I'm mainly pretty concerned that this second time around I have been on Zoloft and never even thought that I might need to switch medications. I assumed that since Zoloft worked the first time it would always work. My question is how many more people have experienced this with their antidepressant? Which one were you taking and were you able to switch to one that worked for you? I realize that different ones work differently for everybody, but all of the posts that I've read in which the drug wasn't effective anymore, it happened with Zoloft. "
Fibromyalgia,https://www.drugs.com/answers/what-is-your-experience-with-cymbalta-269102.html,What is your experience with Cymbalta - effectiveness and side effects?,"I was recently changed from my antidepressant Celexa to Cymbalta 60mg to treat both depression and fibromalygia, as this drug is approved to treat both conditions. I first started it about 5 weeks ago at full dose, so I have given it plenty of time. However, I'm not happy with it for depression, and am curious to see what others' experiences are. I was previously on Celexa, and though it wasn't working like it used to, I feel it worked better than Cymbalta. I'm not ""depressed"" in the sense that I'm sad, crying, or technically unhappy. My problem since getting on Cymbalta is a major feeling of apathy, lack of internal drive, lack of interest in social life, no enjoyment in activities that I previous liked, etc. I'm on work leave because of seizure management and a shoulder injury, but I am able to focus on small tasks, and do the house work and clean/organize our home -- though these small things take me an entire day, as I lose focus and don't do it all at once. Side effects: the medication also makes me absolutely exhausted -- I've tried taking it in the morning, at night, etc. I get different side effects at different times of the day -- taking it at anytime except bedtime causes severe nausea and headaches; therefore bedtime it is, so I battle insomnia (not too bad anymore). No matter what, even on 12 hours of sleep, I'm always exhausted and completely apathetic. I feel like I don't enjoy much of anything, I've lost interest in fun, in life. This is obviously a symptom of depression -- not sure if I should give this more time, as antidepressants can take up to 4-8 weeks for complete effectiveness, but I'd prefer not to waste any more time on a drug that doesn't work for me. What has anyone else experienced in terms of effectiveness of Cymbalta for depression, and side effects? Length of time (for efficacy & for side efffects to subside, if relevant)? "

I was upset that they took this allegra d away from me by drs. orders and ins. copany overruled drs. orders for allegra D. I purchased Claritin D 12 hour - more expensive than my allegra d whch up till then was covered by Anthem Heathkeepers. They overruled my drs. orders.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/lexapro-generic-name-brand-944060.html,Lexapro - Generic Vs Name Brand?,"I was switched from Brand name to the generic without realizing it. Shame on me - I should have known. By the time I caught on to what was going on, I found myself in the Black Pit only those with depression can understand. I was not able to concentrate, forgetfulness, crying at the drop of a hat and that overwhelming - how am I going to make it through the day feeling. The battle was back. I had a good career but had to take a leave of absence not able to keep up with my responsibilities and it was affecting my work.  My MD put me back on the Brand Name and double the dose. My insurance only helped a little but I was financially able to cover it and felt it my sanity was worth it. I needed my job - so I went back as soon as possible. Unfortunately it was too soon to take on the added stress of trying to play catch up in addition to my normal responsibilities and I was soon let go. My next refill - my insurance refused it cover any of it. I was still in a position to cover it financially so I paid full price for a 3 mo supply of the name brand, double dose. Thank God. Time passed I felt better, found another great job and have now been there for just over 4 months now. My new insurance will not cover any of the brand name - I had no choice but to give the generic another try. 3 weeks into it now and I'm back in the pit - desperate to be myself again... but simply cannot afford the incredible cost of the brand name.  The nightmare continues... getting ready to lose my new job, desperately trying to pull myself out of this pit.  Are there options with the manufacturer to get the name brand at a reduced cost? Are there other avenues for me to get the meds I need? If you have ANY ideas - Any thoughts... I would appreciate you feed back. With Sincerity and hope. "

I understand that Subs can cause swelling and problems if you have a reaction to it, but according to my subs doc, that will show up within the first few weeks of taking it. I have been on subs since mid August and the first month my Fibro pain was at a 0-1 level. I feel as time goes by my symptoms are getting progressively worse. I have pain in my joints, hands, elbows, ankles, knees, hips... etc. For whatever reason, it seems to me that it is a build up of subs in my system.

I will be going in for testing for RA, Lupus, MS, Thyroid, etc..all of the diseases that have similar symptoms to rule them out, but I feel except for the first month that I was on Subs, I have gone down hill in my pain/aches, etc. I also just recently switched from Cymbalta to Savella to see if I would have better luck with this.

Dr. #4 looked at me kind of cocked his he to the side & said who diagnosed you with Fibromyalgia.He then began to examine me very thoroughly.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/how-can-i-calm-down-my-anxiety-disorder-209314.html,How can I calm down my anxiety disorder?,"Hi everyone, I'm 17, 18 in a week, and I've been suffering with bi-polar disorder, adhd, and an anxiety disorder for about 4 years. When I was first diagnosed I was put on a overfilling list of different drugs, they tried xanax, lexapro, lamectil, adderal, and a few others I don't remember. I decided to deal with it everything naturally, except for my adhd. I've been taking adderall for the past 2 years, and I was doing just fine. About 7 months ago I got out of an abusive and stressful relationship. And about 3 months ago my disorders started surfacing again. I'm a very happy-go-lucky person, but now, when I get angry, there's no calming me down. If I go too long being angry I start panicing and eventually go into a panic attack. I've had 4 so far in the last 3 months where I can't breathe and my chest hurts, and all I can hear is my heartbeat thudding in my ears. Then, my adderall prescription was changed from iinstant release to time release and all hell broke loose. I had about 2-3 panic attacks a day. I saw a psychiatrist and he gave me xanax. I was perfectly fine until the next time I saw him. Except It was hard to sleep and eat. The next week, he switched me back to instant adderall and gave me another medication called vistaril which is an antihistamine/anxiety medication. But all these meds make me feel crazy. Literally. My panic and anger have gotten worse and my psychiatrist doesn't have a very good reputation for listening in my book. I'm miserable and just want to be normal again. I can't lead a successful life without adderall because I can't focus on anything and can't complete any project or tast without it. But I can't take this many episodes. The only way I can explain them is that I'm at war with myself. Part of me wants to be angry and violent and throw things, part of me wants to cry and break down, and part of me knows I'm overreacting and just wants to calm down. Does anyone have any advice? I can't take much more of this. If anyone suffers from bi-polar disorder and anxiety, do you know any methods of calming yourself down naturally. I'm dying inside and just want to be normal again. I can't take it anymore. I'm begging for your help. -Stefani "

I'm 28 now. I currently take Viibryd(A newly approved SSRI) for treatment of depression and I guess somewhat to treat anxiety since it has been shown that serotonin defficiency can cause anxiety, and also Vyvanse for my ADD. Somehow I think these conditions have to all be interrelated. Anyways, symptoms of my anxiety include high blood pressure and heart rate. When I was 18, I had to get a medical wavier when I joined the Army because my pulse was over 90 all three times they took it.  Originally, I only thought Beta Blockers were just really for blood pressure and cardiovascular issues. I previously took the generic equivalent of Coreg (Carvedilol). I stopped taking it a few days ago to see if my vitals would stay normal, and already I've started experiencing anxiety symptoms again, tightness in chest, headache, nervousness just when having conversations with people, and I've started getting the jitters all that started after I stopped taking my carvedilol.  I'm thinking I need to continue taking my beta blocker as it seems is has been helping me not only with my hypertension and higher than average heart beat for being athletic, but its been helping with my anxiety as well.

Is this a sign that I should try upping my dosage to 20mg to see if I improve, or is this what they call a ""blip"" in my recovery? Thanks for any advice you can provide. "

I was on 300mgs three times a day when there were troubles with insurance, couldn't afford it and my dr could do nothing to even help me wean! Needless to say, i had no choice but to quit it all at once and WOW, I have never in my life had withdrawals like that. Lasted 2+ weeks and i suffered hot/cold flashes, sweats, tremors, fidgeting, twitching, insomnia, vomitting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, mood swings, anxiety, crying... i wanted to die. It did help with my pain but the withdrawal i experienced was insane, incredibly hard and to me, not worth it. Now, you couldn't pay me to take it or anything like it again! If something makes you feel that insanely miserable without it, then something is definitely wrong/scary/dangerous about it. Use extreme caution please! If something out of your control causes you to have no choice but to withdrawal from it, then God help you.

Even in my childhood! Here lately with added professional stress I couldn't get past what's been a constant struggle anymore and spoke to my doctor and a counselor. I had tried other meds like Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, etc in the past and had horrible experiences. After speaking with the pros they have determined that I suffer from Panic Disorder, OCD and GAD. Interestingly enough though, both my doc and counselor didn't see any depression symptoms... I'm not sure why, but I found this surprising. So my doctor suggested starting me on 5mg of the Lexapro generic to gauge my tolerance. I've taken it for 2 days now and I am experiencing increased anxiety to the point where I feel I am crawling out of my skin, nausea (most likely due to the panic I feel), and slight full body trembling (which again feels like it may be due to increased panic). Has anyone else experienced this just starting off? I am aware that I have to give it a week or two before I will start feeling better but I'm finding that I am leaning more on my Ativan than ever before. I have used Ativan intermittently for years for my panic attacks after I gave up on the Paxil's (etc). I get the .05mg and found that all I needed sometimes was half of a pill first thing in the morning here and there to take the edge off. But I am taking the whole tablet first thing in the morning and another before bed to calm my nerves. I'm prescribed the .05's for twice a day doses but I have NEVER had to actually take a whole tab 2x a day before. Am I being paranoid and it will pass or should I be concerned?

Maybe 2 times a week on average until early to mid March. I saw my doctor and she said, ""How will we know if it's working as an anti-depressant if you don't take it every day?"" So, I began taking it every day. I also have moderate to severe anxiety. Most of the time it's controllable, but I almost always have a some degree of it. Lately, I've been waking up terrified, with that gut-wrenching feeling of dread. It's been getting worse. It's to the point that I feel like I am going to go insane. I have talked to my doctor. She put me on sleeping pills as I don't sleep well. I did some research on the Adderall and it seems that it can cause anxiety or make existing anxiety worse.  I've only been on it daily for a little over a month at 10 mg. I want to know if I can go off of it without serious side-effects. "

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/i-am-at-my-wits-end-dont-know-what-to-do-513479.html,I am at my wits end. Don't know what to do?,"Some of you know me and you know about this problem. It's becoming very acute. I need something for chronic anxiety, and my doc just doesn't care. He has all these crazy rules, such as he won't write a Benzo script for more than 10 pills. Although a few months ago it was 15 pills. And way back last April he said 30 pills. I don't play with these pills, and I've never been hooked on a Benzo in my life. I never even saw a need to take a Benzo until I became 32 and developed an anxiety disorder. It has become much worse lately, and based on what is going on in my life, it's no surprise. The Doc I go to gives me 10 Ativan or Klonopin, he doesn't believe in Xanax, and when I tell him that's not enough he shakes his head as no, and says it has to be. But how can it have to be? Lately with all the things going on I need 1 every evening and often 1 in the day. That's what it takes to keep me from feeling like I'm shaking. I know many of you are on a Benzo 1, 2, and 3 times a day, and sometimes 2 mg three times a day. I doubt I need that much, but I need more than one 10 times a month. Nighttime is a very stressful time. He gave me Klonopin last Friday and these past 6 nights have been fine because I had Klonopin. But now there's almost none left, and tonight is bad. What's more the Teva Subutex I take for pain and depression is unavailable and I had to switch to Roxane. The Roxane stops wds, but it doesn't help depression which makes me more anxious. I have been doing so well on Teva Subutex these 9 months. But the past 2 nights my mind is swirling with thoughts of suicide. I know nothing can be done to get Teva Subutex, but 1 or 2 mg of Klonopin right now will stop my mind from thinking this way. I know that because I've been doing it all week. It's like the more active my mind becomes, the more nervous I get. And when I get very nervous, I think of just dying. I'm not planning it, or to do it. But just being and thinking about it makes me worse. And then I think, this is life, my life. I have no quality of life. I do what I can to change things as much as I can. Even so, I can still only do so much. But 1 pill can make me feel ok, and that will help me to press on in changing things. Except this Doc says no I can't have it. And so instead of focusing on changing things, I'm consumed with thoughts of fear and anxiety. It's a vicious cycle So I need a different Doc. But how do I get a Doc to give me a Benzo for all this anxiety? I'm 59 and I know better than anyone that walking into a Doc's office and asking for a drug means I won't get it. I don't care which Benzo they give me. But that's what works. I've tried Buspar, SSRIs, SNRI's, SSRI/SNRI's, low dose Zyprexa, the Trazodone type drugs (which I take for sleep), and may other things. This problem has been going on for 27 years. There is one family of drugs that works, and it's the Benzos. I can only afford to go to 1 new doc a month. How do I choose a doc who might give me what I need? I don't want to chose a doc at random. Any ideas? "

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/anyone-feel-seroquel-xr-takes-sanity-526380.html,Anyone else feel like seroquel xr takes your sanity?,"I am new here, but I wanted to add a comment about my experience with Seroquel XR. I have been on it for a little more then 6 months, I went from 50-100-200 and ended up stopping at the dose of 300mg. As I got used to it I had the Bad side effects, but they slowly got better. I was thinking I felt better then ever after taking every ssri, benzo's and anti seizure for mood stabilizing. I'm currently taking 6 mg of xanax a day, now 50 mg of Zoloft 40 mg of adderall and Untill a week ago 300 mg of seroquel xr. As the seroquel relieved anxiety and pretty much the rest of my problems ( panic disorder bipolar 2 depression etc.. For me) I realized that while the seroquel xr did relieve these things a lot it also changed me to the point I was no longer me. I went from being an organized and well maintained person with my children and life, to a confused, unorganized mess. Not that I didn't feel better inside, but the realization that I was completely loosing my short term memory, could no longer help my kids with homework etc, I severely became fearful of leaving my house unless I was going to see my psychiatrist, which still then I was a paranoid mess, and outside of my house was becoming delusional. I was never like this before. I have been loosing myself more and more. Everyone in my family noticed, and I was fearful of going off seroquel xr not only because I didn't want the other symptoms to return, but also the things I was reading about withdrawal. So I made the choice on my own to wean down slowly... Big mistake, the weaning down made my mind and everyday efforts 10 times worse then taking the 300 mg. so I read more and more and decided to just stop it all together. Today I have not taken the seroquel in 4 days I do have anxiety in the morning again that was gone, and also am having slight sleeping troubles, and increased depression, but I am me again. I don't feel that I can't get my thoughts together anymore, I can actually write this and know what I'm writing, and a major plus I can remember my entire day yesterday! Huge difference. I'm still a little scared that I'm not taking it, and have not informed my doc that I quit, but in my opinion seroquel was ruining my life, my mind, everything. I'm willing to suffer with my problems in exchange for my clear minded sanity. People are not thinking I'm drunk or completely out of my mind when I'm talking to them now. Not sure what I'll do if I go on another med, but I will never take an anti psychotic again..benefits do not outway the harm it was doing to my sanity. I have been on everything possible over the last 18 years. Ups and downs and all over the place severe panic attacks fears and so on. I think I'm out of options, and that's why I don't want my doc to know I'm off seroquel. With everything I have to feel and stress over and severe anxiety and depression, at least as of this moment, I can actually deal with these things with a thought, that seroquel had taken away from me. I don't know about others and I'm not sure what to do in my situation, all I do know right now is that how I'm feeling my 4 th day off seroquel is I am becoming me again, enjoying things that couldn't have matter one bit on seroquel and thinking clearly and remembering things is the best feeling in the world!

Since I was very young I have always been an incredibly light eater, I was basically fed off of Pediasure until I was around 6. I'm 6 feet and weigh only 120 pounds, putting myself at the very low percentile for my age and height group. I believe the reason I have such a low appetite is because of my anxiety, during the school year I can expect my weight to drop to as little as 113. I've tried Ciplactin and other appetite stimulants and have never been able to get hungry off of them. The only thing that really works I find is cannabis, but I'd rather not have to smoke to eat food. Anyway, that was the background information. I spoke to my doctor about my weight and my anxiety and after several blood tests (thyroid, renal, and some other one- which all came out normal) he prescribed me with a small starter dose of Citalopram (10mg) and plans to increase it if it works out well. The day I took it it was instantly like a laxative and I have already dropped seven pounds because of the nausea it has given me. Not only that but my anxiety has actually increased, I can barely stomach food. From what I understand Citalopram should actually increase my appetite, because I would have less anxiety. This hasn't happened yet. Has this situation happened with anyone else? Extreme weight loss with beginning Citalopram? Will my appetite return once I've reached the therapeutic amount? I'm desperate to gain weight and I would appreciate ANY input from anyone who has found a solution for their appetite/anxiety problems. Thank you. "

Is it nuts to try again?","I have generalized anxiety, which has in turned really caused a lot of my depression. I initially tried lexapro, as it's worked for friends of mine, but found that even with tapering onto it slowly and adjusting my timing with the dosing, the onset has me EXTREMELY frightened, anxious- it was a worse hell than I was already in. This symptom seem to worsen as time went on, not get better. My main question to those who went through this: Should I have toughed it out, or was this a sign the medication was NOT for me? I am now 5 weeks in to bupropion, and experiencing minimal results. From what I have researched, bupropion can take 2 months and even more to show benefits. I may be jumping the gun a bit, but I may be someone who needs a combo therapy. Bupropion seems to be good for depression, but being that I deal with somatization and anxiety, my research keeps pointing me back to lexapro as my best option. I am in a better place emotionally than where I was when I first started lexapro. I am also NOT considering starting now at only 5 weeks in on the bupropion, but rather at the 10 week or so point to really give this one a shot all on it's own.

He prescribed Duloxetine (generic Cymbalta). I just started taking it at home last week on my 3 days off. The first week is 20 mg./day with a 10 mg./day increase every week until I reach 60 mg./day. First day I had stomach issues but then realized I had eaten something with milk in it. That could have accounted for the gut upset. Next day guts were OK. I felt slightly dizzy/spacey and tired but could handle that. I noticed my pupils were dilated, giving me the appearance of being ""high"". That was not troublesome.  What I found upsetting was I felt devoid or detached of my emotions. In a situation that I would normally get tearful or cry, I couldn't get an emotional reaction. This was frightening. I felt like my body and mind were in one spot and my emotions in another area. I was unable to connect with them. I kind of felt half human. (Remember Star Trek-the Vulcans had no emotions? Kind of like Mr. Spock.)  The list of side effects are enough to scare you to death and I don't like what I've read about the ""withdrawal"" when you taper off (to discontinue taking it) either. My ""shrink"" says he'd like me to take it for a year, then taper off over 6 months. I'm having serious reservations about getting started on this drug. I believe my anxiety is situational due to life circumstances. I have 5 years before I can retire. I believe that, once these ""situations"" are no longer present, I will be able to manage whatever anxiety I have. I am also in talk therapy.

Fibromyalgia,https://www.drugs.com/answers/tramadol-aggressive-behaviour-3192720.html,Tramadol and aggressive behaviour?,"Hello, my diabetic husband being treated for depression (GAD), anxiety, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, mental illness including the personality disorders: BPD and Avoidant Personality Disorder; and fibromyalgia was on the maximum dose (UK) for tramadol to manage the pain associated with fibromyalgia. He did this against my will, but ultimately that was his choice. He became impotent, lethargic, and increasingly agitated and more verbally abusive nasty/cruel etc than had been his normal personality. Has anyone else experienced esp. the aggressive behaviours in patients using the drug Tramadol? Any information will be hugely appreciated, as I am still struggling to understand what happened to my now ex-husband who refused to accept how belligerent he became. Thank you "
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/getting-off-klonopin-345812.html,Getting off Klonopin?,"My doctor has had me on .5 mg 2x a day of Klonopin for Generalized Anxiety Disorder for about 45 days now. While the medication seems to be helping, I don't like some of the side-effects (had a rather bad case of aggression and depression today) and am worried about becoming dependent and going through a long and unpleasant withdrawal down the road. Is 45 days at 1 mg per day long enough to have become physically dependent? I would like to try a half dose for about a week, then stop completely from there, but I am worried about some of the more major side effects (like seizures). My doctor is a hard man to get a hold of, so I'd rather try to get off the meds myself, but I'm not sure if a longer titration schedule would be more appropriate. Additionally, my anxiety is more situational based (dates, parties, speeches, etc.). Can I take the Klonopin on an ""as needed"" basis? Should I maybe look into Xanax or Xanax XR as a possible substitute to use 1-3 times per week as needed? Any thoughts would be appreciated. "

Fibromyalgia,https://www.drugs.com/answers/i-have-recently-been-diagnosed-with-cyclothymia-441325.html,I have recently been diagnosed with cyclothymia and ADD and have questions regarding meds/treatment?,"I am on several medications right now due to having fibromyalgia and anxiety issues. And when I run what I currently am on through the drugs.com interaction check, none of the primary medications for ADD (ritalin, adderall, concerta, vyvanse... ) pose any threat or harmful interaction at all with my med load. The shrink I am seeing however is refusing to treat my ADD because she feels my pain medication is sedating me and the reason for my distraction and forgetfullness (nevermind the fact I have been struggling with every ADD symptom since childhood and my pyschologist, that is on staff in this cooperative office, is emphatic that I need to be treated for my ADD).  My primary care physician is appauled that this pyschiatrist is refusing to treat my ADD due to clear bias, and only treating the bipolar issues with lamictal. She has even offered to take over treatment if this does not turn around. Has anyone else had such bias/prejudice against them for being treated for a coexisiting-pre-existing condition while trying to get help? I actually had first asked about using T3 thryoid hormone after doing a lot of research about how this may be affecting my cyclothymia and ADD symptoms, but the shrink said that was a LAST resort treamtent.  After this, the only other medications I suggested we discuss were either wellbutrin or vyvanse- yet she is unwilling to even discuss these with me, compairing me wanting stimulant therapy with her patients who want to smoke pot while asking for adderall.  So... I guess what I am asking is- has anyone successfully resolved such issues inside a medical office, or did they have to find another doctor to get treatment from? Also- has anyone had experiences with treating comorbid ADD and mild bipolar and what medications seemed to work best? I am still seeing the shrink at the moment and the counsellor for the cognetive part of therapy. I am doing what I can to help myself in this talk therapy dept, but I know I need some kind of medical intervention if I want to have any real ability to hold a job, let alone a chain of coherant thought and keep my family from continuing to judge me as some hypochondriac, lazy, unambitious person who if I could just get my act together, would amount to something. All I need to do is try harder right?! Sigh...  Between my chronic pain, mental aggrivations and constant distraction I really feel like I am a basket case, desperate for help! I want to have a productive life and feel like I am spinning my wheels begging for someone to help me untangle this knot. I have been treated by so many docs for so many years and only recently have come closer to putting the pieces together. Now I just need the proper tools to get a stronger grip on balancing my life.  As a side note, the lamictal has gretly improved the aggitation, inner tension and even my TMJ. I am feeling more focused and a bit more energy and less anxiety- but this is a far cry from where I need to be to function fully.  While I know that all medications are different and it's very trial and error for each person, my pharmacist was also very in support of using vyvanse in my particular situation, knowing my history. She said the lamitical and vyvanse are cooperative and could help me a great deal. But if I was wanting to help with depression more, then the wellbutrin was also potentially a good choice. Would love some imput, or shared stories of experiences.  Any suggestions on how to handle such a complicated medical office situation as well as recommendations on treating comorbid ADD and bipolar (books, websites, medications?) all would be very appreciated!

My doctor is changing my class of drug since the current class I take has no affect on my depression. I currently take celexa, but I have tried Paxil, Zoloft & now the Celexa did seem 2 be working, but as of now it stopped working, just like the Zoloft did. I was also on Lamactil before I started having a reaction in my mouth from it! I read that lots of people who are depressed or suffer from Bipolar also need a mood stabilizer & I know that the Lamactil was the mood stabilizer for me. I would like to hear what u guys have experienced or some comments, suggestions, views or advice, etc. I would appreciate all your help or comments, etc.  Anyhoo... I go 2 see my Pdoc in 2days & I am trying to hold on cuz my depression is not better & I am on the highest dose of Celexa! I am hoping that I don't need to try 2many & I hope I don't need 2 take a large quantity of pills to feel normal! I was wondering... when/if you change from SSRI to SNRI meds, do you need to wean off the SSRIs as you start the SSNRI meds? I am anxious to know that, cuz I cannot wait 2 ask my doc, since it is in 2 more days, I am frantic to know! LOL! Also, I noticed that the SSRI class of antidepressants has more selections of medications than the SSNRI meds? I wonder y? Anyhoo, just wanted to see what u guys have done or tried between the 2! I have resistant depression & that sucks! Plus, I want to try Effexor cuz I researched it & it seem 2 be something I would wanna try! It has a generic & I heard positive & negatives about it, but... oh well! Also, I see the newer SSNRIs do not have generics! That sucks, cuz I am reaping the wreckage of my past!. I noticed that Pristiq, Cymbalta & Abilify do not have generics yet. But anyway, guys, if you can tell me what your experiences have been 2 change from one class to another class of drugs I would appreciate it dearly! Also, I am anxious to see what actually might work for me. Thanks to you all for any help, suggestions, responses or ideas that you can or will provide! God Bless u all & Good luck to you! "

After about 15 minutes I began getting a different headache, nausea, my heart seemed to speed and even jump a couple times, my abdomen and back were killing me (I have degenerative disease) and I felt like I wasn't getting oxygen. I got up to go throw up and fell, which I have done 3 times prior in a month because my sciatica is bothering me (my Doctor is aware and is ordering an MRI). I don't know if it was the sciatica or something else but it took about 10 minutes before I could get my equilibrium back and walk. Since then I have been ill with stomach problems, diarrhea, tightness in my chest, headaches, chronic fatigue, nausea and bad balance. Many of these things I have had off and on because of my med's but this is different. I talked to a pulmonary person and the American Lung Association because I thought it may have been my oxygen. I was told occasionally you can get a bad bottle or that it's possible to get oxygen toxicity (similar to the bends) but that wasn't likely. Today I looked up the side effects of my Metronidazole Cream and found if it was pill form it could explain almost every symptom.

Finally after 2 weeks of misery I had some answers, a positive Lyme test and viral meningiris. A few days later I developed Bells Palsy. So the Lyme had clearly entered my brain. I was started on IV rocephin which I took for 3 weeks and 12 days of prednisone (40 mg for 7 days, 20 mg for 3 days and 10 mg for 2 days). I felt better for about a week. Then I developed more head and neck pain, fatigue and shortness of breath. This came on the day after I finished the prednisone. When I called the doctor about it, I asked if it could be related to the discontinuation of prednisone and she said it was unlikely and gave me one more week of IV rocephin. What makes this difficult is these symptoms could be related to ongoing Lyme effect or possibly Prednisone withdrawal. After three weeks of suffering with terrible head and neck pain and shortness of breath I went back to my primary doctor today in tears (I had been seeing an infectious disease doctor). She said the symptoms I am having could be related to many things: A coinfection from the Lyme (awaiting blood work on anaplasmosis and Babesia... although false negatives are common) Ongoing Lyme effect that could take months to resolve Prednisone withdrawal Spinal headache resulting from lumbar puncture I had over a month ago.  The doctor wants to put me back on prednisone and taper me more slowly. I am afraid to be put back on it. I have already suffered through three weeks of possible withdrawal. Maybe I am about to come out on the other side of withdrawl. Do I want to start all over at 40 mg?  She also said if I don't feel better once we get me back on the presdnisone she would do a repeat MRI and look for a csf leak that may be causing the headaches.  I am just desperate to feel better. I am paying out of pocket to see a MD who specialize in lyme next week.  I have 5 kids age 4-15, two newly adopted, and I can barely get out of bed.

Well, I ran out, it seemed like I went into instant withdrawl, so my mom has to get 10mg Valium 30/mth w/ her Pain pills[ she has Multiple Sclrosis] and she dose not take her Valium 10mg b/c it knocks her out, so I have been takind 2-3 10 mg Valium, and I am on day 2 [w/out any xanax] I have a stomach ulcer[ probably from all the pills I have taken] and when I ran out of my Xanax [ I honestly think someone got into my supply, b/c I would give my Mom about 5 Xanax a week to help her anxiety, and I think she may of gotten into my bottle, or I would not of ran out, and I know I had 37 left when I went to spend the night , due to 1 of her M.S. flare ups, and the next am, my Vanax bottle had 8 left! So, she gave me 20 of the 30 Valium she gets, I have been taking 2 10mg Valium, and they take the edge off, but that is it, I feel so Dope sick, it is unreal.

But I have to have something for my severe anxiety issue, I heard that Kolonipn 2mg is the best choice of the 3 [Xanax, Valium, Klonopin]] I also read some other post on another website, and there was a guy that posted he had been on Xanax 2mg for 12 yrs, and they have a fast acting resonse, but leave ur body quickly, so that is why he was taking 6-8/day, then went to Klonopin 2mg, then the Valium 10mg is what he chose b/c it stays in ur system alot longer than Xanax, but I am trying to think about how much longer will I feel 'Dope sick' from cold turkey Xanax, and what other 1 I am going to choose before I go back to my Psychatrist. I do need 1 of the 3, but I know how Xanax works, it dose come on fast, and it leaves fast, and the withdrawls I have been experiancing is not at all fun, That guy that posted about how he took all 3, and decided to stick w/ Valium10 mg b/c it works best, but a aquantance of mine that was taking alot of Vanax was switched to Kolonapin 2mg. said that they keep u from Sezing, but they r not like Xanax at all, so if u have tooken Xanax, and got off of them b/c of the worst withdrawl symptoms, what do you suggest I take [since I have never took Kolonpin, I have no clue as to how it works..I just want to know 1. How long dose it take to get better from the withdrawls from Xanax? 2. Out of the other 2 Valium 10mg, & Kolonpin 2mg, which 1 do u think I should switch too? [I do not ever want to experiance withdrawls like ths ever again] I need ur help if u have taken Xanax ,like me, which 1 should I ask my Psychiotrist to switch me too?

Since upping my dose of Wellbutrin to 300mg I have been feeling extremely anxious. I am constantly flushed, sweating, shaking, and nervous. I had a panic attack this week and that is very rare for me. I don't even notice the Propranolol helping with anxiety at this point.

I increased to 20 mg a few days ago on doctors orders and am still waiting for the ""good feelings"" to come. I keep expecting to feel the way I did on Paxil but it is not happening.

I have been on 20 mg of Lexapro for about 1 year. I went on it at a challenging time in my life due to anxiety, teeth clenching and insomnia. The teeth clenching and insomnia got better, the anxiety may have slightly improved--- it's hard to tell. Recently my financial situation changed. I can no longer afford my 10 minute appointments with my psychiatrist that cost over $200 and I also could not afford the $120/month prescription. $320/month for the meds in addition to $400 a month for my therapist=WAY too much money for a struggling small business owner. Anyway, because I can not afford my psychiatrist's appointment, he prescribed me 30 days of pills and told me to find another doctor. He will not write me another prescription, or give me pills with a smaller dosage. Because I am also recently uninsured, I do not have a doctor that I can afford so I have 30 20mg pills to taper off of this drug. I am tapering as slow as possible, knowing that I have a limited number of pills. I took 10 mg for 2 weeks. It was rough. I took 5 mg for 2 weeks. It was horrible. Currently I am cutting my pills into 8ths (approximately) and I am completely miserable.  The symptoms are the same as everyone else. I am dizzy, with brain zaps, stomach aches, exhaustion, and I am completely incapable of concentrating. The worst thing though is the depression. I have never been depressed before, but now haven't laughed in at least 3 weeks. I am entirely impatient, unreasonable, apathetic and cruel. I can not control myself in the slightest. I cannot be around other people. I cry easily when I don't have a reason to cry. I don't have any reaction when I should cry.

Positive responses please. I started Lexapro about 20 days ago at 5mg.

I felt the best I ever had in my?,"... life. Something recently happened and I got depression / anxiety. Have had the anxiety with stomach aches and feeling very nervous, crying spells to relieve the tense pressure, for 5 1/2 months. My doctor had me take lexapro 10 mg, 15mg , 20mg. With no help. Now I've been on effexor xr 75 mg, 150 mg and now on 225 mg for 5 days. When I increased to the 225mg the anxiety stomach ache stopped for 4 days and then came back. My doctor wants me to also take .5 mg klonopin. 4x a day while we are trying to get an antidepressant that helps with anxiety to work.

I was on celexa for a year at 40 mg for depression & anxiety. At first it was amazing, but then it felt like it wasn't really helping me anymore and it had made me gain a LOT of weight while I was on it. I went to see my dr. about switching to something else and it turned out that she was on maternity leave and i had to see someone new. I could tell that the new dr. seemed really skeptical of antidepressants in general. She switched me to wellbutrin at 100 mg. a day. I'm off the celexa for a month now and have been taking the wellbutrin for three weeks. At first I noticed a difference that I had a lot more energy and could complete day to day tasks much easier (I washed my hair! A+ gold star!) but it's so subtle that I don't really notice anything at all now. I started trying to research dosages, and if I understand correctly, she put me on a REALLY low dosage rate.

Eye Conditions,https://www.drugs.com/answers/serious-withdrawal-symptoms-abrupt-stop-1074205.html,Serious withdrawal symptoms from abrupt stopping of doxycycline?,"I have been taking 100 mg of doxycycline once a day since last August. It was prescribed for a case of perioral dermatitis so bad that it had creeped up between my eyes before I sought treatment. Not only did it get rid of the dermatitis, it also cleared up my acne to the point that my skin was gorgeous! During my follow up with my dermatologist, I asked if I could continue using it for awhile because of the amazing job it was doing for my skin. Last Monday, May 5th, I called my pharmacy for a refill. Since there were no refills left, they had to contact my dermatologist for authorization. The doctor's office has yet to refill it. The pharmacy has sent two requests. Just a couple of days after taking my last tablet, I began feeling depressed, anxious, jittery, and started hearing little clicking noises in my right ear (like a watch ticking) that would last only a couple of seconds but would happen many times a day. I noticed my breathing became shallow, like I had to remember to take a breath. I could feel body ticks on my mattress before falling asleep. I also had insomnia and loss of appetite and heartburn when I did eat. I felt so fragile emotionally that I considered going to the hospital. I also started having UTI symptoms, such as frequency, burning, and urgency with very little output of urine. I thought that, since Doxy is sometimes prescribed for UTIs, maybe I was getting one from stopping the drug. I have also been running a high fever (over 101° in the evenings), sweats, headache, back pain, and just a general sense of feeling crappy. I spoke to my daughter about it over the weekend because she is a medical assistant. She did a urinalysis for me this morning that didn't show bacteria but did show a little blood. She faxed the results to my family doctor, and I followed up with an email describing my symptoms. I'm not sure how all this fits together. I am very put out with my dermatologist for dropping the ball if, in fact, you can suffer severe withdrawal from Doxy. If it can happen, I fully intend on making them aware of it so that it doesn't happen to any other patient of theirs. Seems to me that this may have happened a long time ago when my pharmacy requested them to fill an Rx for me. Rather than contacting the pharmacy to let them know they wouldn't fill it until I made another appointment, they didn't do anything. I didn't find out what was going on until I called them myself. It's a pretty crappy way to treat a patient. I want all the factual information I need before calling them about what I've gone through the last week or so due to the poor handling of my health. I won't go back there, and I won't take Doxy anymore. Thanks so much for your help! "

My anxiety was making me only want to stay home, I felt anxious and shaky, and always felt cold. I couldn't eat, because every time I put food in my mouth my throat felt like it was closing. The only way I could eat was if I chewed slowly and paced myself. Since I wasn't eating much it gave me IBS and constipation for a few days after. I felt miserable and depressed and all I wanted to do was sleep so I didn't feel it, but I still looked/felt exhausted. I first had this bad anxiety about a year ago. I had it for three months, and it went away. About 3 weeks ago it came back and took a toll on me. It seems to come around when there is a romantic relationship coming into my life. My mom thinks it's because I've lost so many family members in the past 7 years, me losing my father to cancer first.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/problems-back-lexapro-after-switching-celexa-2-834255.html,Having problems getting back on lexapro after switching to celexa for 2 weeks. Help please!?,"Hi all. I'm a young mom to 2 small children. I've always had anxiety, but after having my first baby in 2009 I had horrible postpartum anxiety and was put on Lexapro. The start up was horrible, I even had moments of suicidal thoughts, and worsening depression (though I didn't have much depression in the first place) but my psychiatrist at the time told me to give it more time and it will start working soon. She was right, and it did start working around 8 weeks. From then on I was a very happy, anxiety free mommy! I felt so great that when my son Was a year and a half old, we wanted another baby so with my drs help I attempted to wean off. I went down to 15mg a day to start and by the 5th day I was starting to feel lousy and depressed. It felt like I was starting up again with the depression that, again, I've never experienced before Lexapro before so either it's something that came on naturally after starting it (depression runs in my distant family) or the lexapro itself is causing it when it's not stable in my system.  Anyway, as soon as I started feeling it I didn't care, I wanted it to go away so I started back to 20 mg and my dr was ok with this. It took me a few weeks to feel back to my happy self. Now because of this, I've been very afraid of trying to get off again. And honestly I liked the person I was while on it, so I was fine with staying on it. Until my husband got out of the military and we lost our insurance. Before this, I had a healthy pregnancy and postpartum experience while still on my lexapro. I even switched from the name brand to the generic that came out while I was pregnant still and had absolutely no issues.  Fast forward about a ear after having my daughter and being totally happy and fine, that's when we lost our insurance and a different dr (not the psychiatrist is been seeing for 4 years) told me to switch to the generic of celexa because it's the same drug but much more affordable. So 4 days after we moved to a completely new area so my husband could go to school, I ran out of my lexapro and had to start the celexa. An hour after taking it I immediately felt a difference in my head. I had this pressure feeling and heightened anxiety.  I kept going tho, cause $4 for this med. compared to $165 for the lexapro generic was worth the trial. Let's just say within 2 weeks I was a mess. I lost all motivation, had a horrible time thinking clearly, couldn't focus on anything. Then at the end if the 2 week mark I started crying uncontrollably over nothing! I was so emotional and sad. I thought for sure it was the celexa not working for me, so I called my old psychiatrist and she sent in a prescription for lexapro generic again for me.  I started it, at 20 mg (I was on 40mg of celexa) my usual dose and I ended up having the most unbearable start up symptoms ever. I could hardly get thru the day, doing anything was damn near painful! And the morning anxiety was disgusting! I didn't want to do anything. I wasn't suicidal, but I had moments of not even wanting to be a mom anymore. And this time I have no dr to go to for help! But I knew it should pass, and after a week it did get better. And as more weeks went by, I got better and better! Started feeling much better and like y old self around 6 weeks. And then 8 weeks I noticed a tiny decline. And then right after noticing that, my husbands family had issues resulting in Us having to take in his 16 year old brother. And that stressor really hit me hard and I think set my recovery back because all of a sudden my anxiety was back and so was some of my depression.  It's been a few days since that and I had a few bad days of feeling sadness, some anxiety. And now today? I feel almost nothing. In fact, I feel like I'm high. I don't care about anything, have no drive or motivation to do anything. I am scared.  Someone tell me what to do! I can't afford a psychiatrist and I can't see a low income dr until the middle of next month! I want my old self back!!  Should I try to get off it? I'm scared of doing that because of what happened the first time and I've been on it since becoming a mom and in afraid I will all of a sudden not love my children or something. I also really don't want to without a dr's guidance. I'm so scared! "
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/afraid-start-taking-zoloft-advice-831355.html,"Im afraid to start taking Zoloft, need some advice?","I got prescribed Xanax in September for my really bad anxiety, to the point where I wouldn't leave the house for a week. My doctors don't want me on Xanax anymore so they gave me zoloft to try and I'm supposed to start it and ween off Xanax. (Smallest dose of Xanax .25. I take one at night that's it) and I got the smallest dose of Zoloft. I've been putting off taking the Zoloft because next week (thanksgiving break) my boyfriend comes home from school and I want to enjoy my time with him, and I know that a lot of anti depressants can cause you to lose your sex drive in the first month or even longer while on it. I'm debating waiting until after thanksgiving to start it, or does it take a few weeks for those effects to happen so would I be fine if I started it today? I just don't want him to come home and me be a wreck especially during sex. Just wondering if I break it in half and take 12.5 will that lessen the chances of the bad side effects. When I tried lexapro a month ago I had the worst panic attack of my life, that's why I stopped it. I want this one to work but I'm so scared "
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/question-zoloft-sertraline-823575.html,Question about Zoloft (Sertraline)?,"I was diagnosed with GAD and given Mirtazapine. I took that for almost 2 months (no other med) ending at 30 mg for 18 days. Toward the end of the 18 days, I felt more anxious. I was told by my GP to give it more time, but I felt I needed something else.  She suggested a switch to lexapro. I took tjat for 8 days at 10 mg, but had a very bad experience with it. I was told to stop at day 8. My GP then recommended a psych as she felt this was not her field of expertise. In the meantime, I was given klonopin to help during the day, with only 15 mg of mirtazapine at bedtime (to help with appetite and sleep, I had lost 15 lbs in the two months prior to these meds, so gaining weight was one of my goals. This regimen lasted for about 4-5 weeks. Last week, I finally got into a psych. He told me to keep up with the mirtazapine and klonopin (i should say i take 0.25 mg klon BID). He told me if need be, i could add a third 0.25 mg of klon at bedtime. I have not yet done that. I tend to be more relaxed at bedtime with the mirtazapine, so I did not feel a need to take more klon at that time.  My psych feels the mirtazapine was not effective for my anxiety (based on 18 days at 30 mg) He says the energizing feeling I was getting would be great for depression, but not helpful for anxiety (this is my problem). he also says I could treat my anxiety with klon only. But this would be a bit more dangerous over a long period of time. Hence, the reason he added an SSRI.  My psych has added (Zoloft) sertraline starting at 12.5 mg, to move up to 25 mg in a week, then 50 mg a week after that. I tend to be very sensitive to meds it seems. It is hard for me to believe that 12.5 mg of zoloft would have much of any effect. But it tends to make me a bit tired for about 2 hours after taking it, then about 5-6 hour after taking it I feel like I just drank a pot of coffee.  Very jittery, shaky, odd bowel feelings. Today is my 5th day of taking 12.5 mg. Last night about 5-6 hours after taking it, I felt very odd. I do not want to say I felt like passing out, but it felt like I was heading in that direction. I never passed out on Lexapro, just terrible nausea where i could not move at all, and upset stomach with diarrhea all day, every day. I also had a strange warm sensation moving thru my body with the lexapro. These things started on Day 2 of lexapro. With the Zoloft, I have not had anything like that so far. Which is a good sign. But I am also concerned why I would be getting some of these SE's on such a low dose.  I am med phobic. I tend to think these pills make you worse, not better. I have no reason to believe that. It is just one of my fears. So I tend to pay attention to EVERY feeling in my body and attribute it to the pill.  So my question is, does anyone have these SE's on only 12.5 mg of Zoloft? Or, is this my anxiety about taking these pills that is causing my problems? I get so nervous about taking them my stomach is in knots. This effects my ability to eat or have an appetite, which fuels my fear about losing the weight I have managed to gain back this past month. Also, my anxiety over taking the zoloft (or the zoloft itself) has seemed to negate any benefit I was getting from the klonopin. Now, I am only taking 0.25 mg klonopin at a time. Is this dose enough to have an impact on anxiety?  My psych says he wants me calmed way down, even if that means taking an additional .25 mg of klon a day.  the goal is to get me to Zoloft only, with no need for mirtazapine or klonopin at all. sounds great, but seems so far away right now it is hard to imagine it happening.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/bupropion-wellbutrin-ruminative-thinking-1212790.html,Bupropion - How is Wellbutrin for ruminative thinking?,"I was diagnosed about 3 months ago with ADD and GAD. I started out on 5 mg of Adderall and it has been immediately life-changing: more energy, more ability to focus and stay on task, much less anxious, not as easily distracted, improved short-term memory, and much more emotionally balanced with my kids--no more angry flare ups on my end. Seriously amazing results.  However, I still have a persistent underlying feeling of sadness. It's not debilitating depression or an existential melancholy, but a mild sadness, like an empty nest or ""day after the ball"" feeling. My doctor was torn between adding either Wellbutrin or an SSRI, but opted for Wellbutrin, since I was describing sadness as opposed to anxiety.  What I neglected to discuss with my doc in this last appointment was how prone to rumination and perfectionism I am. I'll receive an email from someone, and turn it over in my head over and over, analyzing every word for tone and subtext. I'll send lengthy emails and then re-read them several times throughout the day. If I don't ""close the loop"" on a conversation, I will obsess about it, waiting for a reply ... and then obsessing that I haven't received a reply and creating stories as to why. I often connect-the-dots and come to conclusions that end up being completely wrong.  So my question is ... does Wellbutrin generally tend to help with rumination as well? "

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/reinstating-lexapro-advice-required-dosage-3069650.html,"Reinstating Lexapro - advice required, dosage recommendations, similar experiences, success stories?","Up until about 6 weeks ago I’d been on Lexapro off and on for around 7 years. I’d been on various strengths, mostly around 10mg and 5mg but had a period last year of being on 20mg. In between times I also spent a few months taking mirtazapine and about 10 months on Prozac. Being relatively stable for nearly a year, I thought the time was right to say goodbye to these meds. My sex drive was little to none and weight gain was a problem too. I tapered from 20mg to 15, to 10mg ,to 5mg over the course of a few months, then to 5mg every other day for about a month. After stopping completely (about 6 weeks ago) I began taking 5-htp as I’d heard this was effective for countering the withdrawal. I’ve been taking vitamin B complex, vitamin D, Omega 3 and magnesium for years. However, about two weeks ago I started to crash badly. Crying, depressed, very anxious, feelings of guilt consuming me, etc. I went to the doctor and he suggested reinstating the Lexapro at 10mg. So, for the last 9 days I’ve been back on it at 10mg. Initially it was OK and I felt a bit better but these last couple of days have been hell again for me. I have since read that reinstating might not work (but generally, the longer you leave it, the less likely it is to work and being I only left it 5 weeks I was hopeful of it being a success). I also read that reinstating should be done at a low dose before ramping back up. Therefore, today I’ve only taken 5mg.  My questions are: are these horrible feeling my brain just readjusting to the Lexapro and is it right to reinstate at a lesser dose (i.e. the 5mg rather than the 10mg for a period)?  Any similar experiences, success stories, advice, etc. would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks "

I am not someone who takes medicine often, I didn't even take things like Advil or Motrin until the end of high school, and I am not a drinker so I don't know if that is the problem. She prescribed me the 10mg lexapro dose and the very first day I was extremely dizzy and nauseous, I figured I just needed to adjust so the second day I took the regular dose again; this time I was not only dizzy and nauseous but I slept through the entire day. Day three I again took 10mg still thinking I needed to adjust and I was so dizzy and nauseous that I threw up (i've only thrown up one other time in my entire life) and my muscles started having spasms and I got so hot, this caused some alarm for me so day four I only took 5mg and I was still very sick but a little better. Then instead of waiting 24 hours to take it again I waited 36 and still only took 5mg, but again I was very sick.

I had been under the care of very well known and trusted psychiatrist. Unfortunately, he has retired, I recently lost my job and am currently going to a free clinic for my healthcare. Another unfortunate is this clinic is horrible, and their knowledge of meds is basically based on google.com. I'm hopeful that someone can help me with my question. I have been tapering myself off of both meds successfully (due to the fact that my anxiety isn't as severe). I've been more careful with xanax because I know of the risks involved.

For the first time in many years, I started having great anxiety again. I'm pretty sure the anxiety is caused by the health issues with my stomach. Have had several doctor visits, and just this last week they finally drew blood for lab work. I started taking Passion Flower Extract, capsule form, about 30 days ago.

Before starting the Passion Flower, I could not leave my house. Now I can go to the store, but have to have someone with me at all times. At the last visit with doctor, I was prescribed Celexa, or Citalopram. The doctor highly recommended I get ahold of the anxiety before going further with testing for the stomach issues. So my question is, are there any known negative or positive interactions with Passion Flower and Citalopram? I am hesitant to stop the Passion Flower as it has helped somewhat, and I think it takes anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks for herbal supplements to show. Thank you so much for a place to write my question!

I also have agoraphobia (which I didn't always have) that makes it VERY hard to even leave my front door... In order to leave the house, I have to take at least 4 mgs of Ativan at once. I've told my psychiatrist this, but he doesn't want to keep upping my dosage... Neither do I.

While on Claritin I become temperamental and foggy. This includes mood swings, depression, weakness, sleepiness, paranoia and missing time. By missing time I mean I do not always feel conscious while on the medication.  Example: I yelled at someone and suddenly became aware I was yelling for a most ridiculous reason. I'm not sure how long I had been yelling before becoming aware of myself. There have been many moments like these for me while on Claritin. I reduced to half the dosage and they rarely occur now.  When I do NOT take the Claritin I do NOT have these moments NOR the other symptoms but then my allergies are so bad it's unbearable.  I feel depressed and overwhelmed while using the Claritin and cry several times a week. My husband is quite aware of the mood swings and other changes but has been patient thankfully. I've read very few comments about regular Claritin and depression or mood swings and psychological changes but the few I read made me realize I may not be alone in this.  I tend to be extremely sensitive to medications needing to take children's dosages to avoid bad reactions. Even children's zyrtec makes me pass out within one hour of taking it. By pass out I don't mean I get up and go to bed. I mean I seriously begin falling towards the couch pillows without a choice and sleep for 10 hours.

Depression,https://www.drugs.com/answers/my-wellbutrin-seems-to-be-making-me-more-172098.html,My Wellbutrin seems to be making me more depressed! HELP?,"I am 25 years old & have had depression for years, probably on & off since I was 11 or so. It became very apparent when my mom died 4 years ago (of the same cancer that killed my dad when I was 12). I started taking Celexa that same year when my mom was diagnosed. She (and my older brother) both suffer(ed) from depression & needed meds. Before going to the doctor & learning of my ""chemical imbalance,"" I couldn't even go to work, I lost 2 good jobs in a row & the Celexa completely saved my life. I was only on 20mg a day for about 4 years & then I moved, got an awesome job, became blissfully distracted & stopped taking them altogether. I was amazed with how well I could function without anti-depressants & refused to get back on my Celexa & go back to all those sexual side affects & weight gain... no way! But in the past several weeks, I have had many, many total melt-downs; crying hysterically & having such intense fits of anger I have put holes in walls & torn down the metal towel rack in the bathroom! (What I really wanted to do was smash my fists into the mirror.) I get so upset/cry so hard for so long, I literally can't breathe. My husband & best friend are the only people on the planet who know I'm anything other than bubbly, outgoing, happy as can be--total social butterfly. It's so hard to pretend you're on top of the world everyday when you feel like there's nothing to live for. So I started taking Wellbutrin after a doctor told me it would increase my sex drive & may even take off a few pounds. Both have proven to be true already, but I don't know if I can get over ""the hump."" The first 4 or 5 days were great--tons of energy, happy as could be, super productive, but now after 10 days, I am absolutely miserable, more depressed than I've been in a LONG time. Constantly crying, feeling totally empty, worthless, alone & my stomach's sick with grief. I spent the whole first hour of work today trying to hide my tears, running to the bathroom when I couldn't hide them anymore. The worst part is that I don't think I can ever come clean to my boss or co-workers... not only do they totally not get depression in general, but they'd never even believe someone as happy & wonderful as me could possibly need meds. I am so afraid I will lose my job, (which would cause 100 times more stress than I'm under now) I think about going back to no pills at all, but I really want to give these a try. (I know I need something.) I am still only taking the dosage for the initial week, 150 mg/day (1 pill) because I'm afraid to go to the 2 pills & make things doubly worse. Or do I need a higher dose? I'd love to stick it out & see, but I don't know if I can. I can't even afford to go to the doctor & talk about what's happening or try something different. Just spillin' my guts made me feel a little better for tonight though. :) "

I swallow it all the time. I said .. there is alcohol in it and also toxic ingredients. He is very picky about foods he eats and tastes and I was shocked he could swallow it. He said it's fine and he's always done it. Am I wrong to think #1 he is getting a buzz doing this a few times a day and also could be a factor in the ""diabetes"" control and alcohol issue.

I had a severe accident 2yrs ago and was prescribed Tramadol 200mg SR. Since taking this medication I have stopped drinking and have no desire to even touch a drink I feel happy and enjoy life. I have now realized that I was depressed all of my life and was self medicating with alcohol. I believe Tramadol has been a miracle drug for me and works as an antidepressant. The only problem is that in Australia Tramadol is prescribed for pain and not an anti depressant. So Would anyone possibly know if their are any similar antidepressants to the antidepressant qualities in tramadol. Because I would love a permanent prescription to an antidepressant. that works the same way.? Because I love sobriety and wish to have a family and I never want to drink again. Also I believe Tramadol has saved my life, my liver scores were through the roof and a surgeon said to me once that if I keep drinking I would need a liver replacement soon. Since taking Tramadol and feeling happier and having no desire to drink, my liver scores have halfed and are coming back to normal. So which anti-depressant would be similar to tramadol? or other drugs for this reason? Thank you I appreciated your tme and looking forward to hearing from you. "

Intense feelings never felt before taking this medication?,"I have been previously diagnosed (for years) with depression and anxiety and have been on various meds for them, some helping better than others, although I never found the right one.  I recently saw a new psychologist who diagnosed me with bipolar (somewhat out of the blue) after meeting with me for about ten minutes. He then put me on Lamictal starter pack. I have been on 25mg for 12 days and in those 12 days have developed severe manic highs and lows that I have never before felt. I am feeling for the first time what it must be to be truly bipolar, going from one extreme emotion to the other. The most disturbing for me is my new feelings of rage and anger, hostility and violence, all becoming exponentially worse as the days progress, and all feelings I've never had before. I'm also have severe depression episodes. I keep reading how great this medication is for people, and how you have to wait until you hit the right dose to ""feel like a new person"", but I am literally living in hell right now. I've tried to get a hold of every doctor I have but haven't had much help since it is the weekend. My main question is, if my symptoms are so horrible with just the 25 mg, is there any way that they will improve and I will experience that ""new person"" feeling by increasing doses? Or is this is a pretty good indicator that this medication is not right for me? Have any of you felt 10000 times worse before it all of a sudden got better? "

Cough,https://www.drugs.com/answers/cold-bronchitis-3316084.html,How do I know if I have a cold or bronchitis?,"My boyfriend says it is Bronchitis because he's had it before but Bronchitis and pneumonia are also similar with symptoms. I've read that bronchitis can last weeks (the worst of it lasting 2 days to a week). I was out in a cold windy rain on August 29th when my work key got stuck in the door and I couldn't get it out. I fiddled with it for close to a minute before I finally got it out. Got in my car and turned the heat on with semi wet clothes. After work on August 30th I got home and was freezing. I got in my bed and covered up. I took my temperature and it was 103 (the highest it's been through this whole thing). I took some NyQuil to help the fever and to help sleep. August 31st comes around and I wake up feeling bad. Airy head, not wanting to sit up, trouble keeping balance at first. As I got on my work clothes I started feeling a bit better. Once I got to work I realized I probably shouldn't have gone but did anyway. Took DayQuil while I was at work around lunch time. Went home and took my temperature before getting under the covers because I was freezing yet again. Temperature was about 101.5 to 102. Didn't take anything since it was only about 5:30 pm and I didn't want to not be able to take NyQuil to help me sleep. I took NyQuil later that night around 9:00 pm and went to sleep. September 1st I woke up my head felt better, a lot less airy feeling but it still felt like a dull pain whenever I coughed or sneezed which I wasn't doing a ton of. Took my temperature and it was 101. Took some DayQuil with me to work and took it around lunch again. Got home and I wasn't too anal about wanting to cover up. Took my temperature and it was about 100.5. I had ran out of NyQuil so I took another dose of DayQuil with Benadryl to help me sleep. September 2nd is when I started coughing. Not a persistent cough but a cough every now and then from a throat tickle (coughing up clear mucus almost 70% every time I coughed). Again I took my temperature and it was 101. At this point I was sweating. I wanted nothing to do with blankets or anything on my body. I had sweated so bad that night there were wet spots on my bed when I woke up to use the bathroom (I know it's gross). My repeat on DayQuil as it had gone days prior continued but that night I didn't take Benadryl. September 3rd (today). Non. Stop. Coughing. Every cough in the book dry, mucus coming up, rough cough, scratchy cough. It's been awful and I can't seem to get relief. I've coughed up clear as well as small bits of yellow mucus. Temperature has stayed between 99 and 100. Took DayQuil this morning and took another dose recently. Woke up at 5 in the morning and could not go back to sleep because of nonstop coughing. I got so sick of it and I was so tired and I felt bad because I had woke my boyfriend up and was keeping him awak with my coughing that I stuck a Halls drop in my mouth and fell asleep with it in my mouth. Thankfully I seem to have this thing where I can fall asleep with gum or food in my mouth and have never seemed to swallow anything (yet). My breathing is fine not labored and no signs or sound of fluid in my lungs as well as my resting heart rate at 92 beats a minute (46 beats per 30 seconds timed), my appetite is still around as well as I've not been having any issues with wanting to drink. I feel fine. Other than this nasty cough and this fever I feel fine. Im trying to figure out if this sounds more like a cold or bronchitis. I have my boyfriends grandmother in the house with us and she is on oxygen and her lungs are bad so she CANNOT get any kind of lung infection and with Labor Day weekend I can't get to a doctor nor can I get to one during the day and I'm not going to the ER unless I can't breathe and I'm dying. I've avoided her as much as possible. No one in the house has gotten sick yet and my boyfriend would have been the first to catch whatever this is. So I guess this whole detail of my past week sums up to a couple questions. What is this? Should I go to the doctor? What can I do (for now) to help with the fever? Do you think I can recover without doctors intervention? Is there anything I can get from target or Walmart that will help with this nasty cough or something that will make whatever this is better? I could really use some help. Thanks in advance. "

I was told I could start the pill right when I got them or wait til Sunday to start. I decided to go with the first option and at that point I was on the 3rd day of my period (on a Wednesday). Usually my periods last 7 to 9 days max but it's the 10th day and my period shows no signs of stopping. It's usually quite strong the first 3 days and the next 3 are average. However I usually know when it's about to end because it's very weak during the last 2 days but now my flow is as if I was on the 4th day of my period. Did my period restart? I don't understand how there's still so much blood left after a full week of having my period. This period was actually quite heavy as well.

We only had not more than 5 minutes sex (the 1st and 2nd insertion). 1st I did not wet inside her but I wet outside (far from her vagina). So after I wet outside I wiped my penis with tissue (wet with water) and wiped it second time with dry tissue. But I noticed (before I insert my penis in her vagina) there is a precum. So I wiped it with a dry clean blanket. I jerked my penis to see if there are more precum, and then none. After that we had our 2nd time but this time I did not wet inside nor outside so basically I did not wet at all. But my fears for precum are bothering me. Her last period was on March 1-5, 2014. So we decided to buy her an ECP, but it is banned in our country. So I searched on the internet and many people recommend Nordette as an ECP, so I bought it.

But may I mention that before taking the second dose we were quite swimming last night for 1+ hours or so at 6:00 P.M on March 14, 2014.

Doc says to also take metformin.Is this right?","I'm a 45 yr. old female with type 2 diabetic. I've known since 2002 when I went to doctor for harmone treatments that I thought I needed after a complete hystorectomy. Incidentlly found out I was a type 2 diabetic with high blood pressure.  Over the past 8 yrs. I've gone through spells where I didn't always take care of my diabetes. I guess I was in denial partly because of the shady doctor that I thought was in cahoots with the diabetic class instructor due to a snide comment made concerning how much money they made off of the class attendees. Also, when I'd check my sugar, sometimes it would be a little high, like 175, after I'd eaten, but for the most part it was normal. Went a couple or three days without checking it and finally, when I did one morning, it was 555. I freaked! I went to a different internal doctor that confirmed I was a diabetic. After 555, I really needed no confirmation. I was put on metformin and a great diet & excersise plan. I lost 25 lbs. but experienced alot of highs & lows. More highs than lows. I have all the classic symptoms of  Diabetic Ketoacidosis just without the the extreme loss of protien.  Due to a change in employment and insurance I have another doctor who I heard rave reviews about. He's trying to help me get control of my blood sugar. He has prescibed both Metformin AND the Apidra sliding scale insulin pin. I'm really confused because it was never exactly explained to me how I should incorporate the two together. Do I automatically take my metformin as prescibed which is once in the am and then once at pm and then check my sugar before AND after my meal and depending on reading, then administer my insulin? Can't contact doctor at the moment, so I'd really appreciate some input on this. :) Thank you, Confused "

I am sexually active and do not use another form of BC. I have been tested for STDs and was clear. Is it possible I'm shedding my uterine lining without actually having a period? Or could this be pregnancy or miscarriage? HELP! "

Contraception,https://www.drugs.com/answers/mess-micronelle-30-ed-2919787.html,Did I mess up my Micronelle 30 ED?,"Hello all, I started using oral contraceptives for the first time on Tuesday, 22/09/15 (so four days ago) and I'm stressing out a little bit about it. I started my period on the 22/09/15 too, so I started my tablets on the first day of menstrual bleeding. I'm confused and scared and disappointed in myself and I really need your help. I'm using Micronelle 30 ED and it's a 28 day packet. There is the green zone, which are the 21 active pills, and there is the red zone, which are the 7 inactive pills. Like I said, I started my period late Tuesday and I went to get my pills on Tuesday morning. My doctor told me to start on the first Tuesday active pill, and I was like 'okay, that makes sense'. But then I went to pick up my prescription and the pharmacist explained that I have to start on the Tuesday in the red zone because of my period, which is where the inactive tablets are. That made sense in theory too, but I was a bit confused because I had two conflicting instructions from two medical professionals. Also I thought, ""isn't it useless to take a sugar pill on the first day of your period?"" So anyway, I went home, and my period started at 8:00pm, so I decided that I would start taking my pill at 8:30pm every day. I was confused about where to start because I had been told two things, so I decided to read the instructions that came with the pills. Those instructions supported the pharmacist's instructions. This is what the instructions from the pills say: (1) HOW TO START THIS MEDICINE: Start with a tablet from the red zone marked with that day of week. Depending on the day of the week, this may be a yellow (active) tablet or a white placebo (inactive) tablet. (2) WHEN NO HORMONAL CONTRACEPTION HAS BEEN USED IN THE PAST MONTH: Start on the first day of your period (i.e. the first day of menstrual bleeding). Take a tablet from the red zone marked with that day of the week. For example, if your period starts on a Wednesday, then take a tablet marked Wednesday. Then follow the days in order. You must also use an additional barrier method of contraception for the first 14 days of tablet taking. I was really scared about it because I didn't know what to do, but I started taking my pills from the red zone. I took the Tuesday pill from the red zone and I have been following it around every day, on time, no more than 20 seconds late.  So after this long rant comes my question: HAVE I DONE IT WRONG?  I feel really stupid, and I'm pretty sure I've messed it up. My period is very light today and it is about to stop. Tonight I am to take my first active pill from the red zone. (a) What is going to happen?  (b) Am I going to upset my period?  (c) Am I going to upset my body?  (d) Can I continue this way, despite my error? (e) How long will it take before I am protected? (f) Will my period (that is stopping) start again and/or keep going because I am starting an active pill at the end of my bleeding? (e) Is it dangerous to do it the way that I have done it? (f) Should I just stop before I take any active pills and wait for my next period? I need help, ASAP! If only to calm my nerves! And please, I'd appreciate it if nobody lectured me about how I should have clarified it further with the doctor and the pharmacist. That would make me feel worse. I've made a mistake, that is all. Thanks for your help guys! :-) "

I still get my normal period at a regular time with the usual amount of heaviness. Could this spotting be related to sex? Is there any chance I'm pregnant? We almost always use condoms as a second form of protection but there have been a couple of times lately when a condom has not been used. I always take my pill at bedtime every day, and almost never miss a night. If I do miss then I take two pills at the same time the next night. I really just am wondering if this spotting could be related to sex/pregnancy, if it's a side effect of Gianvi, or if there could be something else wrong with me? "

Before getting on this shot, i've had very very normal and regular periods. After my first injection in june, I didn't have any side effects for about 3 weeks. After those three weeks, I started spotting and then bleeding (more than spotting, less than a period) but enough to have to change my panty liner once or twice a day. This continued for the whole rest of the time, from 3 weeks of being on the shot all the way to my second injection. After my second injection(oct. 6), I started to only spot and then no bleeding/spotting at all for about 2 weeks and then I started spotting again which turned into bleeding. The bleeding wasn't bad but it is getting heavier. Ever since I started bleeding from the first injection, I noticed crazy facial acne and now I am noticing weight gain only in my hip area. I am so sick of this! I've told my gyno about this and I nearly cried because I feel major regret getting this shot because I've always had regular periods. My gyno keeps insisting it is normal but I know and feel I'm having crazy hormonal imbalance. I've even went as far as dieting and eating things to try and balance my hormones. I started dieting because of the weight gain in my hips but it doesn't seem to be helping much. I know this weight gain isn't from the common overeating since it is told Depo can increase appetite because I've been cautious this whole time about how much and what I eat and I'm still gaining weight. I need help!!! Ladies, please. I'm getting off this shot, my next Depo is supposed to be December. 14th but I'm not doing it because of all these side effects! I can't afford to gain any more weight and I'm sick of this bleeding. When I get off, what is the best and fastest way to balance my hormones again and get my body back to normal? I thought about switching to pills and that maybe it would straighten out my hormones and get me my periods back but I'm not too sure about that. Please please give me advice on what to do after I get off of this shot. And based on my side effects thus far, does anyone have an idea how my body will react after I stop taking this? And can someone please explain what is going on with me? My gyno is no help!!! P. S. I literally made an account on this website because I just can't handle this anymore and need advice. "

I put a new one in the next day, hoping to slow/stop the bleeding. My period did get a little lighter and just about disappeared the day we were leaving from vacation to come home. The very next day I started bleeding again, it was a dark funky clotted type of bleeding (sorry if that's TMI).  Well this was all almost a month ago and I'm STILL bleeding.

Three days ago I took out the ring and am hoping the bleeding will stop in a few more days, but it's not getting any lighter. It's not quite as clotted anymore though. Have any other long time users ever experienced this? I'm thinking/hoping maybe my hormones just got all out of whack when I put the new ring in so soon.

"Diabetes, Type 2",https://www.drugs.com/answers/over-60-years-adderall-3212412.html,Over 60 years old and on Adderall?,"I recently was diagnosed with pre-diabetes and put on Metformin. However, I was also diagnosed with ADHD over 20 years ago and have been taking stimulant medication since 1994. I feel my life has changed considerably for the best since I was diagnosed with ADHD and put on a stimulant. I was on Ritalin for many years until 2011 when I was placed on Adderall. I also have high cholesterol and am on a statin. I recently began a researching vitamins and have been taking CoQ10, B Multi-vitamin, Omega 3's, Calcium, Magnesium and Zinc (all in one vitamin), Cinnamon and Milk Thistle (very recently) since my liver enzymes are always testing high and I do not get any guidance or further tests done to see what is going on with my liver. Presently, I am 61 years old. Recently, my Family Doctor decided I should take blood pressure medication. It is only recently (the last few visits) I have had what is considered to be a high blood pressure when I am in the Doctor's office. I personally attribute the hbp to ""White Coat Syndrome. My blood pressure was 140 last time I saw my Family Doctor. He wrote me a prescription for an ace-inhibitor- . My blood pressure has always been very good until now. I am wondering if the Adderall could be making my blood pressure higher since I am getting older? Since being diagnosed with ADHD, over 20 years ago, I have been doing so much better in work and my life. I can't imagine my life without a stimulant. I am all over the place and very unorganized normally. My family can tell when I am not on my medication.  I have not taken the blood pressure medication yet. I am trying to see if the vitamins I recently began taking will work for the blood pressure as well as the high cholesterol. I am supposed to go back to my Family Doctor in a few weeks and am hoping when my blood tests come back, my cholesterol, blood pressure and liver enzymes are more in the normal range. My concern is if the Adderall is what is causing my blood pressure to be higher now that I am over 60, with pre-diabetes and the other health issues discussed above.  Should I stop taking Adderall if it is causing my blood pressure to elevate? I am very concerned if I have to stop it because I was a mess 20 years ago without a stimulant. What do you think? Thank you. Donna "

Depression,https://www.drugs.com/answers/depo-shot-emotional-effects-away-3389197.html,When does Depo shot emotional effects go away?,"I got the Depo shot on Feburary 8th, 2017. The first two weeks afterwards I felt fine, surprisingly no side effects so I was happy about getting it. However, when the third week started, all hell started to break lose. Mood swings, severe depression, OCD, severe anxiety, loss of sex drive, constant spotting, loss of attraction to my BF, and more. I know the shot wears off in three months but that doesn't mean that the effects will be gone! Someone please tell me they returned to normal eventually and relatively fast. I wake up everyday in a panic attack, cry all the time for no specific reason, feel ""weird"" and just disconnected from everyone and everything. One thing that happened two weeks ago that is causing me the most distress is how I went from happy with my life and super happy with my relationship, so in love with him, to constantly questioning life, my relationship, if he's the right one, and if I should be in this relationship or not. It's horrible because the thought of not being with him or just not feeling connected and completely happy with him just like in January (or before the shot) gives me tense panic attacks and I break down crying. I must say that I have been diagnosed with OCD and an eating disorder around this time last year but I went to therapy and was put on anti depressants (prozac) and got completely better. I went off the prozac in late November-decemberish 2017 and was completely fine until this stupid shot. What also makes me anxious is the thought of how what if the shot isn't causing this and this is really me just coming to my senses about everything? I had my problems with this relationship in the beginning (worry, slight anxiety, wanting to run away, picking apart things I didn't like about him, etc. but I came to the conclusion that nobody and no relationship is perfect, but all of a sudden two weeks ago everything came bashing back into my head). I feel like I'm going crazy. Will this go away is this caused by the shot or am I just going crazy?! I can't deal with this anymore when will I go back to normal? Everyday I wake up in fear of ruining my life or relationship that was once fun and enjoyable. P.s. He does have his problems, like we all do. I'm a different version of myself around him, but it's still me. At least I think it is. What if I'm not enough or myself around him? I have always thought like this throughout our relationship (been about 4 months now) but before the shot I was able to shut these thoughts down and be in the moment. I saw a future in us and now I am scared of what will just happen today. I need some hope. I'm dying over here. "

I have had very good results. Recently, due to stressful family situations, I have had a relapse in my depression.  My New Psych has decided to lower my cymbalta to 90mg and add 150 XL Wellbutrin. I started this Monday. The first 2 days were fine, however yesterday I woke up feeling very agitated and my sleep seems to be disturbed (which thankfully has never been a real problem for me). I also had a strange feeling I can't quite put my finger on (like I'm restless). I have also woken up this morning feeling agitated, restless (feel like I need to keep moving my feet when in bed or sitting), nauseous and definite sadness.  Now I am a veteran with my condition and know it well. The symptoms I describe have come on since the medication change on Monday. My question is: Could this be the transition while my body gets used to 150mg Wellbutrin? Or is it withdrawal from dropping Cymbalta from 120 mg - 90 mg? I am worried, because I had been doing so well on cymbalta. The depression i felt recently was bad enough, but not nearly as bad as as the Major Depression I had before I started cymbalta. The recent depression (which hit after new years) had pretty clear triggers. Also it was fluctuating. It hit for a week, then I was doing pretty well for 2 weeks. Hit for another week, then did pretty well for 2 weeks. Had another stressful family incident and slumped back into the depression. I discussed all this with my psych last friday and we decided it would be wise to try Wellbutrin 150 (obviously his decision is based on the concern of it developing into full blown Major Depression). However, after seeming my psych on Friday 7th March 2014 I left feeling positive. Now, get this, On the saturday I woke up, (feeling pretty angry/upset, pissed off with old family issues) went surfing and once again started feeling positive and had a reasonably good day and night. Sunday 8th March I once again woke up went surfing, had a good day and was feeling good. I still went ahead with psychs advice on Monday as my depression brings many aches and pains which were still lingering and I thought it may be the solution to prevent another relapse, even though i was feeling good.  I am now questioning myself on whether i should have started the Welbutrin or if I should have waited to see how my mood progressed? I guess i am very fearful of upsetting the balance that Cymbalta has given me! The thought of playing with my meds and upsetting the chemistry in my body really scares me! There are so many horrible stories on withdrawal or adverse effects to starting new meds. I do understand why my psych took this decision, but I'm scared. Any advice would be great Thank you all and solidarity, Sean "

I taped my doses down from 60 to 30, then 30 every second day over the course of 2 months. It has now been 11 days since I last had it and the only way I can describe it is living hell! Some of the horrible effects I've been experiencing have been: Massive brain zaps (feeling like an electric shock charging through your skull), headaches which come and go all too regularly, extreme mood swings (feeling like smashing everything/everyone around you at the slightest annoyance), lots of frustration, loss of coordination and cognitive ability( to the point where it's scary even just trying to cross the road), feeling of utter uselessness and that nothing will change, dizziness, complete inability to feel/express any happiness, feeling completly vacant, memory troubles, getting caught up on all the bad decisions that I've ever made (sounds a bit stupid but all the crap keeps coming back), very vivid dreams (usually consisting of ultra realistic nightmares thus making it feel like I haven't slept), absolutely no motivation or energy, occasional muscle pains, perceiving things that aren't actually there, shortness of breath, irregular heart beat and what seems like mild panic attack just being in public places..The list goes on and I know there are people out there a lot worse off then me and I'm hoping that by posting this it might help other people too. I know this isn't going to last forever but all I want is for some sort of relief until these symptoms subside.

Depression,https://www.drugs.com/answers/stopped-taking-prozac-again-work-3117658.html,"If I stopped taking Prozac and then go on it again, will it still work?","Hello. So, this is probably just my anxiety acting up really badly, but, so I was prescribed 10mg Prozac about a month ago (a little more or a little less) and it worked amazingly for me. Well, my pills ended and I started feeling better, so I decided to stop using the medicine abruptly, which I now realize was a bad/incorrect thing to do, even though the withdrawal symptoms didn't even hit me, or at least went pretty by unnoticeably. Well, about a week or two later, something happened and my anxiety went crazy, which also then caused the depression to come back. I had to wait about a week and a half or so (or less) before I told my therapist and she told me that I should go back on the Prozac, which was a few days ago, where my depression started getting worse (and still is) Like, to the point where I started feeling so bad to where I am like asking myself what the meaning of life is and making my anxiety go crazy that I am having like suicidal thoughts, or whatever. Is that normal, by the way? For depression to get worse quickly if untreated? Anyway, I started taking 10mg Prozac (my first pill) yesterday evening (about 6 PM). (By the way, I should probably mention that the first time I took Prozac I took it in the morning, but I am now taking it in the evenings. Should I go back to taking it in the morning, or it doesn't matter?) I know this is still REALLY early to start doubting the medication and everything, especially if it worked for me the first time, but I'm scared that it may not work for me again. Especially since the first time I stopped taking it so abruptly. I'm just so desperate to feel better again and scared that the depression will get even worse. I know it takes 4-12 weeks to start working to its full effect, but I am just terrified that the Prozac won't help me again, and then I'd end up taking a low dosage, still feeling like crap, just to see that I needed to up the dosage or switch medicines or something. Anyway, yes, I'm sorry for such a long thing, but my anxiety is just really going crazy over this, like I'm just tired and terrified of feeling depressed like this. I've literally read so many articles online and it's just making me feel worse, seeing people coming off of Prozac and then going back on and not feeling better. If anyone needs anymore information, I am very capable of giving it. Thanks so much "

If so, what can help?","I was diagnosed with COPD 5 years ago. I was prescribed large doses to prednisone to get it under control, as well as Spiriva and Qvar 2/day. At that time I was taking 50mg 3/day. It was my first experience with prednisone and the only time I have taken it. I thought I was going to die. Since then I have maintained pretty well with my exercise and medication, have never had to use my rescue inhaler. I did lose my good job because of the COPD. In the past three months I have had an infected bursa in my elbow which required large doses of Doxycycline which made me an insomniac, a nervous wreck and to lose my appetite. Just about the time that was getting well, I developed a really sore throat. Was told I had a sinus infection although no sinus pressure or pain, or colored discharge. Was prescribed amoxicillin 2000mg/day. That run was completed, felt better for four days and the sore throat came back even worse. Was given a 2m injection of Rocephin. That messed my digestive tract up real well. I started having bad anxiety almost constantly since the Doxycycline. The sore throat and massive post-nasal drip continued. Went to see ENT Dr. yesterday. Prescribed more prednisone. As I said I am a nervous wreck, I have lost 15 pounds, I feel totally weak all the time, and am still not sleeping well. Had a bad panic attack this morning, as I am getting chest congestion now. I hate to be a whiner because I know a LOT of people are worse off than me. Until the COPD I was rarely ill. "

Constipation,https://www.drugs.com/answers/does-any-one-else-have-bowl-problems-constipation-479986.html,Does any one else have bowl problems & constipation after taking Codeine?,"My doctor gave me a prescription for codeine after I fell off a ladder at work & fractured some bones in my foot & ankle. They helped to manage the pain however after the first few days I started to become constipated & gasy. It got worse; after about a week I couldn't go at all. So I called my doctor who told me to drink lots of water, and also to take laxitives &/or stool softeners. I just stopped taking the codeine & got some alieve instead. I was in alot more pain but it was worth it to me. My waist was very bloated, hard, & painful, It literally took me more than a week to get "" It "" out & be regular again. Apparently this is common with pain medication. I just want to give everyone a heads-up about this side effect. I even came across a story where some one dealt with the constipation pains by taking more codeine, & became so impacted that they ruptured their intestines & didn't even know about it cause they were so dopped up. Finally in a few short days they became so sick they called the life squad to take them to the E.R.. They had to be cut open, their insides 'vacuumed' out & sewn back together, they had to stay at the hospital on antibiotics cause their insides were exposed to fecal matter, + the surgery. They had to be on an I.V. for nutrients, etc.. ; drink some kind of special drinks (no solid food) And also after the surgery they had to repeatedly put a hoses inside them to spray a solution up there to break up the 'stuff' so that they could suck ""it"" out with a hose. It took 2-3 days but the docs & nurses were finally satisfied. It was something like twenty-something pounds of fecal matter they removed. I know this was a long sick story but I heard it from people who were there, I probably missed a few details but this kind of stuff happens more than most people realize so be careful & especially watch out for the young ones & even more the elderly in your family because they may already be on so many medications, & it can be tough just getting them selves onto the toilet. OK, I got super lucky, I got on top of the problem quickly and resolved the issue without a serious problem. good luck, take care of your family when they need you, they would do it for you & the older ones probably already did more than you know to help out back in the day.

Help me find a painless remedy!!?","I’ve been chronically constipsted for a couple of years now. I will go 1-2 weeks without passing stool. It’s not that I can’t go, but that it’s EXTREMELY painful, to the point of being mildly traumatic, and I avoid going, expecting that I will be able to find a way of passing it with less pain. Inevitably it gets to the point where it has to come out and I will pass it with a great deal of pain and discomfort. I always feel SO much better once it’s gone, but for some reason I avoid that moment of passing a giant baseball sized stool, hoping that I’ll be able to soften it somehow. I’ve gotten to the point of even waiting until I can get some sort of benzodiazepine so that I can avoid as much of the traumatizing experience as possible. I even have mild PTSD regarding my bowel movements. Clearly I have an issue... my doctor said she will prescribe me medication to help, but first I need to get everything out so that the medication can work. My question is this: What can I do to make passing this stool as painless as possible? I have not yet tried enemas, or suppositories. Ive heard people say that a hot compress in the space below your anus can help.. I’m afraid that any stool softener or laxative will only affect the stool further up in my colon, and not the stool that is ready to come out. I can hardly even urinate i am so constipated.. every time I do, the urge to go poop is extremely present, and I can feel how large and hard the stool that needs to come out is. Will a suppository Actually soften the stool enough so that it can come out less painfully? Will an enema be able to do this before it forces me to push out the giant mass?

Wellbutrin and Celexa?,"Recently I have moved from 40mg of citalopram (Celexa) daily, taken at bedtime for approx. 8 years,  to 20mg of citalopram + 150mg bupropion (Wellbutrin), told by pharmacist to take the citalopram in the morning and the Wellbutrin at night with my birth control pill. Over three months I saw a negative impact on my anxiety and depression levels, but it helped prevent me from sleeping for 12-14 hours a night as I was before. NOW I have moved to 20mg citalopram + 300mg Wellbutrin and I mentioned to the pharmacist that, like many people on the internet report, the Wellbutrin is having a stimulating effect and while that worked to prevent me from sleeping too much, the higher dose was preventing a full sleep. She said ""okay, this can happen, or the opposite can happen, but this is how it affects you so take it in the morning."" so I asked ""should I then be taking it at the same time as the citalopram? or would it be better to switch them and go back to taking the citalopram at night?"" I was pretty unhappy when the final answer was that I should be taking the citalopram in the morning, then letting it get into my system before taking the Wellbutrin at noon, then continue taking the birth control as usual. I will say I am not good at remembering to take my pills and medications! Despite alarms and reminders and placing them in convenient places, I continue to SUCK at it. Now I have to remember THREE times a day? I can tell already that it'll work for about a month and as soon as it becomes routine it will get all screwed up.  She really couldn't tell me WHY I should take the citalopram in the morning only. Officially the instructions for the medication say ""take morning or evening with or without food, same time daily"" and I already know it doesn't keep me awake, as I've been oversleeping after taking it for 8 years, and I've gone off and back on and off again and back on so many times that I know the citalopram is not the cause of the hypersomnia. Anyone have any advice? Also I should say that I wake up at crazy times, sometimes 7 and sometimes noon.. that makes it hard to keep a morning pill schedule.

Starting at the end of May I started having problems with depression & anxiety. I'm still not 100% sure what brought it on, but probably to do with selling our condo due to it being a very stressful environment (noisy neighbours, noise from the street & parking garage, useless building management, etc), and also I had a pretty bad iron deficiency. To help me cope with the depression & anxiety, I was put on 10mg of Cipralex (Lexapro's name in Canada) in early-to-mid June. The doctor then upped it to 20mg after a week or two (he said that was the maintenance dose. It isn't.. 10mg is. I think he was confusing it with Celexia..). I started seeing a psychiatrist and she had me reduce back down to 10mg in August I think, which I did with only a day or two of withdrawal symptoms a couple of weeks later. I was feeling fine for a while and since my problems were likely situational, and my husband and I want to start trying to conceive in early 2011, I decided to go off the Cipralex, starting in November. I was on 10mg/day, and at the advice of my psychiatrist, tapered off as follows (this is the same way I went from 20mg down to 10mg): Week 1: 10mg Mon/Wed/Fri, 5mg the rest of the days Week 2: 10mg Mon/Thurs, 5mg the rest Week 3: 10mg Mon, 5 mg the rest I followed this pattern to get from 10mg to 5mg, then again from 5mg to 2.5mg (I bought a pill cutter). Then I started it for 2.5mg to 0mg, but was finding that the starting and stopping was causing problems; I'd be okay one day, and feel terrible the next. So I did the first two weeks of the pattern, but decided not to take the final 2.5mg dose. So my last dose of 2.5mg was about a week and a half ago (Thurs Dec 23). I've been feeling pretty bad off and on through the past week and a half.. some days better than others, but today's been another bad one (I should point out that today is the first day back at work since Christmas) My main symptoms are: -General ""not good"" feeling, usually in the evenings, but sometimes in the day -Feeling like I'm drunk or in a memory.. hard to describe, but just that I'm not quite in my normal reality -Sudden short dizzyness, off and on throughout the day. Seems to be worse with sudden head movements, as well as going up & down stairs. This seems to have stopped in the past few days. Not sure if it's gone for good or not. -Increased heart rate. It's still in the ""normal range"", but my pulse normally sits around 60 when I'm walking around, and I've counted it at 80bmp when I'm lying in bed, so it's high for me -Diarrhea most mornings, and sometimes at other times, as well as some nausea sometimes -Occasional depression/hopelessness -Some anxiety with a couple of small almost-panic attacks (I'm getting good at not letting those happen, but I can feel that they've tried to come on) I also went off my birth control after October, but I think everything's fine with that as I've had two normal cycles. So my question is, how long can I expect this to last? I'm pretty sure it's just the withdrawal, but when I'm feeling bad, I'm not convinced (the nature of the beast I guess). I know it's different for everyone, but I just feel like if I could have an idea of when this is going to end, I might have an easier time getting through it.. Let me know if you need any other info to be able to give me a more accurate idea.. but I think I've put it all in this long rambling post! "

I'm having the feeling I'm not really getting any better on the meds - it feels like the opposite. When I started I was totally stressed out but didn't really feel depressed nor with a very low self esteem. Every day that passes I get like more scared, unsecure and desperate. My personal life is very unsecure since way back. Lost all my money in a business I opened. And I don´t feel like if I can look for a job right now, with these depression and low self esteem issues. I got offered a job but had to say NO. I need to feel okey first!! Any thoughts, ideas, some reinsurance. "
Depression,https://www.drugs.com/answers/lose-weight-gained-depakote-2245890.html,Lose weight gained on Depakote?,"Starting from the beginning, I went to college in August 2012 and lost 30 pounds just from walking around campus through the semester even though I was eating my way through a depression. I was in the best shape of my life. Then, I was diagnosed with type 2 bipolar in December and had a severe allergic reaction to Lamictal through February requiring 2 steroid packs to clear the rash. Then, I was put on Depakote for 9 months starting in March of 2013. I gained 25 pounds in the first two weeks of taking it. A couple months after I started Depakote I started taking Topamax to help with the weight gain and it didn't really do anything. After stopping Depakote I switched to Lithium in December of 2013. Then I stopped Lithium in August 2014 and I'm only of Topamax and some other anxiety meds and an antidepressant. All this time later all of my meds are specifically chosen to not cause weight gain and even though my diet is the same as two years ago and my exercise routine is more extreme with heavy cardio I STILL can't lose this weight. It makes me sick that these drugs could have screwed my life this much. I just want to know that losing this weight is possible. "

Except for antibiotic once in a blue moon. Doctor prescribe Citalopram (Celexa) 20mg for anxiety and depression and it was a horrible 30 hours experience. After just an hour and a half after taking the pill I felt fuzzy in the mind and had like slow thoughts and very clumsy. I took it at around 7pm. My eyes were dialated for about 14 hours. I went to sleep and woke up every 30min and never really did fall into a deep sleep. Also had nausea before going to sleep. The whole next day I did not want to get up out of bed. I felt floopy and clumsy and got up a few times and do a few things around the house that I have to do but then feel like laying down. Tv was on but I could care less. 4 hours go by and it felt like 10min. Just looking at tv and not caring about it. Went on fb and found myself reading every single word and not realizing it until minutes later and think to myself, ""why am I reading this?"" and not even comprehending what I was reading. Then when I wanted to comprehend something written I had to really make myself pay attention. I did not feel like myself at all. I spent more time just sitting and thinking about doing something and then not doing it. I finally start feeling like myself at 4am the next day. I don't want to make another doctor appointment for insurance reasons. Will it be a good idea to crush up the pill and take 1/4 of it and see how it is? "
Depression,https://www.drugs.com/answers/clonazepam-make-you-angry-irritable-inhibit-850261.html,Can clonazepam make you angry/irritable and inhibit the ability to absorb new information?,"Hey team! Just to start off with a little background, I have had previous episodes of depression, where I wouldn't get out of bed and sit in my room and wallow and become sad. Recently my anxiety got so bad that my frontal lobe was constantly throbbing to the point of extreme pain that I could only hold my head. I wouldn't be able to run outside, or even leave my room, with the irrational belief that someone is watching me. I am also on antidepressants, but I can confidently say I am not depressed (my major is Psychology) At this stage my frontal lobe is hurting quite a bit, this is the area of the brain that is associated with executive functioning and planning. I go from periods of anger about my current situation (living back at home aged 25, no girlfriend, ON MEDICATION, and haven't felt comfortable around being with friends). Personally I think I have been making the excuse of seeing my friends as an anxiety issues. This was true, as at one stage I had a panic attack before going to a friend's event. But today after returning to university I feel that my memory, recollection of events, even simple things like what I did in the day (when my parents would ask me what I did) I would have trouble recalling it, then I would worry about my memory fading then I would start crying. I also find that listening and concentrating to what people say has been proving difficult. I have always had an issue with this, ever since a little child, I've had tutors to help me out with subjects. I am extremely angry at the moment after coming out of a lecture, that my encounter with a new friend I just met (which seemed genuine) didn't make me feel positive at all after. On top of that, after writing a bajillion notes of all the lecture material I feel I haven't learnt anything - LIKE NOTHING IS GOING IN. I've also known to be a positive, outgoing person, who is easy to get along with and hang around. But I feel this medication is making me do the opposite. I fear I have a learning/attention/concentration disability which is also affecting my memory. I am very away of the self fulfilling prophecy, and that your thoughts are what you are. This might be true as I do tend to think a lot at times, so much so that I almost nearly gave up on life, because I thought of myself of just a lazy, stupid sod who isn't doing anything. Another side effect of the drug I've noticed Is a slight loss in balance, the stumbles and mild postural hypotension (that dizzy feeling you get when you abruptly stand up). What are your guys thought? I'm seeing the psychiatrist at the end of the week and I will copy this transcript for him to read. I've always been against medication however I am aware that it is needed in certain situations to alleviate symptoms of anxiety/depression or any other disorder. But this is just still constantly making my head hurt, my speech is becoming slurred at time, my voice breaks when I talk sometimes. So maybe my anxiety is manifestation in a different form, the form that I feel I am not confident or intelligent enough to speak aloud. This mere post is a representation of my anxiety of not being able to properly express and order my thoughts face to face like a normal human being.  Sorry to ramble on and moan but I was just interested in seeing what your thoughts are on these side effects.  Cheers, Daniel Le Fevre "

So - I have been on Suboxone for 3 months now. I basically was taking anything I could get my hands on... started with Vicoden... Perc's..then Oxy's..Roxy's..etc... was on them for about a year. I started with tramadol..(HORRIBLE DRUG) -because it made me feel like supergirl... i could clean... work... be super mom... i felt SO motivated..but stopped after I ran out... (a ""friend"" gave them to me for free)- and moved on to the ""big guns"" from this same friend. HOWEVER, i had to pay for these meds... i was taking 8-10 Vicoden a day... then moved on to Roxy's... (about 3-4 30's a day) - costing me $30 a day... i hid this... all of it... from everyone... my husband, job, friends, family..EVERYONE. I finally came clean to my husband..sobbed my eyes out... was going thru withdrawal horribly... i could have won a stupid academy award for hiding this habit for an entire year... he was in shock but it made sense finally to him why i was always so speedy. I blamed it on Red Bulls when talking to friends or family... (that is what i always felt... SPEED... the ability to do anything..it felt great..) - however, i also felt like the most horrible mother on the planet because I am a mother of two beautiful twin 4 year olds and know that they don't know what i was doing but i KNEW i could not carry on this habit forever. Is started to notice how my skin was changing... my weight going down... (too down... ) I KNEW i had to quit. I came clean when withdrawling to my husband. It was so obvious that i was sick, but i couldn't lie anymore. He is a nurse... and never thought in a million years that I would EVER do anything like that. However, he didn't put me on a guilt trip. Instead he got me help. He read online about treatment facilities, etc... but i refused to go... i HAVE to keep this a secret..being in the profession i am in. My husband reached a Dr. right away that could see me right away..(he researched Suboxone online) - I went in... he did all these little tests like look in my eyes from behind me..have me do a test where I held my arms out in front of me... of course filled out the questionnaire and I checked YES on every single question..Yes... i have a runny nose... body aches... chills..anxiety... diarrhea... overall felt like dying... he prescribed me enough for one week... had to come back..if my urine was clean i would come back monthy. of course it came back clean..and i have been going monthly ever since. However, I take a half tablet in the am and a half at 5 pm. the bottle says 8 - 2 mg. what does that mean?? well... as SOON as i took my first tablet..(i took a whole one that afternoon because he told me to) - about a half hour to an hour later i was back to normal. It, to me, was the wonder drug. it saved my life. I have been taking the same amount for 3 months now but today i experienced something odd. I took my regular AM dose and my heart started to race... i started to sweat... it scared me. My husband took my vitals..i was ok... but i took .50 clonezpam, (been on it since my kids were born..(almost 4 yrs... I gave birth to triplets and when one of my sons passed due to prematurity i needed something to calm me down)... my therapist seems to think i started this habit as an escape being as i do not have a history of addiction. however, i know i started this habit because it gave me the ability to keep up with life. i was always so tired... and all these drugs did was give me the ""boost"" i needed. My questions are: How long will i really be on this stuff?? Should I taper down on my own?? Is constipation a huge issue for any of you?? it is for me... all of the time.

Constipation,https://www.drugs.com/answers/3-weeks-constipation-3254700.html,3 weeks of constipation?,"I am hoping I could get some reassurance that what I am going through is normal, even though I feel like I may be dying.  I have never had regular BMs. My normal was once maybe twice a week. It never caused me problems except the occasional (non-painful) gas bloat. This all changed about 2 weeks ago when I started having mild abdominal pain. I brushed this off as being PMS and dealt with the pain. Not only did the cramps continue to get worse, but I found out I was pregnant. Assuming what I was constipated I began treating it. Increased fiber, drank a ton of water, watched my diet, and started takin stool softners. Nothing helped. Next route was Miralax. Took that for two days with no relief. Finally I tried milk of magnesia. I was able to get relief, but that only lasted for a day. The next day my pains were back again. It was a crippling pain that brought me to tears. I didn't know what else to do! Finally I decided to try and enema. I did one in the morning and no relief by that evening and the cramps were now at it's worse. Given my pregnancy and my history of epilepsy I know things were getting worse so I went to the ER. They determined I was impacted and suggest I take Magnesium Citrate. I drank a bottle that night and nothing happened. The next day, still nothing. I haven't been able to eat anything solid in almost a week so I know there isn't much of anything left for me to pass, but the minute I try to eat anything it goes right through me causing horrible pain. I have been seen by the doctors and they said this is just a normal side effect of pregnancy, but can't explain the horrible pain. I guess what I am trying to ask is if anyone else had similar side effects following laxative use? Do I just need to give my system time to calm down from all of the medicine I put in it, or do I have a more serious problem on my hands? As long as I don't eat or drink anything my stomach is fine.

Blood Disorders,https://www.drugs.com/answers/when-should-i-take-blood-pressure-medication-461030.html,At what point  should I take blood pressure medication?,"I would like to post this question again. My doctor at Scripps has been trying to get me to take blood pressure medications for a year now. At one point his nurse actually told me that they didn't want to see me again if I didn't take medication. My blood pressure when they take it at Scripps is around 130/90. When I went in for eye lid surgery a few months ago at a different medical group my blood pressure during surgery was reported as114/76. When I check it at drug stores and other places it is never over 120/80. When I check it at home it is usually below 120/80. I use an OMRON HEM-775 machine at home and just checked it: 118/79 Could it be that the nurses and doctors at Scripps do not know how to take blood pressure or they are trying to get everone over 55 to take blood pressure medications? And I wonder if Scripps is trying to get as many patients on blood pressure medications as possible to create a large control group that can be studied in the future? I certainly don't want a stroke or heart attack, but on the other hand I don't want to be on medications that I don't need. At what point should I take blood pressure medications?

Depression,https://www.drugs.com/answers/taper-abilify-3434430.html,How can one reasonably taper off Abilify?,"Let me preface this by saying, I was never schizophrenic in my life, and I was put on the medication as an adjunct to resistant depression in 2004.  The important facts are as follows: I've been taking 5 mg of Abilify since July 17th , was at 7.5 mg for prior two months (May 24 - July 17), and 10 mgs (March 1 - May 24). I had been hospitalized in December 2017 with mania mixed with delusional thoughts. At time of discharge, the psych docs raised me to 20 mgs and I remained at that high through February 1st. For those who have tapered off Abilify is going down a level every month safe and what side effects can be expected as I drop my dosage by 50% this month and then from 2.5 mg to nothing next month.  I feel the drug has caused daytime fatigued and a fair amount of sleep apnea upon each dose change. To alleviate any mood swings, Lamictal was introduced in mid March. It was gradually increased to 100 mgs by June. I do feel much more ""stable"" and there has not been any recurrence of original symptoms. So I'm very glad for that. I just hope that dropping by 50% this time from the prior 33% drop doesn't bring back the feelings of persecution and suspiciousness brought about by last year's abrupt withdrawal from 10 mg to 2 mgs in 2 month's time. I've read where Breggin and Cohen recommend a 10% withdrawal rate, extended in time for each year of use. Is that sage advice?  ANY advice? My nurse psych practitioner told me S.O.P. is to reduce Abilify from 5 mg to straight discontinuation - which seems a bit hasty for one and secondly have other people heard of this protocol. IF my move to 2.5 mg zonks me out or makes me lightheaded, would other people suggest alternating with 5 mg tablets? Need insight from sensitive Abilify users. Greatly appreciate others' first hand stories as to how it was for them to come off the med. "

I have a whole lot of stuff going on in my life beyond the clinical depression. So I don't know if maybe I didn't have so much stress going on that maybe the 150mg. would be enough to get better. Basically I am trying to find out if anyone has gotten better from major depression only taking 150 mg. (SR). I am 37 yrs. old, this is my 6th episode of major depression, in the past I have taken an older medicine (a trycilic called Nortriptyline) I have always gotten better, I mean totally recovered but it took awhile. I started a new job and did not have a lot of time to wait for meds to work. So I decided to try another class of medicines that might work faster. So here I am 7 weeks later on 150mg. and still a wreck. I really don't want to step up to 300 mg. as I don't get the best rest now, so I am concerned about that. However if 150mg. is just not enough in general to beat major depression than I am just wasting time. I am still wondering if I didn't have so much stress happening in my life due to other circumstances, would the 150mg. have been enough, like maybe all my upset doesn't allow the 150mg. to work? I dunno... I just need to get better, as I cannot go on feeling like this much longer. Anyone??? Thanks in advance! "

I am on 60 mg of Cymbalta, have been for years and I do believe it helps my depression more than using Wellbutrin alone. I have noticed a very strange reaction if I miss a dose of Cymbalta and would love to know if anyone else has experienced this. When I miss a dose of Cymbalta I have the absolutely most technicolor wild-ass dreams I can imagine. They are the kind of dreams that are near impossible to wake yourself out of, because they seem so very real. I have even experienced this if I take a morning nap and have not taken the Cymbalta. All I can surmise is that the Cymbalta really acts on my brain chemicals in a strong manner. These dreams are never pleasant and they stand out in my mind for days. I don't want to sound like a whiner or a weirdo, but I would really like to know if anyone has had the same experience. I have always tended toward strange dreams (night terrors as a child) so maybe this is a normal variant for me. But sure would love to hear from someone who has the same experiences. Thanks so much!

Depression,https://www.drugs.com/answers/cymbalta-adderall-ir-xr-interaction-528405.html,Cymbalta and Adderall (IR and XR) interaction?,"This is my first time posting on one of these message boards but because I just can’t seem to find any answers anywhere, I decided to post! I also, I am interested in seeing if there is anybody else out there that is experiencing the same problem!  I was diagnosed with ADHD about 5 years ago and I have tried multiple medications (to name a few: Vyvanse, Focalin, Metadate, Concerta, Wellbutrin, and Strattera) all of which have either been ineffective or the side-effects were so bad I had to stop taking them. Adderall is the only medication that seems to work well for me and my ADHD. I’ve been taking Adderall XR and IR off and on over the past three years (consistently since I started graduate school fall 2011). Last fall I was taking 25mg of Adderall XR and 10mg of the IR every morning with an occasional extra 10-20mg of IR throughout the day. Both Adderall XR and IR worked perfectly fine for me and I had absolutely no problems. Also note that I have been diagnosed with OCD (I think I got the official diagnosis 6 or 7 years ago). I’ve been on numerous SSRIs Zoloft, Prozac, Paxil, etc., and switched for various different reasons.  My psychiatrist’s told me that I could I eventually wean off the SSRI and I would be able to manage my OCD quite well using techniques learned in therapy. This has been the case for the last two years, until December 2011, when my OCD became unmanageable. I decided to go to my psychiatrist and get back on some medication that would help with the OCD and the accompanying depression/anxiety. She prescribed Cymbalta (starting initially with 30mg and ramping up to 60mg) and I stated taking it January 23rd 2012.  Initially, I had terrible nausea from Cymbalta, but after about a week the nausea went away and I thought my Cymbalta troubles were over! Skip ahead a couple of weeks, every morning, I was taking Adderall 25mg XR, 10mg IR, and 60mg Cymbalta and I began to notice changes in my focus. My Adderall seemed to almost completely lose its effectiveness (increasing the IR throughout the day didn’t seem to make a difference) and (in the morning especially) I was bouncing off the walls (feeling like I couldn’t contain myself in class, feelings of wanting to get out and do active things, etc.). I know Cymbalta is supposed to increase energy (or something to that extent) but I didn’t even think it would effect Adderall. As soon as I realized it might be the Cymbalta causing the Adderall to be ineffective I put a call into my psychiatrist and then called my pharmacist. They both basically said the same thing: for some people, when Cymbalta and Adderall are taking at the same time the Cymbalta for whatever reason (can’t remember) negates the Adderall and can make the patient feel overly jittery and unable to focus. They both suggested trying to split up the Adderall and the Cymbalta. Now I take the Adderall first thing in the morning and the Cymbalta around 2:30pm every afternoon. My psychiatrist also bumped me up to 35mg Adderall XR and told me to increase the morning IR to 20-30mg IR (amount taken as needed in the afternoon).  So it has been about a month…I HAVE seen some positive changes effects in splitting the two medications up, I am no longer climbing the walls, but my Adderall just isn’t as effect as it used to be pre Cymbalta. Throughout a whole day I may take about 50mg IR. That is crazy to me considering pre Cymbalta I probably maxed out at about 30mg on an extreme day. When I take Adderall IR anytime after taking Cymbalta it doesn’t seem to be effective AT ALL! I am so frustrated.  So here is my question (if you’re still reading): has anybody experienced Cymbalta negating Adderall XR and IR? If so please explain to what extend! Also please pass along any suggestion on how to get the most out of my Adderall and any information about the interaction of Cymbalta and Adderall! There is hardly any information about this particular type of interaction so any information would be much appreciated!  Below are the basic diagnostic, dosage, and medication facts: Diagnosed: -ADHD -OCD Pre-Cymbalta medication and dosage: -25mg Adderall XR in the morning -10mg Adderall IR in the morning -an additional total of10-20mg Adderall IR throughout the day as needed Current Cymbalta dosage: -60mg taken about 2:30pm Current Adderall dosage: -35mg Adderall XR in the morning -20mg Adderall IR in the morning -an additional total of 10-30mg taken throughout the day as needed Thanks for your time and comments!

Either no effect or only side effects and of course the withdrawal after stopping the medications. I became very turned off and scared of antidepressants because of the side effects and withdrawal. I have shared that with my recent psychiatrist and he suggested trying Vyvanse at 20mg in the morning as my biggest complaint was constant fatigue, concentrate, engage in hobbies, socialize, etc. I have panic attacks the worse I'm feeling during a period of time so I was also given Ativan. For the first time, I was able to do things, socialize, eat better, exercise, etc. and my 30 tabs of Ativan lasted me over 4 months because I didn't get attacks often anymore. I was still struggling with suicidal thoughts and other mental blocks however, so I went off of Vyvanse to try Pristiq which made everything worse and ruined my ability to sleep normally... I struggled with insomnia all my life and I'm in the process of getting back to where I was. This is my second day sleeping without sleeping pills! Very hard...  I'm now back on Vyvanse and he knows I still have my bad thoughts and insisted on giving Zoloft 25mg a try; I resisted but I found after 1-2 weeks, I actually had a week or so of no suicidal thoughts, overthinking, paranoia... etc. I didn't even notice I felt better in that regard, but I felt the most fatigue I've ever felt on Zoloft even while on Vyvanse... A week after, my thoughts came back and I'm slightly less tired and I think it is because I now require a higher dose of Zoloft or perhaps I should try something else? I have heard Prozac is similar to Zoloft but minus the fatigue so I'm curious about that... Any advice? "

Blood Disorders,https://www.drugs.com/answers/isoniazid-please-get-the-blood-test-if-you-skin-462861.html,Isoniazid - Please get the blood test if you skin test is positive!?,"20 years ago, after my first year working in a hospital (medical records) my TB skin test turned positive. After waiting 2 weeks, they did another skin test which was also positive. I was put on INH therapy for 6 months. After 3 months, I started having nerve problems in my hands and feet. Stabbing needle pains. They did nerve conduction studies that showed I developed Stage II nerve damage (stage III is irreversible, stage II ""can"" reverse itself) I was taken off INH after 4 months. I still have nerve problems in my hands and feet plus restless leg syndrome and a wandering neuropathy. Now 20 years later, I started a new job at a new hospital. After telling the health screen nurse all this, she said there is a blood test that can determine if you ""really"" have been exposed or if you are just allergic to a component of the skin test or if the skin test was actually read properly. After listening to her explain how the skin test should read on an actual positive, I knew my test 20 years ago was not read properly. A ""real"" positive should have an M&M size nodule underneath the skin that is very very hard. The nodule does not go away for a few weeks. The nodule and any redness around the area should be measured accurately for that is a determining factor also. This health screen nurse offered to do a blood test and I'm sorry I forget the name of the test but it has ""gold"" in the name. Sure enough, it turns out I was never exposed to TB AT ALL. I didn't have to take INH. I didn't have to go through 20 years of restless leg syndrome, needle pains in my feet or hands, or wandering neuropathy! I didn't have to worry and fret if I was going to develop TB and expose my family to it. I will have restless leg syndrome the rest of my life (I'm 48) Its painful!  Please, if you have had a positive skin test, find a hospital that will do this blood test. It is a very expensive test (approx $375) but completely worth it. If you don't have to take INH, don't!! Its a damaging drug. It has impacted my life for the rest of my life... all for nothing. Please take the blood test to make absolutley sure you were exposed to TB. "

I've been diagnosed with GAD which also results in depression. I've felt this way for about 4 months - triggered by very stressful life events. Because I have periods during the day when I feel ""normal"" and because of my reactions to the Zoloft and Nortriptyline, my pdoc thinks I have a mood disorder - perhaps bipolar 2. I've also had this happen two other times in the past 8 years - also preceded by significant life stressors. The first time it was just depression (although the diagnosis was anxiety) and it passed after a few months without medication. The second time it was mostly anxiety and I took Paxil. I had to wait 8 weeks for the Paxil to kick in but eventually it did and I got better. I was on the Paxil for 10 months. I should note that I've never had a true manic episode. My ""ups"" are just a feeling of centeredness and contentment - just feel good and normal. My main symptoms are depression and anxiety. Will the Lamotrigine work for me? If so, when should I expect to at least get some signs? It's been 5 days on 25 mg. No bad side effects. Does seem to have helped a little with the anxiety but not the depression yet.

I have Bipolar Disorder I, Fybromyalgia, Agoraphobia, ADHD, Hypothyroidism. I started the new meds (Klonopin and Adderall) on Thursday, September 13, 2012. It has all gone down hill from there. I am majorly depressed, I feel lonely, hopeless, empty and scared. I was not having those feelings before the added meds. I am use to the chronic pain, the high anxiety, the major migraines, the brain fogs but the depression has not been this bad in over a year. It has to have something to do with the Klonopin. Has anyone ever heard of Klonopin causing this? My doctor chose to put me on this medicine because I am still constantly anxious and he wanted something in my system that had a lasting affect. I take the Xanax when I am in a really bad anxious situation, like outside in crowds, in stores or at ball games for my children and other situations. I also take Xanax every night to help with racing thoughts so I can sleep. I just don't understand why it has thrown me into such a deep depression. I can't hardly function. I am crying constantly and I don't want to answer my phone or go out for anything although I have two very active children I must do these things for. I have put in a phone call to my doctor but I don't know when he will call me back. Should I stop taking the Klonopin? Have I been taking it long enough to cause a bad reaction to stop taking it cold turkey? Also, the Latuda is supposed to help me as a mood stabilizer but I don't feel like it is. That is why I am worried I am over medicated and maybe some of the meds are keeping other meds from working correctly. Please, any advise or a suggestion would be greatly appreciated. "

Depression,https://www.drugs.com/answers/adhd-medicine-2906242.html,Which ADHD medicine to try next?,"So it's been about 6 weeks since I started on my first ADHD/ADD medicine. (I'm a 28 year old female). I have anxiety issues and have dealt with depression in the past. I decided to go to a psych to get my ADHD diagnosed because I just can't ever get anything done & have the worst procrastination tendencies. So here is my question: which ADHD medicine should I try next? I'll list the 2 I've already tried and my side effects...  Generic Concerta (aka Methylphenidate ER) Tried 36mg, 54mg, 72mg doses over a span of 3 weeks While it made me feel more clear-headed and focused, I also had increased anxiety on the 54 and 72 (the 36mg didn't really do anything for me). It also made me feel cry-ee when I took it every day... and put me in a bad, un-social mood. My Dr. told me that the generic form can have worse side effects and not work as well as the brand, so she is still keeping Concerta BRAND (DAW) as an option. Generic Adderall XR (by Teva) Tried 10mg, 20mg, 30mg over a 3 week span I felt nothing much on the 10mg. The 20mg made me lethargic, apathetic, and un-sociable... I felt really lazy and didn't want to do anything. The 30mg was pretty much the same except it made me go into hyper-focus mode on stupid things like word puzzles... Also felt pretty depressed at the end of the day on the 20 and 30. I really didn't like this medication... I didn't feel like myself and it did not increase my focus at all or clear my constant brain fog. Also at the end of the day I felt like I needed to take really deep breaths, had heartburn, and my body kinda felt buzzy... like it was vibrating under my skin... well I guess I kind of felt like that all day but noticed it more at night. On a positive note, this med didn't increase my anxiety it actually made it go away. Still, I don't like it. So I'm getting really frustrated... I go to see my Dr. in a few days and I don't know whether I should request to try Vyvanse or Concerta BRAND... I need some suggestions! / help! Has anyone had this same problem with these meds? "
Depression,https://www.drugs.com/answers/bupropion-150mg-day-sr-generic-welbutrin-work-3065139.html,Bupropion 150mg once a day Sr generic for Welbutrin. Does this work? How long does it take to feel?,My doctor just gave me this today for anxiety and depression. I'm constantly worrying about everything and have racing thoughts through out the day. I have no motivation and no energy from the time I get up to the time I go to bed. I just feel sluggish and tired all day long that it's really hard to get anything accomplished and get through the day. I just always feel so miserable and never wanna talk to anyone. The doctor told me this is gonna take 3-4 weeks to kick in. But I'm at the point where I don't wanna wait that long for something and then come to find out it does nothing for me because every day is a struggle for me... it really is. I used to be on adderall prescribed by a different docor for 3 years for adhd. And ended up abusing it because my body got used to it and the side effects were horrible. Although it did help me get through the morning but by the end of the day I felt terrible. So I took it upon myself to get off it it by going to rehab. Now this new doctor doesn't think it's adhd and have me this. I just wanna feel normal. Am I wasting my time and is this generic brand different then the name brand?
