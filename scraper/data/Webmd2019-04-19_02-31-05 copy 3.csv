Oral Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/oral-health/5649/tooth-feels-loose-but-isn-t,Tooth feels loose but isn't!?,"I've noticed that one of my teeth on the bottom front left side of my mouth feels loose sometimes. I've wiggled it and it doesn't seem to move (I don't think) and I've had my mom wiggle to, and she says it doesn't move. Other times it feels normal. I nervous to floss around that particular tooth right now (I usually floss everyday). I brush twice a day and usually use mouth wash once a day.  I'm worried because I haven't seen a dentist in at least five years or so. Lastly I should mention that my jaw pops when I yawn (I'm forcing myself not to do that) and I've noticed it feels sore particularly in the back of my mouth. I can feel it in my face and neck as well sometimes. Don't know if this is associated with my teeth but any help would be appreciated before I see the dentist.

I've been weaning myself slowly 2 yrs ago from 150 mlg, yr or so to 75mlg and about a year ago down to 37.5 mlg. I understand it could take weeks or months for the final withdrawal Understanding that I have purchased several of the recommended supplinents and give it the final go. I've been Venlaflaxine free for 7 days.  I highly recommend decreasing dosages slowly over time because the ""brain zaps"" are intolerable . Even at just 7 days off of the 37,5 mlg I have experienced most of the common withdrawal symptoms only to a much much tolerable degree. Adding some of these supplinents should be very helpful. Fish oil, Q10, B Complex, Ginger root, Magnesium Complex. Perhaps others. Not sure of the dosages in my case but a lot of the fish oil and ginger root had been recommended plus a lot of water, excercise. My Dr. is monitoring my withdrawal process.

They basically used a scalpel and sliced horizontally, cutting it out entirely and then cauterizing the wound. This left a crater-like hole in my lower lip. It has healed some since then, but there is still a very noticeable crater with scar tissue. I have been reading since then that in most cases the doctor makes a small incision, removes the mucocele, and then stitches it back up. My experience seemed much more invasive than that. I think they were rushing and wanted me out of their office as quickly as possible. A couple questions: A. What is the likelihood of this 'crater' healing completely? How much time should it take? It's been ~5 months.  B. If it doesn't heal, is this grounds for a lawsuit? I would rather not but if this guy permanently disfigured my lip needlessly then I would feel compelled to.","Dental Procedures , Mouth Problems"

Around 5 months ago I noticed my right tonsil had become larger than the other and had a yellow spot on it; it didn't cause any pain so I didn't deal with it. A month ago it started becoming irritating when swallowing so I started rinsing my mouth with warm salt water and the spot disappeared (I thought it was a tonsil stone).

I don’t believe it ever got infected: I never had any symptoms of an infection. Since I cracked the molar, I’ve been brushing the cracked molar very thoroughly, including within the recessed area of the fissure down to the exposed root. Relatively recently, approximately 6 weeks ago, I began experiencing a bitter taste in my mouth, which is overpowering when drinking bitter (or astringent) liquids, especially coffee and red wine. I haven’t changed my diet or eating habits for many years, and I’ve been taking the same type of typical once-daily multivitamins for many years. This bitter taste finally motivated me to go to the dentist two weeks ago, also because I have some receding gums with exposed roots (bot NOT gingivitis or periodontitis), and figured it was time to address my gums also. My dentist found NO signs of an infection anywhere in my mouth, but advised that my cracked molar should be extracted (scheduled for eleven days from now), and also that my teeth with the most severely receded gums should be bonded/filled (one was bonded/filled a week ago); and my dentist also observed that my teeth were very clean (probably due to my overly thorough brushing). Over my lifetime, I’ve had many colds, and a few flus and sinus infections, but I’ve NEVER experience this bitter taste in my mouth!

I can tell when he is on pills in several ways... his small pupils, his strained/raspy voice, full of energy, ""happy"" mood but very easily set off. Yesterday I kept checking in on him after his first dose at the clinic and he said he was very calm, more calm than ever before even when he is clean. But at the end of the day he was showing all the signs he does when he is on pills. He assured me he had not taken anything and that it was the Methadone. This morning he went and had his second dose. I've talked with him several times on the phone already and I hear his voice sounds like when he is on pills.  Does Methadone cause the same side effects as Hydrocodone and other opiates? From what I read while researching this is not supposed to be the case. I'm just concerned he may be mixing but he has assured me he is ready to get clean for good and would not risk taking anything because of the random drug tests at the clinic. If he fails one they stop treatment.

I’m incredibly sensitive and always anxious. If someone even slightly raises their voice or scolds me, I’m immedialty crying or tearing up. I’ve been abused emotionally by a “friend” of mine before who used to always be angry with me, now she’s incriminating me and has spread a few lies about me. So, I stood up for myself and had confronted her about it and told her to leave me alone. However that didn’t fix the problem. She has even lied to staff at our school about me and how I bully and ignore her. I feel like I can’t trust any adults there. At home, it’s hardly any better. My father is hardly there, and when he is he is usually scolding or yelling at my brother and I. My brother and are I quite distant and usually never get along, due to often differing opinions and views. My mother, though she is kind and usually the person I go to, often loses her patience and gets quite frustrated and irratated with me. She tries to convince me that I’m not feeling depressed, and that I’m just craving attention and affection. I’m so incredibly lonely and stressed and always feel like I’m doing something wrong. I feel guilty all the time for things I didn’t do, can’t control, or just simple little accidents. I always feel sick and my stomach always hurts. I often get waves of anxiety from just simply sitting in class. I actually do quiet well in school, getting straight A’s and have all advanced classes, but I never feel like I earned anything, or that I’m good enough.  I’ve had too many panic attacks to recall, both small and large. They often happen in cars and at school. At school, they are usually small and nobody is able to notice them so long as I keep my head down and don’t make any noise. In the car they are usually pretty big. I usually choke on my own sobs and tears and am unable to keep my breathing relatively even or stable. These usually last anywhere from 10-30 minutes, depending on how bad it is.  I’ve gone to a psychiatrist before, but it made me feel more guilty than before, that I was taking up someone else’s time. Someone who needed it more than me. So I told my mom who had set up the appointments that it was just a phase. She had gotten angry at me and thinks I’m lying/faking whenever I accidentally cry in front of her.

We still then & now do not know who to turn to.You see for people’s as we, the public & private concerns, as well your own medical origins are without heart,soul,OR concerns CARE” let alone wanting to give you any concern.They ARE beyond offering any at all uplifting OR helping you through the loss & knowledge you will die from this.They are the worst of ever being offered in or to that of real HUMAN CARE”. So here is my post I sent to a person wanting feedback.  Dear America,  I am still at a loss & will continue to feel that way till the end of my life.... Tatiana A. Kostanian My post to my fan mail .... Dear Floyd,  When I first learned I lost my O Negative Kidney due to UCSF a California Teaching Hospital in San Francisco, CA.who gave me wrong meds that was expired I was devastated. I felt in shock with the loss, terribly betrayed. I did not know what to do. I felt like dying.My doctors really were distant & did not apologize to me for their grave mistake.They gave me no options no persons to work through my loss.They abandoned me completely.Here I had volunteered for years to give my blood for all ages my O Blood.Now, even for myself I had no real O Kidney. I was beyond frightened. I had to rely more & more on my husband & daughter, no one else.I had no more way to go to work or help my family with income My daughter,husband were also somewhat insecure as to what would happen to me. Somewhere during those years, UCSF sent two goons to follow us.They actually threatened us all telling us “don’t you dare sue us, or else.” We were frightened as well horrified any Teaching Hospital would both “threaten & warm” us as patient & as a family.We could not understand what was their thinking & why they were so irrational.It was they who gave me wrong meds & expired meds.Why go after us & tell us to back off.?Well short story we were frightened & did not sue.We did not know what they were capable of doing to us.We just knew they had given us wrong meds that were did always wonder what more they were capable of doing to all of us as a family.you run run when you are threatened you know not what to do anything but keep quiet. You know a 15 gauge needle can really keep you quiet as well when you know it will be for the rest of your life. Oh my goodness, we’re we quiet.  I later quietly changed hospitals. The old one made me feel too upset as well the doctor I still had done to me. He also did not keep a very new Ca Dialysis Clinic.The chairs & the sheets,walls had blood spattered all over way after the last patient had left.The hallways were hard to get through as they were strewn through the hallways with beds, wheelchairs, other stuff that no hospital should have in any hallway.We could not even get through the hallways to get to the men’s or women’s rest rooms I became even more upset.To get my mind cleared about this issue of life I wrote a letter to the State about the premises as well who the doctor was in charge.The State came to our site, gave the doctor a letter of discipline for at least 8 things they found in error.That seemed to help me but not entirely.I felt heavily weighed down because I could not sue.I did not know how to relieve myself & over the years the financial aspect on us was unbelievable.Here we already had massive bills,a daughter whose needs were endless,my husbands & mine.We had no one to turn to.We were always feeling upset & scared.I always felt I was going to die. Nobody on my health team told me, my Family anything. To be incommunicado with your medical team IS a terrible situation.It is one main reason of the why I left this bad hospital & medical team.For a States Teaching Hospital this we think is the worst!!! These last 5 months, the head of this hospital on Webster Street,here in SF & my Dialysis through Davita told my husband & I after only about a 12 minute talk & looking at a bit of my medical history,that he would tell my medical team that I was too old for a transplant & if I were to have any surgery I would not make it.There was & Remains so much more of my past& present doctors said & did to me it would make any patient drown mentally.  So now I am age 75. I don’t know who to turn to save my husband & daughter. Together we now just depend on GOD. Yes my meds cost a great deal,we still have no one to talk to or to help us financially. All we can & do do,is lean on God in prayer.  I do remember I wrote to my friend Gavin Newsom, who is Our California State Lt. Governor of what was going on to me & in my Dialysis Care,who now is running for State Governor...He never responded.I wrote many more, nobody responded!!! ....It’s NOT an ideal life going to Dialysis every other day, but then we guess that’s life.  Most of the time when I have strength & not exhausted I go on the Internet & give advice or share my story. At age 75 what else can I do? Don’t give up & don’t most of all give up on you.YOU are still here.Continue to reach out.  I hope my story has helped some.  God Bless & take care... tatiana  May 10, 2018 San Francisco, Ca.  I still don’t know about my rights as a citizen,a patient, a person who has been terribly wronged, an aged person at age 75 and as a person who is a person on this earth. None of this should never happen to any human being any age, especially from a Known “Teaching University” Known Globally who receives grants globally & Locally.  Shame on them .i can’t get over how this could even be allowed yet rubbed from public scrutiny & or from legal avenues, period. All we can hope for is that God will deal with all of them.

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/43247/not-depression,Not Depression,"I’ve a history of severe depressive disorder. Eventually I found a medication mix that works. I know depression personally. I know the warning signs. I have a psychiatrist. What I’m feeling now is not my depression.  I believe I’m reacting to a situation. Somebody who I love and considered my best friend has betrayed my trust, lied to me by omission, prolonged the situation with obviously no thought of the consequences to our relationship or my feelings. I’m angry. I’m really sad. I feel bereaved. I’m incredulous with the behaviour. I’ve lost something that was very dear to me. The situation is not resolved yet but it will be. My mind is not letting me end our relationship but he’s really stuffed up. It’s not a romantic relationship. I’m usually a person who turns away from people who don’t respect my feelings and trust but I’m battling with breaking away from this relationship. I’m shocked and grief stricken. It’s affecting my whole self. The feeling is not at all like my depressive symptoms. I’m pushing the situation to the conclusion but I’ve lost more than money and a car. I really don’t know how to get over this feeling. Obviously time will soothe me but the decision to forgive and not lose my relationship with him is a hard one to make. Nobody treats me like this more than once. I usually turn my back. He’s much younger than me so I believe immaturity is playing a part. He hasn’t acknowledged what and how he has behaved and the fact that this could have been avoided with an upfront and honest confession. I know people screw up. I’m certainly not perfect and have made many mistakes I’m having an internal battle which is affecting me psychologically and physically and mentally. All advice greatly received. All those experiencing grief I have a good ear. I have experience professionally and personally in multiple situations and can give good advice to everybody except myself!!!!","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Abuse Victims , Depression , Eating Disorders , Schizophrenia , Self Harm , Substance Abuse , Bipolar Disorder , Personality Disorders"
Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/51964/where-would-i-get-this-extraordinary-ability-tested,Where would I get this extraordinary ability tested?,"My age is 49, my sex is male, and I am caucasian. All indications are that I have an extremely rare (not sure even how rare, I am sure other people have it, but I could be the only person on the planet to do it at this extreme) autustic ability. Before you read this, please do not dismiss what I am about to say as impossible, because I already had some of this ability tested at my doctor's office and it has atleast been verified that I can do it well enough that it is beyond a normal person's abilities. Furthermore my parents have witnessed me do it all my life. And lastly it took like 8 hours of search on the internet (thats how rare it is to find info on this) to find a reference by a medical doctor who talks about a rare occurence with fibromyalgia that can also happen with autistic patients because of how both disabilities effect the central nervous system. As I understand it, some fibromyalgia and autistic patients only require maybe a 1000th of the stimuli from a sensory gland of a normal person to detect something, because of how their central nervous system gets stimulated so much more easily or reacts much more faster (not sure which). The reference on the internet I found speaks of fibromyalgia patients who can hear the humming of the ballast tubes in flourescent lights that no normal human can hear, because of their central nervous system. That reference also refers to the possibility of it also effecting a fibromyalgia or autistic's sense of smell. In my case, almost all my senses are effected to some extent but smell seems to be effected the greatest. Let me give some examples. When I was around 18. I was in my bedoom behind a closed door, with tape all over the door to keep smells out (thats how sensitive I am to smells), and I am like 40 feet away from the kitchen and my sister cooks a tv dinner (like fish with white wine source). Both my mother and sister are standing 3 or 4 feet from the microwave and can't smell the alcohol. I smell it behind the taped door in my bedoom, from 40 feet away. I also smell odors thru walls, thru pipes, etc. Recently, just happened a couple months ago, I smelled something like a dead animal when I was in a car (the smell was overwhelming to me). Both my parents were in the front of the car and couldn't smell something that was overwhelming to me, and it wasn't until the moving car went for another couple minutes that my parents could finally smell it. So maybe 200 to 300 feet or perhaps more feet in distance before they could pick up the smell. Just another case of how much farther away I can smell stuff then normal people. And as I mentioned earlier my doctors office tested and verified that I wasn't just imagining this ability. I go to a therapist for my autism. The therapist told me that he put a tiny amount of cleaning stuff on a chair to test me (I was unaware that he did it until after the test was over). A patient came in 15 minutes later, and even sat in the chair and could not smell it. Then a patient came in an hour later and sat in chair, and couldn't smell it. Then another in 2 hours, then another in 3 hours. I came in 4 hours later and smelled it, as soon as I opened the door, and could even state where the smell is coming from, the chair. The same therapist also tested me another 20 to 30 times, and each time I correctly identified the smell, and it was a smell that was too weak for normal people to pick up. And today, believe it or not, I smelled better then a gas detection meter. I'm getting tired of typing so will summarize quickly. I lived next to gas stoves for 32.5 years and never reported a gas leak. What are the mathematical odds, if you pick a random day in 32. 5 years to just report that you smell gas and there really is a leak, and it is just coincidence? The gas man is saying it is impossible because his meter (which apparently isn't as accurate as me) didn't pick up the smell in the hallway, when I smelled gas coming from a neighbor's apartment. Never reported something like this in 32.5 years of being around gas stoves. The day I reported it, the gas man, goes into the apartment and checks the stove and there is a leak (I was correct). And just to be clear again: I walked in front of every apartment in the building, didn't smell gas at any, except for the one where the gas man actually said there was a leak and I never reported a gas leak in 32.5 years of being around gas stoves. It would be around a 1 in 60,000 (or higher) mathematical probability that it was done by random chance. The gas detection meter couldn't detect the gas in the hallway, but the only way I could of known which apartment out of all of them in the building had the leak, and the only way I could of reported this on the correct day of the leak (when I never reported a gas leak in 32.5 years) is it was NOT random chance or coincidence. At this point, I really like to find out what is going on and get as close to an exact number to how much better I smell then a normal person. I live in Pennsylvania, but I could travel if necessary.

These thinking patterns reinforce negative thoughts or emotions. While it might seem that ways your mind can be misperceiving reality might be limitless, actually distorted thinking can be boiled down to 10 types. Whenever you find yourself following any of these 10 thought patterns, your brain is lying you and you may need help to redirect your thinking...but you can recognize this for yourself. Stop and question yourself, if you find thought looping in any of these patterns: 1. All-or-nothing thinking: looking at things as absolute where every thing is either black or white with no in-betweens.  2. Overgeneralization: thinking that how you feel right now is how you will feel always in a never-ending pattern of defeat. 3. Mental filter: going through life filtering out any positives in a situations and only seeing the negative aspect. 4. Discounting the positives: when something good happens you give credit to luck, a mistake or anything except your own ability to make good things happen for yourself in your life. 5. Jumping to conclusions: feeling you can mind-reading (assuming that people are reacting negatively to you) or tell fortunes (predicting that things will turn out badly). 6. Magnification or minimization: you focus on things in a way that either falsely makes them larger than they are or discounts them entirely. 7. Emotional reasoning: reasoning from how you feel “I feel worthless, so I may family would be better off without me."" 8. “Should” statements: internally criticizing yourself or other people with a set of unrealistic, false or make-up guidelines of how people should be/act. 9. Labeling: saying, “I shouldn't be alive,” or “I’m a loser,” when in truth you made a mistake or didn't get something perfect the first time. 10. Blame: blaming yourself for things you were not responsible for, or you blaming others or events when you contributed to a problem. If you find yourself caught in any of these thought patterns, your thinking is distorted not your whole life. If you change your thought, using cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, you will find. things will change.",

I'm clueless and I'm kept thinking of it through days and night even i can't sleep well. It's made me feel so depressed stress and tension at the same time. In result of it.. im absence going to works for days and weeks .. im rather being alone than be with my kid and wife.. at some points I left my family for four days without any news..  During the time when I'm alone, i kept thinking about the problems and issues i am having and its tear me down. Some times I stare to the mirror and surprisingly I've been sitting front of it almost for two hours without knowing how the times fly and its just an empty gaze. I can't recall what I've been thinking about back then.. Lately i found that when I'm starred at the mirror i saw like the reflections of my face slowly disappeared and im gone with it..

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/50670/over-identification-under-identification-with-a-diagnosis,Over identification/Under identification with a diagnosis,"Most people who go to some kind of doctor for mental health problems do so with some type of cognitive distortion going on in their life. This results in patients who take the label given to them and often either over identify or under indentify with it. Under identification happens more in males. This causes the person to discount the diagnosis, shun treatment and often rely on themselves to self-medicate. They rely on friends and family to enable their actions and never move toward wellness. Over identification, more so in women, causes people to over embarce their diagnosis and make it into their identity and personality. They are prone to looking up and asking for more and different meds and enjoy hanging out with people with the same diagnosis, commiserating but never moving toward wellness. A healthier way to respond to a diagnosis is to educate yourself on effective treatments. Anyone who has been in the mental health system will soon realize, it is up to them to check on appropriate meds and seek out alternative therapies, as normally within the system, there is no planned end game. The role of a diagnosis is to discover what is wrong and correct so you will be able to move toward wellness and full functionality.",

Occasionally I can hear people whispering and laughing ( even though it's silent), I also have very intense mood swings, sometimes I get angry for absolutely no reason, and I can't control myself, other times I'll be very happy and I don't feel like myself at all, sometimes I get in a lovey mood and I can see myself typing without actually typing?? I'm usually very monotone, not really emotional but not unemotional, I get told my voice is very plane and with no emotion and other times, people tell me I sound high pitched or emotional ( without being in an emotional situation) I also seem to talk to myself a lot, having conversations and responding to questions no ones asked, as if someone asked them but I didn't think them myself, what could it be?","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression , Schizophrenia , Self Harm , Bipolar Disorder , Personality Disorders"

While hospitalized I found an AMAZING Dr who treated me & he discovered I was BIPOLAR 1 (the worst kind). Extreme highs, extreme lows with Psycotic features. It was a very scary time, hearing and seeing and talking to my sister whom had passed away many years ago it was like she was sitting next to me! Telling my landlord our building was going to Blow up! Seeing airplanes in the sky and the Eagles (Don Henley my favorite singer was telling me he was coming to rescue me). Giving money away to strangers, thinking I could fly, completely rearranged my apartment blocked myself in! Found myself in the basement of my building trying to fix the wiring then walking in the middle of the night to Walgreen's waiting for the pharmacist and staff to arrive, then hearing Ambulances everywhere, listening to music it was all in Spanish. Then walked to the closest hospital to the front desk looking for help with no HELP! NOW I take my medication AS prescribed I do not self medicate I do NOT drink alcohol, I've lost 20lbs which I couldn't afford to loose and I had stopped eating & sleeping. I know I need to eat healthy meals at least 5 times a day as I cannot eat big meals at once!

I also belong to EA (Emotions Anonymous) free group meetings, you can find a group near you by Googling EA and you ZIP code). I do hope this helps! My success story!

She was brought to my mother's house because her boyfriend could not handle her. What follows are details regarding her behavior: -She won't stay put, & if she does, it's not for very long -Won't stop touching and moving around random objects, opens random cosmetic bottles and rubs the lotion on herself -She talks to herself about random things ( she'll see a tobacco commercial and say ""smoking kills, ***! haha"" or she'll say, because I'm on my computer, ""Hey find me that picture where they're sitting at the table cause yeah, yup."" -Slurs her speech -She's gone through a couple of mood swings from neutral emotion to crying -Can partially communicate; follows directions (not for very long though) -She sways her body back and forth in an almost possessed way -Rambles incoherently -Sings randomly, speaks in a child's voice  -Doesn't answer questions fully Her drug test is negative, although she has a past of taking nitrous oxide canisters and other drugs. The last account I have of her acting normally was on April 16th, it was my birthday. She had recently gone on a trip and she confessed to taking an excess of muscle relaxers, however we don't know when she took them, when she started taking them, or how often she takes them. She also confessed to doing cocaine, however we also don't know when she took it, although I suspect she's only done it only a handful of times. Though my mom wants to keep her a couple more days and try to heal her at home, i.e., watching over her, putting her to bed, making sure she's eating and drinking water, giving her vitamins, etc. I'm extremely concerned about her; her boyfriend has booked an appointment on Monday for her to be evaluated at Texas Behavioral Health Center, however I'm not sure what my mom wants to do; I have told her we need to see a professional very soon.",
Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/51470/gf-depressed,GF Depressed,"I am 16 and my gf is 16 and we have been together for nearly two years and us both are pretty mature when it comes to our age. She has depression and when we first started dating it was obvious that she didn’t like her appearance but as we progressed in our relationship she would get very down on herself and get into episodes of bad depression. She didn’t start cutting until the third time she had an “episode” and when that happened I immediately informed her sister who is very close with her both in age and friendship. She tried breaking up with me two times because she felt as if she wasn’t good enough and that I deserved better. I forgot to put this in sooner but this is caused because her dad, before he passed, was abusive and praised her sister and treated her like nothing. In late February of 2018 she once again tried breaking up with me and did because normally I could tell when it was an “episode” but it didn’t seem like one at that point. Later that night I got home from practice for my sport at 10 pm and I saw that she had sent me pictures on Snapchat. The pictures were her arms covered in blood so I told her sister what she had done but before her sister had seen the text my girlfriend sent me another picture with the caption “I finally got a deep cut” so I freaked out thinking she was bleeding terribly and text her sister in a panic basically telling them to get her to a hospital. Little did I know that this would keep her in a psychiatric hospital for about two weeks. When she got out she apologized and we were back together because we shouldn’t have been separated in the first place. She seems like she is doing well for a little bit and then she has to start day treatment which was like a group meeting for people similar to her. She got upset a few times during these three weeks because she felt like a crazy outcast. 2 weeks later and we are in the middle of April and every once in a while she says that she “feels numb” to where she doesn’t feel emotion which causes her to cut to feel pain so it isn’t as numb. As we get into late April and now May 4th 2018 she gets worse and worse. From today, May 4th, she has been numb for about 6-8 days straight and it is so bad that she doesn’t even have energy to do anything anymore. No energy to talk, walk, move and zero motivation for everything. Her self-hatred is at an all time high and her antidepressants and other medications don’t help her at all, she had a plan to commit suicide in the summer but her mom, her sister and I have figured out ways to prevent this. I love my girlfriend so much and I’ve been through so much with her but I have no idea where to turn to next, she is getting worse and worse and I just wanna see her happy again so I turn to this to try and get answers or suggestions from anybody that has gone through something similar. P.S on the day before making this post, May 3rd, she had tried to sell her body and give a random guy her address just so she could get people to stop caring, this obviously didn’t work and the only people that know about how bad her depression is, is her family, a few of her friends and me.","Abuse Victims , Depression , Self Harm , Bipolar Disorder"

It has been difficult reading many of your responses; particularly those regarding marijuana and other medications. I applaud you for completing the NAMI courses and taking time to educate others, but those courses don't replace medical school. As someone who has covered the Nami information and then some I can say you are wrong on so many levels. Your responses to medications in particular are usually inaccurate. Additionally, I'm pretty sure that Nami advises against doling out that kind of advice specifically because you don't have the knowledge or expertise.  Regarding the cannabis...you sound like a D.A.R.E. mom from the 80's and I just hope that you realize it is a lifesaver for some. You are wrong about the lack of research. There is enough research out to encourage further investigation as it has already been applied successfully to so many illnesses. Sometimes you present statements that aren't facts so I implore you to cite your information more frequently. Considering around half of mentally ill patients have a substance abuse issue I'm surprised you crap so freely on your counterparts. I've tried really hard not to be mean or chew you out by citing specifics but I will say it is disgusting to see someone with a mental illness who has suffered stigmatization encouraging the stigmatization of anyone who uses cannabis to seek relief from the plethora of ailments it can address when used properly. Mine was prescribed by a doctor and it has reduced the number of psychotropic medications I need.  Lastly, back to the pharmacology of disorders...some people with severe mental illness need to be heavily medicated because when they are not they are a danger to themselves or others. You do not seem to get this? Some don't have the luxury of a beautiful turnout.  So in closing stop playing doctor and give advice that you can relate to. It sounds more genuine. For example if someone wanted to know about different psych wards, restraints, psychosis, delusions, encounters with police when manic, ect's, approximately 100 different psychotropic medications, talk therapy, group therapy, medical cannabis, I'd do that because it comes from experience. You sound and again no offense like you completed a NAMI class and an abnormal psych course at a community college.

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/50436/anxiety-as-a-useful-natural-bodliy-response,Anxiety as a Useful Natural Bodliy Response,"Normal anxiety is part of the body’s natural defense system. It's an alert to a threat that is unknown, vague, or comes from your own internal fears. While you’re in this state, your feelings can range from a vague sense of worry to physical sensations such as a pounding heartbeat. These feelings make you want to react to the threat. An anxiety response is normal in many situations. Anxiety is a signal from your brain that warns you of a threat and is a normal response to help you prevent something or decrease the bad effects of something you can't control. If you did not have this natural response to harmful situations, you would be unable to prevent harm from entering your life.  When you feel anxiety, you first response should not be, ""How to I get rid of this feeling?"" but ""What is wrong in my life or environment that my mind is signaling my body with discomfort so that I move away from or change my circumstances or environment."" Much as stress is a natural response to allow you to fight, flee or cope with a sensory overload of emotions, workload, or situations to deal with, anxiety is your mind signalling your body to be afraid of some sensed danger. Before taking meds or substances to mask you body's natural defense system, look to understand what realities in your life may need to be dropped, handled or coped with by actual action.",

Clinical research is time consuming and underfunded. Crowdsourcing a huge databank that researchers can tap into could potentially point out trends that we didn’t know existed, and cut the amount of time and money that it takes to run clinical study. Ultimately, this will hopefully drive us towards a cure faster. iConquerMS is empowering people to take an active role in research, and helping them shape their own futures. Members of these patient power research networks (PPRNs) are doing what we really should have been doing since the beginning- interacting with researchers as equals, not just as patients or subjects in a trial. By actively participating in research we are helping to ensure that the focus is on issues that are impactful and meaningful to our communities.  PPRN’s are a relatively new and novel way of conducting research, but we are already seeing results. Nearly $20 million has been invested in four exciting new studies so far. These studies address highly relevant issues, and have the potential to have a real impact on the MS community. These include studies that will compare the effectiveness of different disease modifying drugs, and medications used to treat fatigue (which is one of the most common and most debilitating symptoms that many people with MS face). Other studies will assess whether we can use telehealth and technology to bridge the gaps in care, so that all people living with MS, not just those who live within driving distance to an MS center, have access to rehabilitation and specialists.

I'm 16, about to turn 17 in approximately 2 weeks. A year ago I was experiencing sudden thoughts of suicide, a strong depression, I also smoked a lot, drank a lot, went out to a lot of parties, felt hollow, senseless and experienced depersonalization frequently. I didn't live with my parents and nobody really supervised me, it was easy to trick my parents from a distance. I got deep into alcohol and probably risked my life in some situations. I saw myself while standing in the sidewalks throwing my body to the cars rushing by, the thoughts of suicide got stronger and stronger and everyday I was at the border of it but never got to hurt myself because I saw it as being weak and I didn't want to call attention. One time it got really bad and was close to kill myself, it was a discussion with myself. I've tried to kill myself twice I think, the first time was when I was 10. I've always felt depressed with moments of happiness but never gotten out of that hole. I moved on the alcohol and smoking after 3-4 months of all that. When my parents finally moved to the city they took me with a neurologist because I couldn't sleep, a few weeks before that aid started smoking weed to solve my sleeping problems, I never did it with the intention to get high or fit in. When the neurologist asked me if I had ever smoked weed or tried drugs said yes, my parents were shocked but I told them it was normal, the neurologist told them so but warned them of some things. My dad is a cop...so...yeah... After that everything went south. By that point in my life I started to experience hallucinations and hear voices before sleeping, that was what was not letting me sleep. All that happened to me before smoking weed. I didn't experience the voices getting worse or the hallucinations getting worse after smoking it. But my parents went crazy with knowing I had smoked weed, they didn't know I was currently smoking it. In summary they wanted to get me out of school and a lot of very drastic stuff. My life was *** at that point I was feeling detached from reality and a feeling of not being real. I only heard the voices before sleeping and could really differentiate what they said except for some vague words. When I told that my parents they didn't believe me and told me everything was in my head and I had the power to control it...well various nights I tried to shut those voices and they didn't stop, my parents didn't support me with that and I don't believe they will. Now my life is different from a year ago, I've been more than 6 months sober and 8 without smoking. Those things before were as background in case it is connected with the recent stuff. In September of 2017 I had a terrible experience, I don't know how to call it so I would like you to help me put it a name if there even is one. I felt depersonalization and a crushing fear someone was coming after me, I saw silhouettes and shadows rushing by and coming to me. The fear I felt was immense, I couldn't even move, I started crying and holding my head which I felt light, very very light and hollow. I sat on a couch in the living room with the lights off and saw myself in the mirror, the mirror didn't follow my movements and the fear kept getting worse and worse, the mirror started talking to me. I noticed that my face in the mirror was deformed and couldn't differentiate who's face was it, but I could tell it wasn't mine. I started having a conversation with the mirror. When the fear was gone I went to my room and went to sleep, like nothing happened. That same month I was in my room and started feeling lightheaded and something felt wrong, so so wrong, I couldn't tell what it was. Then I saw a big mirror in my room and stared at myself, I saw my face and started giggling uncontrollably, then tears started rushing from my face, the mirror started to talk to me and offered me to tell me the truth. I'm a person of science and really like to get to the bottom of things, investigate what causes things and it's consequences. That really caught my attention and started to talk to the mirror, he told me that he would show me things that no one has ever seen and a truth that no man knows, that he would take me to a place where no man has been. He told me that in exchange for that I had to give him my body, full and absolute control of my body. I argued a little with him for why that was necessary but he didn't convinced me, the conversation ended up in that he would demonstrate me that truth and I would give him my body. At the end of that month I felt that lightheadedness again, a sudden boost of energy, my heart beat raised to 160 at rest, I felt very dizzy and my head hurt a lot. I went to my room and looked at myself in the mirror, when I realized I was speaking to the mirror again, but this time he was being aggressive and made me feel bad, I cried a lot, felt weak, I was texting with my girlfriend who knew of all of this. The mirror told me that I had to get rid of her, that she was just standing in my way and nanotubes letting me see the truth, I argued with him and begged him that he didn't take her away from me. He was very rude and kept screaming at me. I ended up crying and felt to the floor, he didn't let me stand up. While all of this was happening I told my girlfriend through texts. I don't remember the rest Other things like this happened but there was one time I started to feel weird, odd, lightheaded, in a state of alert, with a lot of energy and powerful. I saw a silhouette that was going around the house and it told me to follow it so I did, we only went in circles for a bit until we reached the roof and told me to look at my shadow and listen to it so I listened to my shadow, which then told me that he would demonstrate me what I'm really capable of, after that I didn't have control of my body and just laid my back on the floor while looking to the stars and the voice told me to look to a particular star, then the star suddenly disappeared so I was amazed, then the voice started to disappear stars and appear stars like crazy. Then he told me to do the same, to see what I was really capable of, so I was disappearing stars at will and creating others, it was amazing. Then he told me that everything that I saw was a lie, that everyone was living a lie and I had to show everyone the truth. Then He told me to look at the sky and look closely, then I saw like if the earth was in some kind of dome, like if it was in a glass globe and made me see how fragile and small we truly are, it was an amazing and indescriptible experience. After that I went to my room and laid in my bed, after some moments my body felt hollow, and light, then I saw my own body face to face, like if I was floating, then went floating at a high speed and saw the city from above, my house and everything. My brother noticed something in me but I didn't tell him anything because he didn't believe me in the past with things like that. After that the mirror has shown me a place that looks kind of mystical and told me it's called the red dimension, it sound like a fantasy game thing but I've seen it. As time went by these experiences have decreased and I don't remember anymore what the mirror tells me. Now I've noticed that my behavior has been erratic, I've had fits of anger, irritability detachment from friends, my girlfriend told me I've been distant (very rare in me), paranoid, anxiety is crushing me everyday, I feel fear at nights, I can't sleep because of this, I have a sensation something is coming for me or is reaching for me, I have a lot of difficulties to concentrate which are to the point of interfering with my everyday life, I have to read something several times to get a grasp of it, I normally read a lot of scientific texts and I'm used to read long texts with unfamiliar words but now I can't even read a paragraph and get it's content, I have difficulty finding words, my speech has been hard to understand to people which it hasn't been in the past, then has been moments when I stand up not that fast and start feeling very dizzy, and my vision gets noisy and black, then I fall to the floor, it takes me a few seconds to regain consciousness. Among other things The main thing that I'm concerned about is that now I hear voices, but this time is different. The voices speak to me at all times and say random things to me, sometimes they say really really bad things. They make me doubt of my family and people in general. My brother noticed something was wrong with me and the voices told me that he wanted to know my secrets and that I should kill him before he knew all that is happening to me because he would tell my family and they would lock me up in some kind of mental hospital. I argued with the voices about that being very drastic and if there was no other way to avoid that but I can't remember what we concluded. What the voices tell me makes sense to me, when I tell my girlfriend about what they tell me or a friend they tell me that those things aren't real and don't make sense and that I need help. Sometimes I really feel I need help and believe something is wrong with me, but other times I think nothing's wrong with me and I'm normal. Now I'm worried I will hurt my self or others because of the these thing that are happening to me. The voices also repeat random words in my head, they say random things and repeat them on and on or sometimes phrases and then I realize I'm repeating them too. My native language is Spanish and I'm living in México, but the voices talk to me in English, the mirror talked to me in English, every time I've talked to something that isn't real has been in English and that's how I know it isn't real. I sometimes find myself talking to me and then think I'm crazy and the voices tell me that I'm just having a conversation with myself and there's nothing wrong about it. Then I asked a friend if somethings also happened to her but she said no to everything and was very weirded out about everything. Then I told her about everything and she told me I needed help. Every night I can't sleep, the voices get loud and don't let me sleep, the anxiety gets heavier and my thoughts just rush and I feel a crippling fear. Every morning the voices wake me up, they get loud and just wake me of my sleep, thoughts rush and I am just not sleeping anymore. Now I rarely eat and my personal hygiene has deteriorated a lot, I have not taken care of myself lately like I used to. I have also had a lot of tics and been kind of on alert at every moment, but when some people talk to me they have to repeat themselves because I'm just gone, talking with the voices and zoned out. I realized that things that I believed were actually delusions, like I thought a teacher was trying to abuse of me, when in reality he was instructed by the principal to closely look at my behavior because they knew about the weed. I have a lot of thinkings like this and even though I make sense out of it and look at the ""truth"" I get back at what I initially believed and get all paranoid and doubt of everyone and myself. My memory is getting even worse now, I can't remember things that happened 5 minutes ago or even seconds, as well as events from years ago, weeks or months very clearly. But there's moments when I feel ""enlightened"" and remember a lot of things and can clearly talk and write down my symptoms and things that happened to me, like I did with this text. I was diagnosed with epilepsy (it is not a serious type of epilepsy, my left hand just shakes) and migraine approximately two weeks ago, since then I have taken Topamax, I don't think it has had a big impact on me to show these symptoms. I started to worry when I put all my symptoms in the symptom checker by WebMD and the top result was Schizophrenia. I know it's a beta but it got me worried by how a lot of things matched when I did some research. My parents basically don't really believed psychologists and I don't think they'll take me to one so I'm on my own, I don't know what to do and everyday is getting harder. The constant fight with myself and the voices is just exhausting, I don't like myself or my mind. I need help but don't know what to do since I'm not independent.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression , Schizophrenia , Personality Disorders"

Usually once or twice a month for a couple days. I am not ill, and I am not allergic to anything besides specifically eyelash adhesive. I'm in good health besides my weight. I am 100 lbs overweight but currently trying to lose it. I've had this lymphnode issue going on since I was eleven years old, but at the time I had only one, now currently I'm 22 with three more grown. The tongue node being the more recent and it inhibits my speech while being uncomfortably big.  Should I be worried of the issue? I have seen two doctors before. One has told me my salivary ducts are clogged and my remedy was to literally eat sour candy or fruit. My other doctor has acted like it's no big deal and didn't care to even test me for it.

Does she understand why the clinical trials showed nothing promising?  Correlation - A laptop computer running Windows 10 OS to the human brain running CNS proteins OS. Hard drive is the brain itself. Software is chromosomes which carry proteins which make the brain function properly.  Chromosomes with deletions, mutations, additions, displacements, - hard drive is bad. Proteins such as Lingo-1 which are only malfunctioning, - software problem. When we have a problem with malfunctioning programs on a laptop, we run diagnostics, re-program, then reboot the system. Problem solved. If we have a way to communicate with a problematic protein such as Lingo-1, we can do the same thing. Lingo-1 negative regulatory protein is Leucine rich, which gives us our mode of communication. Being the only essential amino acid which the human body cannot synthesize and must be imported through diet, - we basically - by controlling Leucine intake through mathematically calculated dosages and time frames, as well as using BIIB033 as a useful tool, are telling Lingo-1 how to function properly. Once the re-programming is completed we simply reboot the brain. -Sleeping and eating a normal diet again.  The Lingo-1 clinical trials showed nothing promising because there was no communication whatsoever. Simply disabling it once a month with a monoclonal antibody tells it nothing. Once Lingo-1 recovers from being disabled, it is now enabled to go back to acting the way it was before - improperly. I hope this correlation helps Stephanie understand. If so, maybe it will help her, and the medical professionals as well, to think outside the box. If medical science moved as fast as technology we would by now have every human disease state solved.

I had an MRI but have not had one since this issue discussed has started. My dad has MS. 4 weeks ago, I thought I had a migraine. I took the prescribed Cambia and it went away. Next day, it was back and worse. Took the cambia again but it didn't help, took Advil,daily nortriptiline, muscle relaxers, more cambia. Called my neurologist after 3 days and they suggested going to the ER to get an infusion. It helped, until I stood up to leave. The headache was immediately back. This continued to go on, kept taking everything listed above. Two weeks into this unbearable headache, I saw my neurologist again, he for some reason checked my eyes and saw that my optic nerve in one eye looked larger and told me to call an opthamologist. I of course did and went to the appointment where he told me could not rule out that it was normal, but it also wasn't abnormal. So I called the neurologist with that, he asked me to come in to the office, thinking I had a pseuodotumor cerebri and wanted to do a spinal tap to check the pressure and take a sample. The opening pressure was 12. They then sent me for another infusion to help with the still unbearable headache. This was on a friday.This is now week three of this crippling headache. Fast forward to Monday, still unable to stand from unbearable presssure in my head, so bad I can't breathe, pulse racing. Call the doctor, they think it's an anuerism, rush to the ER. They run NO tests and speak with my neurologist who says it's from the spinal tap and says to give me an infusion and rest for 48 hours. Rest 48 hours, it's Wednesday and I've now missed 4 days of work and we're heading into week 4 of this headache. I drive to work, last two hours basically laying on the floor because I still can't stand, my legs and face are numb. I attempt to drive home but make it ten minutes before pulling over and calling for help because the pressure in my head is so bad I can't see and I'm nauseous. I call my neurologist and he calls the ER to tell them I'm coming in for a blood patch. They do the blood patch, most painful thing I've ever experienced and actually pass out from the pain.

When I hear my phone ding I check right away to make sure it’s not the kind of “you’re about to get hit by a ballistic middle” messages like they got in Hawaii. I’m not sure how to explain how I feel all the time, but it’s usually at night, and it’s just a constant feeling of panic that I can’t shake.

New scientific findings show that the brain grows and develops, is changing and his capabilities depend very much on how you feed and use it. Such was reached to speak more often about diet for the brain: what is right and appropriate to eat to raise your brain to give him the energy he needs to help us have an active and fulfilled life. Science teach us that every day of our life 10.000 cells die in the human brain and never regenerate; more…the brain consumes a quarter of the energy of the body and to function well, it needs proper nourishment. Stress, intense physical or intellectual activity are factors that get the brain tired (sometimes faster than we think) and then he sends us signals that it needs fresh forces, specifically food – from here the feeling that we want something to eat when we are stressed or we are under maximum pressure at the workplace. Ideally, in such times, the food we decide to give to our body and especially our brain to be healthy and helpful, not generating unnecessary or subsequent health problems. So, according to nutritionists our brain craves the following foods: - Healthy fats: essential fatty acids can’t be produced by the human body. The most effective omega-3 fats are found in fish oil, but also in soybean oil, pumpkin seed oil or coconut. Oily fish is, however, much more generous. Eat with confidence salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines, trout or sea fruits. - Cranberries: protects the brain from neuronal stress and reduce the effects of neuronal aging, enhance learning capacity and motor skills. - Nuts and seeds: good fats, vitamin E – which influences cognitive ability. Besides nuts, you can eat almonds, cashew nuts, seeds of sunflower, sesame, pumpkin or any other seed. - Tomatoes: tomatoes antioxidants (lycopene) prevents neuronal degeneration that usually lead to dementia or Alzheimer’s. - Broccoli: great source of vitamin K – a positive factor for cognitive and brain functions. - Garlic: not only reduce bad cholesterol and helps cardiovascular system, but also function as an antioxidant in the brain and can fight bacteria more effectively than various antibiotics or other drugs. - Sage and rosemary: rosemary grow by 15% long-term memory storage capacity and sage increase the flow of chemicals that help transmit messages to the brain. - Kiwi: it offers an enormous amount of vitamin C and polyphenols, a substance known as an antioxidant. This substance prevents cell damage caused by oxidation. - Chocolate: it contains phenylethylamine. Often depressed people probably have a deficit of this substance. Do not consume more than one or two pieces of chocolate a day, preferably dark chocolate. Larger amounts resulting in excessive consumption of fat and sugar, which is not healthy. - Avocado: has monounsaturated fats that contribute to blood circulation, experts say, and a good circulation means a healthy brain. In recent years, several studies have shown that both children and adults who have a diet based on processed foods or fast food have trouble concentrating, poor memory, behavioral problems etc., in addition to cholesterol, increasing risk of developing obesity (especially in children) and other diseases. A fair and balanced diet, therefore, not only helps the body to feel good and harmonious, but brain work better, faster, more efficiently.  Some of the resources:",
Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/49478/paranoia,Paranoia?,"I’ve posted in here before trying to explain this feeling, but I felt it tried to write it too quickly(before work) so I’m going to try to explain this more ind depth. I’ll post a link to my last post at the end. A few years ago I was diagnosed with anxiety and some depression(the first one is more of the problem). I had panic attacks in Army basic training, possibly cause from mostly the yelling(especially in a stress escalated environment). I didn’t know before that that I had anxiety, if anything I just thought I maybe worried a bit more than most people. I grew up with strict (but very good, and loving) parents. My mom was a worrier as well so I assumed I just worried like her. After talking to the therapist there I was separated as I had previous self harm scars, and they didn’t like that.  It was disappointed for a while but I’ve pushed past to accepting it. A lot of my anxiety is believed to have come from an emotionally abusive relationship when I was about 16-18ish. My boyfriend was constantly pressuring my into sexual things I was not ready for, even threatening to cheat on me(and doing so) until I was ready. After years of him doing this to me, even him openly talking about cheating like it was funny via social media, I broke it did with him. He all the sudden acted like our relationship was important to him and harassed me, nonstop messages, I had to block his number, all his social media multiple family member numbers and some of his friends numbers as he would not leave me alone. He threatened to kill himself if I didn’t come back even. After this he started posting pictures close to where I live and work(we didn’t live very close by) even pictures of parks right down my street. My family moved me out of the state for a while after contacting the police of his harassment.  I know there’s more that was wrong with our relationship but I think I’ve tried to forget so hard o can’t remember some of the awful things(like they day him and his friend talked about how they would kill his friends girl and I as a joke when they didn’t think we heard). Freaky. Anyway, the last two years I’ve had more panic attacks, from things such as 1) co worker drama 2) criticism with raised voices (even regular criticism makes me shaky and nervous, a few days ago my manager mentioned my section needed me to work a little faster and I started to panic) 3) people yelling 4) action movies, any kind of scary movie no matter how goofy or how much humor they put into it 5) small disagreements with friends/boyfriend. Recently traveling home to see family I flow on a plane. The first way it was about three hours, I had two jack and comes trying to stay calm but didn’t help much. I sweat probably noticeably almost through my clothes, I couldn’t stop looking around, trying to keep breathing even ect. The way back was worse, it was a little over three hours. Passengers next to me noticed. I had rolling panic attacks through the whole flight. It was a nightmare. I’ve flown before about three years ago, nervous but not having problems like this. These had me breathing so hard if I didn’t have my boyfriend with me to try to keep my calm I would have passed out.  Besides panic attacks recently, I’ve had a lot of random angry outbursts. Sometimes anger mixed with sad or scared. I’ve started arguments(I’m very non confrontational until recently). I’ve yelled at a boss in the phone, something I NEVER would have done before. I’ve started a lot of arguments with my boyfriemd(mostly via text) over things I felt strongly frustrated about, letting the argument go on for about a day and a week sir so later realizing a lot of the arguments I started I was not even close to rational. But when I’m in them they feel rational. I get more frustrated than I ever have been before, discouraged a lot more. I’ve recently had a lot of trouble paying attention or focusing on one thing. Even tv shows that I usually like, I can’t focus, I’m constantly talking through (only the last year or so), playing in my phone, thinking of other things that I feel like are important so I try to talk through during the show. I get bored I’m the gym more, less interested some days(I’m a huge fitness fanatic lol, usually 5-6 days a week mostly weight training very little cardio). Some of this info might not bee relevant but I’m trying to think of anything that could be affecting this. I’ve been not necessarily stuttering a lot lately, but the only way I can describe is is talking like I’m dyslexic(I’m not). I get words mixed up not confused with other words but I’ll be talking and say a word wrong. For example instead of saying California pizza kitchen I’ve said California Kizza pitchen. That kind of confusion. And a lot of times I’ll be in the middle of one sentance on one subject and trail off that to something completely different, sometimes multiple times in a few minutes.

I am 17 years old and I really enjoy talking to others and hanging out with my friends. The thing is that my real friends live really far away and I feel really depressed when I am on my home. I have not a lot of friends here and I don't seem to be able to do anything to improve it. I have been trying constantly since I was 14. I have been bullied on primary and junior high school and I think that's the main source of the problem. Therefore I am way too scared to talk to people who I don't know really well and I feel that noone is ever there for me. Also I feel like I can never set a topic in a conversation and that everyone is going to critisize what I say. Please help me :(,Depression

I felt like a chain of generations of this had been broken and that raising her right was my purpose in life. Long story. I have lived with a broken heart for all these years. My husband is a wonderful sweet kind man. But he feels sorry for her because now she is depressed and he had contact and tried to get her to talk to me for years and I never knew. I wondered how he could watch me cry all the time and then call her. My friends went to the four winds when it became apparent how bad I was. I still have my best friend. She has an only child also and they are very close. I talk to her about the pain. Have decided that I've been treated poorly long enough and grieving for years and it is time to let her go. Have been told out right that I am not needed or wanted and that everything she needed she got before she got married and moved out. But she needs her Dad.

I always noticed that he would sound slightly depressed, but so was I and these talks would be our way of releasing that depression and stress. But something happened with his relationship an for a straight month we wouldn't talk much at all.  Today, I received a call from his girlfriend and his cousin telling me that he tried to jump off the balcony of his home. But yesterday he was taken to the hospital because the police found him wondering around the streets half clothed and shoe less. His girlfriend told me that he would change his personality at times to saying things like ""Im God"" or ""Your boyfriend is never coming back"". His parents signed him out of the hospital after this incident, which brings us back to today where he tried to jump of the balcony.  His cousin says that he has moments where he is himself, but it would only be temporary. In addition, once he stops being himself he gets very aggressive towards anyone near him.

I reported to LAPD, city attorney’s office, and APS. Just like a metoo victim, no one takes me seriously. Being a man with a mental disability seems to result in me not being taken seriously.  When I go to my therapist, the “nonprofit” she works for does not care about legal justice. They won’t make calls to the city attorney’s office or the media or elected officials and help me advocate for changes to the law to prevent this from happening to others.  Abusing disabled tenants should be classified and charged as domestic violence for example.  I can’t heal without justice when there’s a chance to attain it especially when it’s not my word vs the abusers’ word - the abuse is caught on video.

I have some questions and was asking for some advice as well..first off, i know thaT i probably cant be given medical advice, but all i want is to have opinions from others, so i can get idea of these symptoms and chractersitics may be.  I have bi polar depression. That i can admit and i actualy embrace it. im always needing someone to talk to and for the most part, im very honest about myself. As for my brother, he has some issues i know hes always had and it seems to have gotten way worse. And making matters worse, i see alot of my moms personality issues in him as well. so anyways heres what is going on. was wondering opinions on possibility of what mental illness it could be. I NEED HELP! He is very manipulative, convinving, and plays the victim role well. hes has tricked me over many yrs of giving in. but, he has costed me alot of problems in my life and i keep forgiving and forgiving..and let him walk all over me. he walks all over my mom and she gives in. everytime i turn aROUND hes hitting people up for money. he plays three different women in one day, he has his wife who worls all day pregnant with two other kids at day care, while hes unemployed and hanging out with other women and friends. seems to me as if anytime he needs somethingh he comes around. there is always an ulterior motive. ive noticed it gets worse. he has stolen from family. hustled money out of my in laws. hustled his wife and rest of family. if he doesnt get mmoney if he asks for it, he mostly likely will steal it. if that doesnt happen he will fioguer out a way. growing up, he was spolied in a sense that he would throw so many tantrums my mom would give int my mom told me know but since he put up a fight, she gave in n i get to watch him eat a candy bar while i didnt get one because i kept quiet took no for an answer. then, theres a side of him, as an adult, if he doesnt get what he wants he targets ur weakmess and uses that with threats. if that doesnt work he will get closer to doing what he threatened. and when he gets what he wants five minutes later, he starts talking and joining a conversation as if nothing happenmed. then, he sees himself as a victim (especially when told no) and makes excuses and blames others for things that were clearly his stupidity. he is blind to his mistakes, but instead points out and twists it onto others. when he wants something he doesnt see anything on his path, doesnt care who hes hurting. hes even let huge mistakes be blamed on others. he dates different women in one day, depemding on what he needs at the time. if he needs money he will leave his wife and kids (of course lying 90% about what hes doing) and he will hang out with a woman til she isnt benefitting him anymore, he will initiate a fight, and move to the next for money or whatever it is hes after. Kee in mind hes also an addict. as i am too, but us being raised in same household one would believe thats not possible. But, also growing up, ive noticed my mom has same characteristics...and then my brother muvh worse. I know its something mental hea;th realated. I admit over ten yrs ago that i wasnt feeling normal mentally, and i sought help by professionals. as far as my mom and my brother, if u try telling them they should seek help, they both blow it off or get defensive and everyone else is the crazy one.

Take slow deep breathes - count as you inhale 1 to 5, then count as you exhale 1 to 5. If it helps think of a work or phrase like ""Peace"" or ""I am enough"" to think while breathing. Repeat 5 or more times. 2. Take a walk outside - a brisk 20 minute walk will give you as much of a serotonin boost as an anti-depressant. If you are not in a place you can walk flex your hands tight and release, then your hands and arms, and then your upper body. Flex tight, hold one second and release. 3. Take a mental vacation - carry a photo of your happy place beach, cabin, sunrise...take a minute sit down, look at the picture and send yourself there mentally noting sounds, smells and the feel of the air around you. With practice, you can do this effectively as needed. 4. Give yourself permission to disengage - know you always have the right to say ""no"", know you can always say, I need a moment"", always know you can disengage from stress and conflict and walk away from any situation without apology. 5. End each day by writing down 5 good things that happened that day. They can be small things but studies have shown that doing this for 3 weeks will change your attitude, improve your life and aid sleep.",

Multiple Sclerosis,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/multiple-sclerosis/74371/numbness-muscle-twitching-and-no-diagnosis-read-this,"Numbness, muscle twitching, and no diagnosis?  Read this.","I felt compelled to write this a year and a half after first experiencing neurological issues because #1, it seems that a lot of folks who have similar undiagnosed conditions simply ""disappear"" online (hopefully that means they've gotten better), and #2, I am still alive after a year and a half, so my goal is to give hope to anyone who is experiencing similar symptoms and have not had any luck with a diagnosis.  First things first. If you have not seen any neurologists, stop reading now and don't do any more research until that appointment. Otherwise, you will go through torturous anxiety and sleepless nights as you try to self-diagnose and likely settle on the worst-case scenario. My post is for those who have had all of the tests done and seen multiple doctors and still have no diagnosis.  My two biggest, longest lasting symptoms were (and occasionally still are) numbness and muscle twitching. It started off as numbness in my left toe, slowly progressing to my left foot, left leg, left arm, left side of the face and even the entire head at times (rarely all at once though). I started getting it in the right side of my body occasionally, but there it typically stayed in my right fingertips. The twitching also appeared in various parts of the body, but really chose to settle in my right arm between my triceps and elbow. It twitched nearly nonstop, 24/7 for 4-5 months straight. While these were the longest lasting symptoms, I encountered a TON of other symptoms. While concerning, these didn’t last months like the numbness and twitching. I will include that list below my signature.  During about a year’s time, I had 2 MRIs on my brain and neck, two different EMGs on both sides of the body, strength tests, probably a dozen or so various blood tests, and an EKG. Everything came back clean. I saw 2 different neurologists and 2 different general doctors. None of them could piece anything together. One of my neurologists wouldn't even look at my twitching arm. “If you can do a push up, sit up, and squat, you don't have ALS,” he assured me. So while every doctor failed to come up with what was going on, none of them seemed overly concerned. In a way, it is a relief to know your doctors aren’t concerned. On the other hand, if they don’t know what it is, then how do they know it’s not fatal?! Before I move on to what finally “cured” me, I need to pause and say… trust your doctors, esp. if they are all saying the same thing. Spending a few hours or even a few days researching WebMD, message boards, etc., does not put us on the same standing as neurologists who have spent YEARS studying these conditions. You have to trust them and have a little faith, esp. if they are saying you are OK. I also know that none of what I’m saying is truly going to convince you that you might not have a terrible disease - I wasn't able to be convinced at first either. They only thing you can truly do is wait it out.  OK, the good stuff. By a fluke chance, I shared my issues and concerns with a co-worker, who suggested that I see a particular doctor in Houston who has a knack for diagnosing things that other doctors can’t. I didn’t get my hopes up but decided to go see him anyway. He took a look at all of my test results over the past year, sent me for a couple more random blood tests, which came back clean, and then told me that he has seen what I have before. It doesn’t even have a name yet! It is a virus and has a transient nature, which explains why the symptoms manifest in different ways and in different places. Furthermore, it is going to take a couple of more years to fully get it out of my system. Annoying? Yes! But at least he gave me hope, which is something I couldn’t get anywhere else. He told me that it’s hard to do, but if I could find a way to laugh with the twitching, to do so (I know, that is impossible), because while with some diseases, twitching is a bad thing, in this case, it is a good thing and is my body’s way of rewiring itself so to speak. So, I’m still not filling confident at this point, but he said he wants to start me on prescription grade magnesium (Mag Oxide, 400 mg), and that if that doesn’t help with the twitching, that he had a less conventional idea. Well, to my surprise, one or two days after taking the magnesium, the twitching stopped almost completely! Mind you, none of my previous tests showed any sort of magnesium deficiency. As a side note, I will still get random twitches every now and then, but they are usually short-lived and nothing more than just a few seconds. But the nonstop twitching has been gone for probably 8 months or so. (I still wonder what his other idea would have been if the magnesium wouldn’t have worked!) So anyway, if you are in the same boat as I am/was, not finding any results and all of your tests coming back clean, ask your doctor if he can try you on a high dosage of magnesium. You certainly don’t have anything to lose.  I want to end this with some self-reflection that has come out of this ordeal with me. This was an extremely scary season for me and forced me to ask some tough questions about life and what really matters. What I learned was whether I have a neurological disease now or not, the fact remains that at some point, I AM going to die. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter if that happens while I am young, middle-aged, or old... the same fate awaits us all. Depressing, yes, but true nonetheless. If you are battling an unknown condition and have extreme anxiety and fear, my advice is to take this time and current health scare to settle the score now. Are you religious? Find out what you truly believe and hopefully this strengthens your faith in the end. Religious or not, try to find beauty in the day to day and focus each day on what truly matters. If and when you come out of this ordeal, be it a year or longer, come back and share your story with others to give them hope. And please don't forget those who truly are suffering with serious diseases such as ALS. Pray for them, encourage them, donate to ALS research, volunteer your time, etc. All the vows you made and said you'd do if only you didn't have the fatal disease? Do them. With whatever time you have left, love God and love others and leave the world a better place. Good luck! DC Other symptoms besides numbness and muscle twitching: Long lasting: High blood pressure; rash in left armpit that lasted months but eventually went away; Left leg tingly, almost like an internal vibration; Psychological issues (Anxiety, Stress, Detached feeling, Overwhelmed, Fear)   Shorter lived: Sensation of lump in my throat, slow swallowing, sometimes with a dull pain that came and went; Muscle and joint pain (shoulders, calves, right arm, muscle near thumb on right hand, finger joints); Waking up with right little and ring fingers completely numb; Electric jolt-like feeling in right side of neck; Loss of appetite and weight loss; Insomnia; Fatigue; Palpitations; Light headed; Stammering for words; Neck pain; Chest pains","Symptoms , Diagnosis"

This is caused by a genetic sensitivity to natural changes that effect your internal circadian rhythms.  While people tend to link mood changes to external events, bipolar in fact it intrinsic and changes happen because of neuro-chemical changes within your body linked to the amount of light and dark that comes into your brain through your eyes. People born predisposed to this sensitivity find that the time two weeks on either side of the spring and fall equinox is when the greatest changes happen in nature. These times are historic highs for bipolar hospitalizations and suicides. Unlike clinical depression that peaks during the summer and winter solaces, Bipolar tend to effect mammals during the equinoxes. Lithium, which is not a drug but a natural base element found in the earth, is one of the few natural elements found to lengthen circadian rhythms thus calming the jarring changes that can throw both man and other mammals into periods of elevated energy and excitement during these periods often followed by periods of lowered activity and energy in both brain and body. between these times, those with bipolar enjoy periods of normalcy even with out medication. Lithium, however is the natural substance which elongates circadian rhythms muting the high and lows to levels that can be controlled.

My friends also notice I tend to randomly stop listening and just enter my thought in the middle of conversations and I kind of hear them put I don’t really think to respond until they touch me or something •I often am anxious and restless and tend to be really fidgety sometimes •I never really have the motivation to do most things like clean, go out, meet up with friend and all kinds of stuff when I don’t need to •I sometimes feel hopeless  •I find it hard to fall asleep •I often have very negative or degrading thought about myself •I have been having problems remembering things. •I started to try to restrict what I eat to loose weight •I am not really sad all the time put I sometimes cry at night and sometimes am almost about to cry but stop it because I don’t want my friends to know I’m hurting, I mostly just feel numb/apathetic. My friend was more excited about my birthday then me (I am 13 so it’s not that I hate getting older or anything) I am also strangely not that excited for a trip to London I am going to with my mom on Easter. •I often feel guilt about feeling this way or guilty that I don’t do more productive stuff •I am really apologetic, I am always apologizing for everything. •I fake happiness when I really feel numb or sad. I pretend to be happy and cheerful and try to do it everyday because it really doesn’t matter. •I am often very tired or have low energy but can’t sleep and still feel it after a good rest I doubt that I have depression because I don’t feel sad too often, maybe like a short sad period every day or crying every other day.  Is it depression when sadness is fairly limited and it’s more like worthlessness or apathy?  Am I just being dramatic?

BMI 24.2. Mother with hip fracture in her 80s. DXA indicates osteoporosis is worsening despite treatment with Fosamax and then Reclast (2018, 2017, 2010, & 2009. I am scheduled for another infusion in March of this year. Report from DXA scan in September 2018 concludes my 10-year fracture risk is 51% for major osteoporotic fracture and 39% for hip fracture. The previous scan in 2016 was 48% and 36%. Daily intake: calcium citrate (1260 mg) and vitamin D 2000 IU (blood level in July 2018 was 54). I cut down from 20 mg to 10 mg of omeprazole daily a year before the 2018 DXA. In 2004-5, I took prednisone (starting at 80 mg) for 18 months for polymyalgia rheumatica. Also took prednisone for some time in the late 1980s for tendinitis. In addition, I was on a small dose of Accutane for at least a year during the 1990s for acne rosacea. I did not do any regular exercise/walking. Despite a torn meniscus, I have recently started walking 1 mile 4 times a week and have joined the YMCA where I am in PT for the knee and back pain (arthritis and stenosis), as well as balance and fall prevention including Silver Sneakers Tai Chi and Yoga. My rheumatologist wants me to have Reclast for 2 more years and then switch to something else (assume Prolia, though I don’t like the side effects I read about, especially increase in cholesterol since I already take a statin and have a lipoprotein-a score of 84). A 2009 article on webMD entitled “Do Bone Tests Help Monitor Ostoeporosis? Study Shows Bone Density Tests May Be Misleading for Patients Getting Bisphosphonates” by Salynn Boyles, states: “Even if the test were completely accurate, bone mineral density testing is not a particularly good measure of fracture risk, says Juliet Compston, MD, University of Oxford professor of bone medicine.” Another article reviewed in July 2018 on webMD entitled “Monitoring Osteoporosis Therapy: The controversy of bone density testing in patients already taking osteoporosis medication” makes me wonder if my worsening fracture scores are an accurate indication of fracture risk. At what point can a person stop treatment, and how concerned should I be? My primary care physician is very concerned. Thank you!",

Osteoporosis,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/osteoporosis/48130/re-low-bone-density-from-jane-age-65,"re: low bone density...from Jane , age 65","After BrCa treatments for estrogren + in 1997-98, I was treated with many drugs (fosamax, prolia to name a couple) to combat my osteopenia. I exercised, did wt lifts, walking, calcium supplements ...not much improvement. After a vacation from bone building prescription drugs for a couple of years, I was prescribed yet again a new oral drug Actavis-Risedronate Sodium to help my bones as I was 63. After about 5 months of faithfully taking this med, I started to have severe bone/joint pain and was limited in my exercise routine. So with medical oversight, I stopped taking the risedronate and improved somewhat in QOL. I was referred to a bone mineralist specialist who ran a new bunch of tests, 24 hour urine collection, Mg, calcium and parathyroid levels included. The whole 9 yards. Never had this done before. I followed the testing criteria to the T.  That was the revelation I needed. I got the test results online before following up with my bone mineralist dr. I finally saw that my parathyroid level was elevated at the same time my blood calcium was elevated. I did a lot of research on the Internet and discovered I probably had hyperparathyroid DZ. So after more testing and medical HX reviewed, I was accepted as a pt at the Norman Parathyroid Center in Tampa, FL and they found and excised my parathyroid tumor and left the other 3 normal parathyroid glands intact as they were behaving and were normal in hormone production. Day surgery by very skilled doctors. The Norman Parathyroid Center does about 15 parathyroid surgeries a day. I flew there from Dallas, TX.  So I expect my bone density test to be much improved one year after this neck surgery and I take vit D/Calcium supplements, work out, stay active. That is it. Of course, watch the alcohol, diet sodas...normal advice for anyone. When the parathyroid is stealing calcium from your bones, there is no amount of oral calcium or bone building drug that can over come that powerful hormone effect. There is some medical discussion (from a chemo nurse presenter at a Br Ca support group) that chemotherapy can have an effect on the endrocrine system and may have played a part in my one parathyroid tumor, but my Tampa, FL surgeon, Dr. Daniel Ruan, said it was just my bad luck and I could live my life w/o worrying about this problem recurring. Hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed, though relatively infrequent in the gen pop.  So bottom line, go to a bone mineralist specialist and get all your labs and Look at them to see what is going on with your bones... Don't let the drs assume you are just old or just a Br Ca survivor and that is just a normal part of your situation. My bone mineralist dr did not agree with my lay person diagnosis and he wanted to put me back on Fosamax again for a year then check me again. With my bone density on the line, I said no, I need a 2nd opinion and that is how I finally got the right diagnosis for me. People, you need to know your lab results and take charge of your health. Good luck to you in your pursuit of good health and strong bones. Without the bones, life is not too rosy.",

Multiple Sclerosis,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/multiple-sclerosis/86499/constant-left-arm-pain---m-s-starting,Constant Left Arm Pain - M.S. starting?,"About 4 months ago I started getting pains in my left arm. Original starting spot was Elbow area only. Then it expanding to about 3"" below the Elbow but, not always both directions sometimes just one. Now periodically pain will go to ends of my fingers and/or top of my shoulder.  The pain area changes as well as the pain severity frequently but the area that is constant, literally daily, is upper/outer elbow down about 3"" to upper/outer forearm. Since it was changing frequently I kept telling myself it's a severely pulled muscle or nerve just needing to work itself out so I've never been to see the Dr. However, about 1-2 months ago the pain severity has become so excruciating that I literally cannot pick anything that weighs more than about a pound. The pain was originally just annoying and a step above uncomfortable...now it's always pretty much unbearable throbbing with occasional stabbing. After the 1st month I started laying on my left side with arm straight out and on top of my heating pad. Felt like it was providing relief but after a while not so much. So, I started wrapping heating pad around my arm, securing with an ace bandage but is almost hurting more. I've been getting periodic stabbing and throbbing pains through both legs, and upper shoulders for about a year but my arm pain came on so quickly and intensely that I gave in and made a Dr appointment last week but it's not until week after next. I'm starting to worry now so does any have any ideas, suggestions, comments...anything?

Osteoporosis,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/osteoporosis/56972/comfy-shoes-for-borderline-osteoporosis,Comfy shoes for borderline osteoporosis,"I just want to share about some fabulous shoes I found for serious walking, even with my borderline osteoporosis. My last Tcell count was -2.5. I am age 64 and weigh 115lbs. I had 3 metatarsal stress fractures (both feet involved) in the 4 years leading up to this diagnosis, each episode caused just by walking too many hours in the mall or on pavement in medium-supportive shoes (Skechers and others).  I was scared to death to go on an 8-day London vacation this past June, which was to include a lot of walking. First I packed my giant orthopedic boot, which took up a third of my suitcase (I didn't want to be shopping for one in London while in extreme pain from a broken foot). Then I tried on an entire store full of women's ""walking"" shoes, also many other expensive walking shoes in other stores, with and without various inserted arch supports. I didn't find anything any better than my existing walking shoes with added arch support which, while comfortable enough just for standing, always made the metatarsal area of my feet feel dangerously achy-breaky after any serious walking.  Long story short: the dream shoes I finally found are Hoka One One brand running shoes, their model called Clifton 4. They have the most marshmallow-cushy sole I've ever felt, with a slightly rounded rocker-like bottom surface that prevents the ""slap-down"" motion of the front part of my foot that happened when I walked in all those other shoes. But most noticeable was the unique amount of extra cushion precisely under my metatarsal bones, that I had felt in no other shoe I tried on. I bought them in a half-size larger than my street shoes, in Wide width that gave my toes plenty of room to stretch out side to side and up and down. I laced them very loose over the metatarsal area, and tight at the top to prevent slipping on the heel. The shoestrings stayed loose and tight where I needed them to. I walked my legs off in London, and felt like I was bounding along the whole time. At the end of a day, my leg muscles were sore from more walking than I'm used to, but my actual feet were not sore at all. And that has NEVER happened to me. These shoes are literally worth their weight in gold! So if you're in my boat, I recommend looking in shoe stores dedicated to serious runners. I've read there are other runners' brands now offering the same sort of extra cushion and rocker motion.",

We don't pull any part of the hair of the head and usually hair pullers don't pull other areas of the body we don't just pull anywhere.It it starts with a throb or pounding in the center of our brain and it hurts a lot and there's no pill to stop the pounding that hurts so bad our head is pounding inside and it just builds up more and more and it creates a horrible pain deep within the brain and the only way to stop the pain is to relieve some of that hair that we pull which is just a temporary fix but really it's deep within the brain that hurts us it's not the hair. When we pull one strand at a time it's releasing some chemical within the brain which we feel we can actually feel the chemical release. And we the suffers all experience the same exact symptoms so it's not in our head we all understand that but the psychiatrist that like to make money off this horrible disorder that's genetic and proven to be genetic and the only cure that they found was a bone marrow transplant which they will not do for trichotillomania too dangerous. this is why I know it has nothing to do with people that pull their eyelashes or pick their skin or bite their nails it's a totally different disorder because we feel pain inside the brain and that is what's causing us to pick the hair not from anxiety it's just a horrible pain that just comes out of nowhere it could be anytime it's just there's just no quick fix for it and it just the only way to do it is to pick some of the hair out of there and stops it just the pounding stops. again we don't pull any part of the head of a hairs we only pull certain areas that calm the center of the brain to stop pounding. We don't' eat our hair it's very rare case that anyone would want to put that back in their body . I also find that it's odd to have this really thick paste at the root of every hair that we pick out. Maybe someone should look at the hairs at work picking out under a microscope to find out what is this paste find out where it's starting from where it's coming from maybe where our brain is over making this paste and that's all we need is a pill to get it moderated. maybe they can Botox that middle center of the brain so we don't have to feel this pain to cause us to pull the hair. I mean I'm hurting right now I'm hurting so bad and nothing could have done for me . I feel my life is been robbed because of this disorder you have no idea. It's not anxiety or mental disorder .,

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/37395/looking-for-someone-to-share-my-mind-with,Looking for someone to share my mind with,"Hi everyone, Not sure how to begin, but I suppose that is a beginning in and of itself :) I wish I could just invite you all inside my mind - have a look around, and see if I'm someone you want to have anything to do with. It seems a futile effort for anyone to describe who they are and how they feel, but I'll do my best within the limited framework of a forum post. At least the basic facts are easy. I am diagnosed as BPD2 with obsessive compulsive tendencies. I am Male, 40 years old, married, has two boys aged 6 and 11. I have a full-time job as a technical writer, doing work that is generally very easy and repetitive, which seems to go very well with the way my mind works. Every day I take 400 mg of Lamotrigin and 100 mg of Sertralin, which helps to keep me stable, and feeling much better that I did before I started on it more than ten years ago. No dramatic mood swings - neither up nor down. I suffered from quite severe OCD in my pre-teen and teen years. I'm not sure how or when it started, but I know what I was trying to do. I was trying to keep my ""perfect world"" from crumbling. Observing all the misery around the world, I felt that my life couldn't possibly go on being as perfect as it seemed. I could not imagine having a better family, better friends, a better place to live, better health, or a better life altogether. Having no idea how the world works, I somehow thought/hoped I could keep things together by performing all my little rituals. This included saying a long nightly prayer in which I had to mention everyone I wanted to protect, in a very specific order. If I messed up, I had to start all over again. My OCD-controlled life ended when I just couldn't take it any more. I simply gave up on it all from one day to the next. I had reached the conclusion that if God or some other controlling force of the universe could allow random rituals to keep people safe, then it wasn't anything I wanted to be part of. So my OCD was replaced by a sort of apathy that came from the realization that I had no actual influence on anything that really mattered. My family and friends had no idea what had been going on. They thought I was just a bit eccentric, and of course they only saw a little bit of my OCD behavior. From then on I lived in a state of mild depression, or at least unhappiness for no apparent reason, with brief spurts of energy and excitement. It wasn't until much later that it was discovered that I had some kind of mental illness. Actually it happened in connection with me participating in psychiatrist appointments with my wife, who was suffering from borderline schizophrenia and anxiety disorder at the time. It was suggested that I start treatment myself, and one of the first steps was group therapy with a bunch of people who were suffering from various degrees of anxiety and/or depression.  I had a great time in group therapy, and ultimately I was catapulted into a state of immense happiness. I felt like I radiated love to everyone around me. Everything was wonderful, and since unhappiness was the issue when I started, it seemed like I had magically been fixed. My happiness lasted about a week or so after my therapy ended. I desperately tried to hold one to it, but all my efforts were futile. Having experienced true happiness, I felt even sadder afterwards - albeit with a tinge of optimism from the fact that true happiness existed - even if I couldn't find it. I still haven't found the happiness that I experienced that one time, and I have no idea if I ever will again. So, what am I hoping to find here in this forum? I am hoping to find a person that I can share minds with, as much as it is possible to share a mind with someone. I can't promise that I will always have the energy to write a lot, and I would never want writing to become a burden to either of us. Write when you want to, and I will listen, and I will not be silent, but I may not be able to give the long elaborate answer that your writings might deserve. That's it for now. Please write me if you are also looking for someone to share your mind with. Obviously neither of us can really know if our minds are compatible, but I think it is worth a shot.

Anyways, long story short: I suffered multiple traumatic events and mild emotional abuse between the age 4-12, developed depression around 7-8 and received help (therepy and medication) when I finally realized I was depressed at 12, and was diagnosed with PTSD. Thankfully, becoming more independent and removing myself from the abusive situtation has helped me a lot and I can consider myself no longer depressed. Though theres something bothering me. I took part of multiple tests which includued both an IQ test and autisme test/observation. The results showed an IQ of ~130 and mild autistic traits (also known as broad autism phenotype) but not enough for a diagnose. My question is: was I born with these mild autistic traits OR is this the aftermath of being depressed and emotionally abused in my developing years OR just plain PTSD?","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Abuse Victims , Depression"

I have been tapering for 6 months and have .25mg a day left which I take before bed and when I wake up. My symptoms are generally mild compared to other stories but the fear and anxiety is what slows down my tapering speed. I know some of the symptoms are made worse by the anxiety I create on top of the actual symptoms. I know heart rate increased during withdrawal so my question is can I monitor my withdrawal symptoms by checking my rate. For instance if my usual rate is 70bpm normally can I use this as an indicator to know whether or not my body is withdrawing more. So if my heart rate is normal would it be safe to say I am generally ok to continue tapering that day. I just need help to know there is some kind of baseline to distinguish real symptoms from what I create out of my own fear. Thanks.,Anxiety & Panic Disorders

Examples include: asking me a question and starting a conversation with me and then asking the same question again 2 more times by the end of the day, going to the grocery store and not remembering what he needed (my grandma gave him a list, he went to the store, was gone for over an hour, then returned with a pound of deli meat and told my grandma that he lost the list and couldn't remember what he was doing at the store), calling Best Buy (Geek Squad) to fix the computer and then forgetting what company he called to come fix it (he had spoken to Best Buy on the phone about 3 times that day, but couldn't remember who he called), he tried to drive to the Department of Motor Vehicles following verbal directions my grandmother gave him but he forgot where he was going and spent hours driving around before coming home (the next day my grandmother gave him written directions but he lost them and returned home again saying that he couldn't remember where to go - he has been to this DMV before) ...  These behaviors are simply NOT like him. He is usually very sharp and even witty during conversations. My grandfather has not seen a doctor more than twice in the 28 years I've been alive. He hates doctors and tells us that if he ever needs a doctor for anything to just let him die. Due to this fear of doctors, he has not and will not see a doctor for his memory problems. He admits that he is having memory issues, and seems concerned, but will not take steps to figure out the cause.  My grandfather has been an alcoholic since before I was born and is a daily marijuana smoker. I though that maybe these were to blame, but my mom told me yesterday that both of my grandfather's parents exhibited similar symptoms leading up to the day they died.

My biggest problem deals with my oldest daughter and her step-mother (my wife). My daughter is in her mid 30's and is a single mother of 2 girls. My wife and I have been married 13 years now. After I divorced my daughter's mom, I was single for over 10 years and had custody of both of my daughters. My wife feels like my daughter does not respect her-either as a person, step mother, etc. My daughter feels like the comments my wife has made to her has offended her and no longer wants her step-mom in her or the granddaugther's lives. My daughter has told me that my wife is not welcome in her house. My daughter has also told me that the granddaughter's are afraid of my wife based on the comments that my wife has made to my daughter. I can't visit my daughter or granddaughter's because I feel like I will say the wrong thing and upset everyone. I haven't seen my daughter or granddaughter since before Thanksgiving 2017.  I have went to clinical counseling; the only suggestion was for me to get to a point where I can visit my daughter and not feel bad about it. That is not an answer for me. I have asked my daughter several times to sit down with me and her step-mom. We did once--but it turned into a yelling match and made things worse. The other issue I have that I am dealing with is the loss of my dog. We had to put him to sleep. He was over 16 years old; we had him over 10 years (we had adopted him from a rescue group). He was the most loyal dog I have every had. There was a period of time that I was at home while recovering from multiple surgeries. He would sit beside the chair, bed, etc and put his chin on the edge. It was as if he knew I was not doing well and that he was taking care of me in his own way. He had developed several issues the past few months, and the vet had told us that it would take several surgeries and medications and that he still could not guarantee that our dog would get back to ""his old self"". Putting him to sleep was the most difficult thing. I keep seeing him or thinking about him. Every night when I go to bed, I think I have to take him out. It has been about a week since we put him to sleep. I know he is no longer in pain and that our decision was the right one, but it is very difficult at this point whenever I think of him.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression"

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/41791/klonopin-for-yearsss,Klonopin for yearsss,"So, I've been using Klonopin for about 4 years because of how bad my anxiety is. I'm not worried about my anxiety but it's the panic attacks I get MORE THAN 10 times A DAY without Klonopin. So, that's obviously a reason why I'm taking it daily to function or I'll end up in the hospital, not being able to go ANYWHERE, not being able to leave the house, etc etc etc. Anyways, I've always been on 1MG. (Supposed to take it twice a day but I only take it once a day because I feel my body need that exact amount. If I'm having a super bad day then I'll take it twice a day which is SUPER RARE!!!) so, I've been taking it for about 4 years.. I know Klonopin is no way in heck good for your body for a long term use but that's THE ONLY medicine that works and let's me function right. (Trust me I've tried a lot of different kinds before being put on Klonopin) my doctor also recommended Ativan 0.5 for emergencies panic attack that gets out of the control but I trusted myself and told her no thank you, I don't want to ""drug"" myself too much. Now lately, I'm feeling guilty a lot because I really need it to actually function. Am I wrong for feeling guilty? I even tried counseling, challenge my panic attacks, breathe, cope skills, ground techniques, etc and nothing works... someone please tell me in this KIND OF situation, I shouldn't feel bad about myself taking it. :(  Anyways! Lately, I've been having lightheaded. Nothing like ""dizzy"" or anything serious. I'm wondering if it's because my body feel like it's used to the same MG for so long and it's going through ""withdrawals,"" or whatever? I refuse to increase my MG though. I cannot let myself get in deep trouble with Klonopin because if I ever get cut off from it or if I decide I no longer want them, I know how dangerous the withdrawal is.. 1MG is enough for daily in my opinion..",Anxiety & Panic Disorders

It started with extreme itching all over my legs. Later, I am itchy pretty much everywhere. I never had any sign of a rash, or allergic reaction. Sometimes I would wake up in the middle of the night from scratching.( I have no known allergies )  First Steps:  Doctor: I first started by changing the detergent I was using. Then, I went to the doctor who ran blood tests, stool samples, urine tests, and everything came back normal. In the mean time, she suggested I take an anti-histamine for relief and sent me off to get an allergy test. I went to get a full comprehensive allergy test - everything came back normal. However, I hadn't stopped taking the anti-histamine as I was not advised to so I am unsure if it could have been a false test as a result. She then referred me to a dermatologist Dermatologist: I went to the dermatologist, and after describing my symptoms, he did not inspect my skin, but he advised that I do a scabies treatment. (Neither my partner nor I have any signs of scabies and we live together ) I went ahead and did the treatment regardless. Itching persisted. I went back for a follow up, and he suggested that I do it again - out of frustration I asked him, if it wasn't scabies what we would be trying next and he said we would start blood tests etc over. Needless to say I did not go back to him. Doctor: I went back to the doctor to explain my frustrations, and hope for an alternative solution to my problem. She prescribed me steroid creams to try, but it was difficult as the itching was not localized. She advised that this could be something environmental that I never find out - which wasn't something I was willing to accept. This condition has been making me extremely irritable and has begun to affect my professional and personal life. Naturopath: At this point, I've turned to a naturopath. Over the last 6 months, I feel like we have tried almost everything. She reviewed my blood work, and did a new stool sample to rule out parisites. My symptoms now include: itching everywhere, including the bottoms of my feet until they peel and get hot. Itching my legs until they scab. Dry stinging chest, itchy eyes. Painful sweating and itching in areas where there is pressure from clothing ie; waistband, bra straps. Clamy hot skin waist band, bra, underwear lines. More comfortable in loose fitting clothes. Sensitive skin to the point where any fabric ( sheets on my bed included ) touches me, and its almost a painful sensation, prickly burning. This is a list of the following things we have done to try and treat the condition: 1. Mastocytosis Disease - low histamine diet & Stinging Nettle Tea, Quercetin SAP. 2. Low histamine diet, B12 injections, & NAC SAP Antioxidant, Cyto-Calm to help with my sleepless nights. 3. Liver Cleanse - Live SAP & Chelidonium Plex drops 4. Parasite Cleanse - Garlic Activated Principles, Berber, Black Walnut, OIl of Oregano 5. Going off birth control (Nueva Ring) - I was on Yasmine from age 16 - 20, went on Seasonale for about 1 year - went off the pill for 4 months - went back on to yasmine for about 1 year - swtiched to Nueva Ring, on it for approx. 6months) She has given me Femco & Chaste tree to help with the symptoms.  I have been off the Nueva ring for about 1.5 months now. I got my first period normal timing. Since then, my symptoms have increased, and I have scabs all over my shins, now starting to my thighs from itching my skin so hard. Symptoms seem to be worse with clothing on. At work I get hot flash symptoms. I have been consistently waking up at 3am and having trouble falling asleep for the last 3-4 months now. Often wake up in a cold sweat. When I exercise, and sweat my scalp becomes incredibly itchy almost stinging sensation.  My libido is non-existant, and the irritability from itching doesn't help.  If anyone has any insight on something I can try, if you have experienced similar things etc. please help.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression , Self Harm"

Iconfuse words, I have a bad memory, in short: I am the stupidest person to have stepped on the planet. This has prevented me from getting jobs (and no been able to keep uo for the ones that i actually get) has kept me from continuing in college. Above all of this problms, there are these symptoms: The first is a huge sadness that is always there, and every day. Is bad. So I try to see the positive side and always be as positive as posible and I tell myself that is okay and life is beautiful and everything but still feels like a huge pain and pressure in the chest. I have: A lot of appetite or super little and i barely eat anything. I lost interest in everything, I'm tired all the time, i sleep to much or not at all and yet i woke up tired. it's like my brain is rotting. The second thing is that I'm always super nervous, I tremble horrible my system and heary is at 100%, always. Talking to people is super heavy and difficult for me, to the point that it simply interferes with everything. Usually I have hot flushes, I start to over-analyze. I feel that everyone hates me and that I am unbearable. and in general I have like ... Anxiety ??? I am in my house and I am terrified. And that brings me to my next point and it's the panic attacks that usually last between 10-15 minutes but then I feel terrible. It feels fatal, I can not breathe and I try to breathe more and it's as if I could not breathe, the more I try the worse. I start to shake super horrible, I start to sweat, my heart is all over, everything hurts, everything scares me.This brings me to my next point and it is: I feel like I'm not there. When I look in the mirror I do not recognize myself it's like looking at my dad, my body changes. Everything feels like in a dream, the sound, the atmosphere, the shapes and colors everything is distort and become as if i where on a dream, and when I see myself in the mirror it is like looking at me as if someone from outside is watching and I am not even there.The last symptoms: delirium that someone did or planned something bad against my bet. delirium of persecution that someone wants to hurt me or watches over me. and that I think is manifesting differently now and it is: I see scenes, people, things that are not there, simply not. and they are usually aggressive and scary and try to hurt me. Another is like microalucinations that last like a super fast and spontaneous minutes where everything changes suddenly and everything is horrendous. and then I'm back where I was. I listen to voices, as if I were in an auditorium and they are many, evil and heavy and cruel. I see colors that are not there, and flavors. and finally, I always want to commit suicide and or seriously hurt me... and I'm tired.

I’m a 30 year old male that has suffered from a long list of chronic severe symptoms for most of my life. Dozens of specialists consultations and different tests and treatments have yielded no results. Recently, I tried a potassium gluconate supplement. I experienced rapid and dramatic reduction in all of my symptoms. This effect has been repeatable for 2 months. If I stop the supplementation, the symptoms return within a day. Severe, chronic symptoms improved: • Asthma and respiratory issues. • Nasal congestion. • Constipation. • Headaches. • Muscle cramping, weakness and pain. • Insomnia. • Palpitations. I’ve also suffered from unexplained osteoporosis since my twenties. It would be life-changing to finally know what has caused me so much suffering throughout my life. This potassium effect is my first piece of evidence that might help me solve the mystery. I would appreciate any opinions and theories! I’m booked to see an endocrinologist. Suggestions of other recommended specialists are welcome. I’m taking 400mg to 800mg of potassium gluconate per day. I understand that this is within a safe dosage range.

My orthodontist initially recommended Santa Cruz Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, but it turned out they weren’t in my insurance network. I also tried Stanford Medical, but every time I went out there they just referred me to a different doctor, and it’s so far away that every trip costs me a day of work. Then I asked my insurance to give me a list of doctors who could perform the surgery, but I don’t think they understood what I needed, because they ended up giving me a list of orthodontists. The reason I need the surgery is because my bite is off by almost a whole tooth, and my teeth will just get crooked again if I don't fix that.

It localized to the inside of my top and bottom lips and the front/tip of my tongue. No sores or other visible irregulatities, but you can see that the tissue is mildly pink. For the past two weeks the condition has caused my lips and tongue to taste ""salty"". If I'm drinking plain water it tastes salty on the front of my tongue. I went to my dentist who told me that he didn't see anything unusual. He prescribed a steroidal dosepack for one week, which brought some relief but the discomfort and saltiness returned.  I have been to my primary care physician who saw nothing out of the ordinary. He had me take antiviral meds for one week, just in case this was some kind of herpes-related condition. No improvement. My ENT physician thoroughly examined my mouth, throat and sinuses and saw no apparent cause either. He has me using a non-alcohol mouth rinse called ""Closys"". He also has me wearing a ""chin strap"" to keep my mouth closed during sleep. My dermatologist thinks it may be a topical allergic reaction to some medication or supplement I have been taking, but nothing in my diet or health regimen has changed.

I have lived with the condition a little less than 5 years now after a motorcycle accident which at the time, only dislocated my left shoulder.  Now I am a 24 year old male living with a dead left shoulder.  By dead I mean there is no muscle growth or response in my deltoid muscle, as far as I can tell anyway.  I can always feel the outer muscles clearly with discomfort which I have grown to live with (collarbone/trapezius muscles being above, and biceps and under working perfectly.. I think. After the occurrence the doctors here saw to and tried to help my deteriorating condition of rapidly shrinking muscle mass and loss of strength (Once a month for 6 months; Noticeably expressions of ""WTF"" on their faces) they told me just to live with it, for the tissue is now useless (rough translation Thai to English), and I wouldn't mind it so much if I didn't feel ashamed at work wearing a suit and still clearly having one arm 1/4th the size of the other. Strength in the left arm has recovered some but my right arm has grown much larger to counter-weight the lifting and labor I do on a daily basis. Which is what makes my body look weird and even deformed. As for my fitness, I eat well and maintain my ideal body figure for martial arts and try to get checked twice a year. Any advancements in medicine that could be suggested, or even just some way to hide my disability would be very greatly appreciated.

Depakote is a dangerous drug and she can never come off it. And the drugs we tried for diabetes have caused her to have psychotic effects. She is only taking depakote and synthroid.

The last specialist that I went to said that it will go away in about a year or 2. Yet it hasn't gone away it has grown... Today I went to another orthopedic specialist and he recommended me to another mri and x-ray. I got my x-ray done and am waiting for Mri appointment. He said that after he takes a look at the mri he will recommend surgery. It hurts when I sit cross legged and run. Since I am 15 I play a lot of sports and it requires running so the doctor is concerned as well as me. He said the choice is mine if you want to do surgery so I am wondering if I should get it removed or not. It is a constant disturbance when ever I run and is super annoying. I am also wondering how long the recovery time is and what will be the procedures Please tell me what I should do give me your opinions.

Osteoporosis,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/osteoporosis/673/ankle-injury,Ankle injury,"So a few weeks ago I took a pretty bad, hard fall. Twisted my ankle and ended up with a nice scrape on my knee. I thought I had a normal sprained ankle but I didn't. I had a slight limp but could still walk. Unlike normal ones you can't walk on it at all. Well, I looked it up and from what I could find its a high ankle sprain but its still hurts. I can put weight on it but I can't stand on tippy toes without pain or just coming back down quickly. If I put pressure/weight on the inside of my ankle, like if I'm trying to move around in bed, it hurts like a *** on the outside of my ankle and somewhat in the back. I know this may be a waste of time to post but I don't know what exactly is wrong. Is it a muscle, a tendon, I don't know. When I was in high school I had a similar thing happen but it was in the middle of my leg but I was on crutches cause I could not walk on it at all. Even then, I don't know what it actually was. My guess is that my muscle tore or something. That healed within a week or 2. Still had a tiny bit of pain depending but nothing like what I'm having now. I don't know how to keep from making it worse and wrenching it. I know xrays will be a waste of time cause I if anything was broken I'd know, I've been there with my hand, so I guess I don't know what the hell to do.","Living & Managing , Symptoms , Treatment"

I started a new job at the beginning of the year, the job I've wanted to years. But it's completely out of my realm. I'm used to being in the bar industry, whereas now, I'm dealing with 911 calls. So the stress of that is huge! The amount of training along with completely different hours is catching up. Then, it's a pay cut. But in the end, it'll be better, it's a better job in the long run. On top of that, my boyfriend decides that we need a break. Just when I could his support the most. On top of that, my dad went in for lung surgery. Came home then went right back due to an infection which he then needed another surgery. And to top that all off, I'm a single mom to 11 year old triplets. My new work hours has kept me from seeing them as much as I was, so not only am I sad about that, they're sad. Which breaks my heart. So needless to say, my new year hasn't gone smooth.

This affects my ability to absorb vitamins, fats and minerals (I think I read somewhere with a 75cm common channel (the working bit of my small intestine) I will only absorb 25% of everything I orally take). I've lost 11 stone and I'll be on various supplements for the rest of my life including large doses of calcium and vit D. I have to have B12 injections every 3 months (looking forward to my ""fix"" on Tuesday - I always feel like a new person after it!) I have routine DXA scans (every 2 years) and my last one revealed I have been ""upgraded"" from osteopenia to osteoporosis. I can't tell you off the top of my head what my scores were. Last week I broke my toe, accidentally kicking the bed! I have my next DXA scan on Friday. I'm pretty sure it will reveal that the osteoporosis is worse. Since my blood work routinely comes back as bad, regardless of how well or how much of my supplements I take and my broken toe shows it must be worse as it's the first time I've ever broken a bone just stubbing a toe (low impact).  I wondered what the future holds for me at 32 if this keeps getting worse? What will happen to my body? My GP has never explained the long term effects of worsening osteoporosis at my age. Is there anything that can be done? I have been looking at injectables and infusions but my GP (I'm in the UK) has never suggested such things. Are they available over here yet (privately or on the NHS)? Could I ask for them? Could I pay for them? Are they any good? I'm in no pain, have no postural issues, just a tendency to kick stuff and break bones it seems!! :)  Any help would be good. Thanks! Jenn","Bone Density , Living & Managing , Treatment"

I was never treated as the baby of the family so I led a very lonely life even with siblings - to make matters worse my mom lied to me about who my father was until i saw a death certificate of my siblings' father and realised there was an age gap. One of my sisters also told me that i was not her real sister and not in a good way to a 7 year old. When I was 8 years old my mom allowed a step-dad to chase me out of his house while she remained and she asked for me to stay at a friends' house and for a full year I got sexually molested. I later changed living places when my mom separated with that man and found another man in another region far from where I was schooling and once again I had to live with relatives and my mother never brought money or came to visit or clean my washing - I was ill treated because of my mother's irresponsibilities. Another year passed and I had to go live with my mom and the new stepdad and they never took notice of me and I was in a new school new friends new region and still kept the secret to myself - I got molested again at age 11 by one of my brothers' friends but I still went to visit that house just because there was food, tv, goodies to eat which an 11 year old wanted - so once again I kept the secret. At age 17, after 2 primary schools, 1 middle school and 2 high schools later I finished my matric. I had always felt like an outcast all my life and battled with trusting people and relationships and finding myself in society. I learnt that something called depression is what I have and have had that's why I felt always on the down low - low self esteem - self hatred and wanted to be loved. At age 27 I had my 1st born who is now 10. I told my mom about the sexual abuse after the age of 21 but I still did not have a relationship with her - I longed for her affection and never got it - so i did all kihnds of self-destructive behaviors you can think of - in order to ease the depression and i blamed her for how my life turned out - when I asked for an apology I got a ""I said I was sorry"" from my mom. Now im 37 years old - went through 15 years of intense therapy and on the road to healing - I just a huge problem. When I had my son I guess my mom felt bad for her absence during my childhood and she made up for it by giving it to my son. They have a strong bond and I am grateful for that please don't get me wrong - maybe its her way of fixing her mistakes - but I still jealous of my son's love for her. I now have a live in partner, and we both live with my son. We try to make him happy and be the best of parents to the best of our knowledge but whenever we fetch my son after school holidays from my mom's house - he will sulk for a full week saying that he misses my mom. I have shared my life's experience with my son and explained to him what happened to me and taught him about forgiveness but I feel like a coward because I still battle to forgive my mom - whenever she wants to mother my son - I always have these negative feelings - and I don't tell her but my son knows that I get jealous - someone please help me to forgive my mother and enjoy her while she is still alive - I don't want that one day to have past regrets when she is no longer on earth and wish that I had forgiven her - other people don't have moms wish their moms were still alive but im battling with this anger I have towards her only because she never took time to ask me about my abuse and give me a hug and let me tell her everything that happened word for word - when I raise the subjects I can see the shame in her eyes towards herself and she does not think that its not about her its about me - but now I seem think that its no longer about me - I must find a way to forgive her - its now about my son and I don't want my son to think I don't have forgiveness because the circle of life turns and one day it will be me - wanting my son's forgiveness and he will be battling remembering how I used to feel about his granny.

Kinda...,"My life has been a nightmare since I came into this world it seems. I've (more than) struggled with my mental and emotional well being since I was 7. It started off as the (too often) misdiagnosed ADHD. Depression was later on added on to what seems now to be a never ending list of diagnosis'. From there Bipolar 2 was added. And then Anxiety Disorder, which was specified as PTSD at a later date. Lastly, Borderline Personality Disorder was put at the bottom to end the list. The number hospitalizations were overwhelming, the first at when I was just 12. Cutting and attempted suicide were both severe issues. The Medication changes got out of control. The places I was sent to became overwhelming. The worst was Midwest Academy located in Keokuk Iowa for falsely imprisoning ""students"", but other things happened there too. Luckily, I had only been in a cell for months on end and none of the other terrific events had taken place while I was there. (Its all on Google.)  Well, now I am 18. Ive been 'fine' for the most part. But now, I am growing concerned. I used to eat a lot. Of course my weight fluctuated quite a bit throughout my years of being on medication. Currently, I am at 235 lbs and I am only 4'11. Three months ago, I weight 278 lbs.  This wouldnt have brought up any concerns had it not been for how i have been feeling. I still live with my dad. Every single morning, he does his best to make breakfast. But he is 95. Yes NINETY FIVE YEARS OLD. He still drives, ect. Gets around wonderfully. So, he doesnt always feel the best which is understandable. Ive been extremely stressed though. I was in Job Corps not too long ago and I didnt eat breakfast or dinner because during the times that they were served, I just wasnt hungry. If I eat and im not hungry, I will get really sick and sometimes (but not all) I will throw it back up. I only ate lunch and I binge ate during that time. But recently, before I came home for good, i noticed that i just wasnt hungry anymore. It was as if I just couldnt eat. I strongly believe that if I wasnt supposed to take medicine after lunch and needed food to take it with, I wouldnt have eaten lunch at all. Now that i am at home, I dont want to eat even though I do. Its almost like if i have to prepare it, i wont eat. And if its apart of foods im just sick of, i wont eat it either. Chicken, noodles (pasta in general), stew, soup, hamburgers, french fries, bread, sweets, meat, cereals, juices, fish, the list goes on. I just dont want to eat. I feel like it may be more psychological than anything but I dont know what it is. At one time, i was diagnosed with a binge eating disorder, but now, im highly confused. Is it stress or whats going on with me?","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression , Eating Disorders , Self Harm , Bipolar Disorder , Personality Disorders"
Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/33349/superiority-complex,superiority complex,"i have a friend who i think has a mild superiority complex. i think she feels like everybody around her is an idiot. she has maybe two or three people who she considers intelligent, even though shes met thousands of academics. im hoping after reading the next few paragraphs, anybody with similar issues might be able to educate me further on how to help her. she always suggests that there is no problem with genocide within societies, if it is executed on behalf of the majority of the population committing the crime because it is simply ""politicians doing what they are meant to do, representing the majority of their society"". She insists that this is only morally wrong to me because of my personal beliefs and upbringing, and that if i were raised in another country, my morals may be completely different. (she doesn't believe in a global morality)  She believes that listening to minorities is unproductive and counteractive to being efficient if they go against 'what the general population wants' she suggests being homosexual is wrong because the sole purpose of any organism on earth is to naturally reproduce to ensure survival of their species. she has said that we shouldn't have to apologize to natives who's land we stole because we didn't steal it. we did what humans have been doing since the beginning of time, waging a war, winning the war, taking the land, slaughtering the natives and ensuring our bloodline survives over others. her argument wasn't that its okay to do this, just that we shouldn't have to apologize through public holidays and days of 'reconciliation' because it wasn't us... it was someone 100 years ago that we never met. She also believes that the natives shouldn't be treated any differently then the invaders because ""it happened, no mount of welfare is going to fix it. it doesn't excuse poor current situational choices"". These are just some examples of the crazy things she says and i thought ""maybe shes psychotic?"" but she uses facts? she always gives me thousands of academic references from multiple sources, and she says that these statements are just logic, they aren't representative of her personal opinions. Its strange because ive known her for years and she is super empathetic. i once watched her use all her train money to buy a homeless man a meal and she walked home in the hottest heat all summer. when i asked about it she said ""evidence suggests that if i ask a stranger for train money, i am more then twice as likely to get it then if a homeless person does, based on my appearance in general."" she stated that she however didnt like asking for money because you shouldnt ask for it unless you really need it. she also said that its unfortunate that alot of these homeless prefer to be homeless because it means they can continue doing the drugs and behavior that got them there in the first place. she insists that there is plenty of help and shelter to those who want a 'clean lifestyle' this is an example of the backwards thinking that plagues one of the generally most empathetic people i know. So im thinking she maybe has a superiority complex. i have known her 10+ years and she has risked her life for both animals and people alike many times (through her job). she always listens to my problems, no matter how small or stupid they end up being and she always helps me with my problems mentally and physically. She has a lot of LGBTQI+ friends and never treats them differently to her other friends and she is insanely honest and open except when it comes to her views. she knows her views aren't popular so it takes me a lot of prodding to get them from her. after these examples, im hoping someone has an answer as to whats wrong with her. why does she think so backwards? does anybody else have experience with this sort of behaviour? is she a narcissist? is she psychotic? or does she have a superiority complex?","Schizophrenia , Bipolar Disorder , Personality Disorders"

Sleep,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sleep/79898/sexsomnia-is-this-a-real-thing,Sexsomnia! Is this a real thing?,"So not sure where to post something like this, but here goes. My wife and I have been married for 10 years and in the last week or so her behavior and sleeping patterns have changed. I woke up one night to the sounds of her masturbating in bed next to me. I didn’t really think much about it besides being super excited that something like that was happening. We have talked about masturbation but she either was never open about talking about it or was telling the truth that she doesn’t really do it. I always encouraged her to do it but she always just said she wasn’t into it. Back to the story at hand. So the first night I woke up to her masturbating, and all seemed pretty normal. She did her business and went to bed. Then the next night she did it again, and again did her business and was done. The last 5 nights or so, the frequency has really picked up. She has done it every night with it getting more and more vigorous (for lack of a better word) as each night has progressed. It has gone from just doing it once before she goes to bed to her now doing it 5 and 6 times a night. It seems to happen every time she suddenly wakes up. The last two nights especially I have not slept because of it. It seems to be happening at least every hour, if not more. I have read a little about sexsomnia in the past few days and have also read others stories. To try and keep a super long story short, is this something that could be a possibility? I only ask because in 10 years of marriage, this has never happened before. It seems to have come out of no where. I haven’t brought it up because honestly if it isn’t that and she enjoys doing it, who am I to say she shouldn’t. It is just tough because I haven’t been sleeping partly just due to the excitement that this is really happening. Part of me thinks it could be something where she is finally open to doing that but it has just been so sudden, and when she does do it, she really gets into it, and normally she is pretty reserved about things like that. I think it also could be about her possibly being attracted to someone else, considering each night she does start it willingly before she goes to bed. That in itself is also something I have never noticed until now. She just wouldn’t normally do that willingly in the bed right next to me. Lately I have been going to bed before her because I wake up a lot earlier then she does, whereas it used to be her always going to bed first. When she has started before she goes to sleep, it tends to just be light playing, she orgasms then goes to bed. In the middle of the night is when it gets crazy. The last few nights she has been moaning more when she sleeps, plus the masturbation has gotten to a whole new level. She thrusts her hips up, inserts larger things (usually pretty firmly), fondles herself all over and genuinely goes pretty crazy. It just seems odd But based on the fact that she does start it before bed, she could just really wanting To get off that badly, whether it is someone else or just her now being comfortable with it. Not sure what to think really. She doesn’t want sex all that often and all of a sudden out of nowhere she is going crazy pleasuring herself. But if it is her just enjoying this new found self love, she is hardly being discreet about it. I guess that is what makes it so odd. Anyway not sure what else to put but some feedback is always appreciated.",

Complete lack of desire to pursue any type of new relationship.  3. I have no desire to really see/meet people I don't already know. 4. I've become socially awkward when I do meet new people. 5. I've been experiencing intruding thoughts of me doing/saying crazy things, or past memories of me doing embarrassing things. I have to scrunch eyes or clench fists to make them go away.  For the record, I have ADD and have been taking Concerta 72mg for the last year and a half. About a month ago, I ran out of my dosage and had to resort to using 10mg tablets of Ritalin (these were prescribed by my doctor but I never actually used them). I started by chewing one tablet a day but moved up to two because I could not focus. Concerta has worked well for me since I started in late 2016.  Is this something I should be worried about? Or is it part of puberty? I am a 17 year old male.",

Please help !,"Hello I am a F 26YO. I have suffered from severe lack of breath for about 13months now. It started when I was pregnant and I am not 6m post partum and still struggling.  I have severe shortness of breath and irregular breathing for about 80% (sometimes more, sometimes less) of my waking day. Sometimes I breath in so deep and so hard that my ears pop and unpop, and I can continue in that state for an hour or more trying to regulate my breathing and unpop my ears permanently. Sometimes my breathing is so messed a whole hand or side of my body will go numb like I’m having a stroke. Sometimes my chest gets very tight and I feel I really won’t be able to catch my breath. I often think I’m going to pass out or choke but I never do. When I was pregnant the lack of breathing manifested itself in a dry cough which I had for 6months straight which was literally just a cough from lack of breath.  It affects my life as I can be rude or snappy to people when I’m trying to regulate my breathing, and I’m often not present in what’s going on. Plus all the hard deep breathing is causing pain in my back. I have been to three different doctors and all of them have diagnosed anxiety (something I have struggled with in different forms for 11years). They think it’s this because i seem to be fine when I sleep and for the first 10 minutes when I wake from sleeping, and if I am very preoccupied (in some situations). I have been diagnosed escitocitalopram 20mg for the anxiety. I’ve been on it for around 10 months (or longer) with no success. In my country you only qualify for free/subsidised non-medical counselling help if you are depressed and on the verge of suicide. Other than my days being hard work because I can’t breathe I have a happy life and am not depressed hence why I cannot get counselling. In my country doctors are extremely overworked and I’m concerned they have overlooked something hence why after 13 months I am still struggling. I can’t do another year of this, please help !","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression"

First, I don’t think I have slept more than 6 hours since I was in my 20’s (I am 59) and I was always an early riser (around 530-6 am). I guess my first occurrence of insomnia first started about 13 years ago where I couldn’t get to sleep because my brain wouldn’t shut up. My family physician put me on a low dose of Xanax and that seemed to do the trick. About 2-3 years ago my insomnia changed from not being able to get to sleep to not being able to sleep through the night (generally I have no problem getting to sleep). Initially I would get about five hours to now where I am lucky to get four hours of solid sleep. What I find unusual is that most nights it is four hours and then I just wake up, no feeling that something woke me up. I can’t remember the last time I had a dream. I have read many articles, youtube, etc about what to do to stay asleep and I have been doing them all for months with no success. I am currently on 2 mg lorazepam (family dr) and I have tried some herbal remedies (valerian, melatonin, and a milk mixture with four different spices) with no success. I even saw a sleep medicine doctor at a prestigious university medical center about two hours from my home which in my opinion turned out to be a waste of time since the doctor just entered everything I had written down into the computer – the entire visit was less than 30 minutes! The doctor’s (or maybe the computer’s) recommendation was to do CBTI however I live in an area where there isn’t anyone with any level of expertise with CBTI. I have checked out some of the online CBTI apps and will probably try one of them but I am hoping someone out there knows of something to try. Thank you in advance for any recommendations.",Insomnia

Your inability to love anyone but yourself, coupled with your lack of empathy makes you a monster. You are not better than any other person on this planet. You do no accept responsibility for your actions. Your choices have consequences; no else is to blame.  You hold grudges and start arguments for no rational reason.

This is going to be a long post, so sorry for that.  He’s 68 years old and for several years now he has had weird sleep patterns. Due to his job, he worked night and day, so that probably messed him up. On top of that, he was very attached to his job and lost it when he was 63, he got depressed and never accepted help. He spent nights on his computer playing video games. He got over his depression when he retired and got his pension (he was worried about his financial situation after retiring, and once he did he felt very relieved), but he still spends his entire life on his computer. Even when he watches a movie on TV he sits behind his screen. Anyway, on top of all the issues he clearly has, he has this disorder (irregular sleep wake rhythm  ) , he may go to bed at 9am, wake up at 2pm and have lunch, go back to sleep at 6pm and take a nap... he falls asleep on the couch during the daycare, etc. He can spend days at home without going out. I’m worried about him but I’m more concerned about my mom, as this affects her life as you can imagine and my dad acts like a selfish person. She no longer makes plans with him and refuses to go on vacation with him because he spends the day sleeping. I have given him tons of advice, but he hates it. He’s by far the most stubborn person I know. Last weekend I was at their place with my husband and our baby and barely saw him. One evening we went out for dinner and he didn’t come because he was sleeping. As you see, this interferes with his entire life.  Today I sent him the article I pasted above (  ) and told him I think he has this disorder. He admitted he knows he has a problem. Now I wonder how to help, and what he should do. He’s very skeptical regarding doctors and I doubt I can convince him to go to one. Do you have any advice on what he could do? Is anyone familiar with this problem? I told him he should have a schedule of daily tasks and stop using screens in the evening. He said he’s going to take melatonin too. This is hard because he’s a pessimistic, stubborn old man.

It has now come to a point where my son is at home after his studies. He can't sleep since his room is next to our room. Both our children have chronic fatigue syndrome so need a night of nondisturbing noise. The solution my son found was to search for a CPAP equipment and supplies (   ) in our locality and buy a mask that quite the snoring sound. It stops the snoring sound.  I told my husband that he needs to see a doctor. But he blankly refuses to see a doctor. So I think this will be really helpful. Do anyone use this equipment before, If so, please share the feed backs. I need one very soon.",

My wife complained that I used to snore in the midnight with very loud noise and I used to wake up in the midnight. I went to my family doctor who suggested undergoing Nocturnal polysomnography. I was not knowing what it was. As per doctor's proposal, I have undergone the test in which I was hooked up to equipment that monitors your heart, lung and brain activity, breathing patterns, arm and leg movements, and blood oxygen levels while you sleep. After the evaluation doctor said that I am suffering from sleep apnea. I am planning to undergo treatment for that. My doctor suggested Continuous positive airway pressure but I am afraid of the mask as it reminds me of the ICU memory I had two years back. So when I asked my doctor he suggested about sleep apnea treatment from a clinic Aurora (   ). It is a dental clinic. I think that they will be giving some mouth guards which may help me out.

After this I would start to notice my heart beat increasing in speed, eventually pounding very fast and loudly. It would continue to do this for at least 2 minutes. During this time I would feel very sick, and the first time it happened I actually experienced diarrhoea. After these attacks my body feels tingly and shaky. I have been experiencing tinnitus for the past year, which has been steadily getting worse. I have depression and am taking Lovan, but have never had this kind of attack happen during the day.

I went to high school like every other child i did pass but i have 4 subjects i am a slow learner.

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/37059/something-s-off-about-me-but-i-don-t-know-what,"Something's off about me, but I don't know what.","Something's not right about me. I'm concerned I have some kind of mental illness. At first I thought it was depression, but I dont feel depressed and it keeps getting worse. Please understand that I'm aware I can't get a diagnosis here, and I am seeing a doctor soon, I just can't right this second. I want some opinions because I want to know what to be ready for. I am currently 18 years old and living with my grandfather. My most notable probelms are as follows: -I'm barely emotional. I hardly cry or get angry. I'm told I'm dull or selfish (because I don't have a lot of empathy, which caused difficulties between my mom and I. I understand other people's feelings, I just oftentimes don't have the drive to care as much as I should. Apathy.) often and I have a hard time showing or accepting intense emotion. I can get my feelings hurt relatively easily, though. - Easily bored, few activities, low motivation. I spend all of my days in bed. Sometimes I might play video games, but I don't stay invested long. I don't really do anything because I just don't really feel like it. I stopped trying in or caring about school my freshman year of high school. I used to be a straight A student. I've even lost motivation to keep clean. I used to clean myself excessively, now it's always an afterthought and I have a very difficult time caring or motivating myself to do it. Sometimes I have problems with instructions, especially if it's a set of them. (Ex. My grandpa was cleaning the oven and told me it smelled really weird. He told me to open the door and check (meaning the oven door). I went to the front door of the house and opened it, maybe thinking he was telling me to get a breath of fresh air and then see how the house smells different. I understood when he corrected me and elaborated. This happens frequently and causes me to get overwhelmed when the directions are long or complex.) - Isolation and withdrawal. I no longer have any friends because of my stubbornness and apathy and also because I lost interest in socializing. I haven't talked to anyone outside of my family (not including my girlfriend, long distance) or left the house in months. If my grandpa's home, I don't leave my room except to eat and use the restroom. I have a very low sex drive and often no sex drive at all. Sometimes I lose the energy and motivation to speak, so I don't. I'm known for being quiet. - Talking to myself? I've had a difficult time assessing whether this is an actual symptom of an illness, or just a sort of myth. I talk to myself often as if I'm talking to someone else. I may refer to myself by my name and as 'you' out loud, or often the same way in my head. When I think sometimes the thoughts feel very loud or 'intense', sometimes almost to the point where it feels real enough that I'll kind of move my tongue along with it. I feel like I'm reading a lot into that one, though. I'll also talk to myself by sometimes repeating how a conversation went or 'practicing' for one I haven't had yet, either out loud or in my head. - Paranoid thoughts and existential anxiety. These are the symptoms that have caused me considerable distress and are the most recent to appear, along with being the reason for my suspicions to begin with. The paranoia started about six or seven months ago after I tried LSD once (I was a drug user for a while, this is what made me cut down/eventually stop). A few days after the trip, I started having mild depression (which is better now). Then I started having really intense and overwhelming unprovoked fears of being murdered. This got so difficult to deal with that it became a ritual to find and secure every possible entry point to the house, I would always carry a knife around and put one under my pillow at night, and I oftentimes couldn't sleep or relax. I once saw three young boys outside my house and was convinced they were scoping me out to rob me. I would also regularly worry that my grandpa had placed audio devices or cameras in the house before he left for work, or that he only pretended to leave for work to trick me and was secretly in the house still watching me, both because he thought I was doing something bad. Those thoughts weren't as intense and I was able to reassure myself. I would also become extremely concerned that the police were after me, or that neighbors knew I had done drugs and were watching me or preparing to contact the police. Anytime I saw a police car or heard sirens, I would be completely silent and wait in my room in the dark watching through the windows to see if they were coming for me. I'm so on edge sometimes that I may accidentally mistake other sounds for sirens. For example, a rooster call a few days ago. If a car was parked even several houses away from me with the headlights on, I would worry they knew and were watching me, waiting for me to do something illegal so they could call the police. I also at one time expressed concern to my girlfriend that my neighbors were watching me through my window because I saw one drive by twice in a short span of time. Anytime I have my window open and someone exits their house, I think they're watching me. I had a dispute with my mom throught text online once, and for a while I was very worried she would come over to my grandpa's house with her boyfriend to kill or kidnap me. I still have these episodes and I didn't even notice they were strange until my girlfriend mentioned it. They seem a little silly in hindsight, but they always feel real in my mind while it occurs. Also, the symptom that led to me noticing something was wrong, existential thoughts and thoughts about death and life's meaning are always on my mind and almost intrusive. This became gradually more severe until recently I had a bad panic attack because I don't understand what consciousness means or where it comes from, where it goes, or how it can logically exist. I just get so hyper self-aware that it's almost debilitating. This terrifies me to think about and I often try to keep myself preoccupied to avoid these thoughts. Though, even if I'm not panicking, they're always there. - Possible dissociation? This started occurring after my existential panic. I now go through phases where I feel like I'm dreaming or I don't exist, I don't do a lot or move much because I feel light and like I'm not taking up any space, almost ghostly. My emotions feel distant and I feel empty, unable to relate to anyone or anything.  Those are the ones that have been the most concerning for me and those close to me. Does this sound like the onset of any kind of illness? It started about three years ago with my increased isolation and has gradually gotten worse. Thank you in advance for any help you can offer.",

Really, the only reason I'm sticking around is for my parents. I'm a mess. I'm unhappy. I'm sad. I feel nothing. So I do that to feel anything at all. It's a relief and makes everything better for a few minutes then I'm left with blood everywhere. I'm on 10 medications and am going to therapy/counseling. Nothing helps. I want to die, but I'm scared to leave.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression , Schizophrenia , Self Harm , Substance Abuse , Bipolar Disorder , Personality Disorders"

My daughter got married December 30 and I played a huge part in the planning and actual leg work of this wedding. I did way more than most mothers of the bride due to the many people that normally help having sicknesses and living out of town. For about three months I was extremely busy - And by the end pushing exhaustion. My family noticed that I did better During that time. I was even surprised at MYSELF especially considering that during that same time My son was put on a mixture of pain and other meds and he was threatening his life PLUS my mother-in-law became very ill and I was trying to help as much as I could With her. I can’t remember when I’ve been so tired and stressed but I got through it. I also suffer from chronic pain And I am on disability due to the Mental plus health issues from 2 failed neck surgeries so I had pushed myself to the limit with that as well. The last six weeks it was almost non stop. She’s not able to drive due to epilepsy so I had to drive anytime anything was needed. The day after the wedding I crashed slightly I wasn't majorly depressed though - I was trying to help with my mother-in-law more but I had a setback because my husband got very ugly with me because I kept asking him to make a schedule between his two sisters and brother about the care of his mother and father. I was willing to take two days a week myself – but evidently asked one too many times and he got really mad And was very ugly to me about it. I started getting worse after that. I guess that was the straw that broke the camels back for me. I felt very taken for granted and quite hurt considering it’s my in-laws but I was still very much willing to help out. My husband can’t understand HOW I did so well during all the craziness and then afterwards I crashed. It seems as if he now feels that I can control The depression. I’m sorry for the long backstory but I felt it was important in order to get the answer that I need – my question is this – is what happened to me something that happens with a lot of people that suffer from depression? I am feeling incredibly guilty which is not abnormal but even more so now. I honestly don’t know how I was able to push myself through all that - But I did not completely crash until my husband completely lost his temper with me for trying to help. Up untill then I was helping a good bit. I feel like I should say that he’s A good person he works very hard at a full-time job and also is part time choir director at our church. He just doesn’t understand. He has done some reading on depression over the years but seems to understand it more with other people than he does with me. So please, I need to know if anyone else has gone through what I have? It’s hard to understand how someone can do better during times of extreme stress whether it be good or bad and then get worse when it’s all over. I’d appreciate any answers Thank you so much!",Depression

Sleep,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sleep/50686/woke-up-but-still-aware-of-dream,Woke up but still aware of dream,"I've been wondering for years about this. I had a dream when I was about 9 years old and it was so scary and real I could never forget. I was in a room and there were creatures around yelling and laughing gibberish stuff. Then there was a man with a really big head yelling as loud as he could at me. It was all gibberish so nothing he said was real words but I knew what he was telling me somehow.  He was telling me to touch a block with my hand and then touch another one on the other side of the room without letting go of the first one. I couldn't do that because they were too far apart so I was getting afraid When he started yelling louder. When I woke up(i was really awake entirely, not still dreaming) the unbearably loud noise that was happening and the amount of color and the creatures and man were still there. I could hear everything from the dream and no other noise from the world around me because it was so loud(even when my mom was trying to talk to me). When I opened my eyes, I looked at the walls and I could still see everything in the dream perfectly. When I closed my eyes it was still there. It would not go away so I was even more agitated. I went to my parents (I walked down the hall and none of the sounds or visuals stopped) and climbed into their bed, cried and screamed until eventually I passed out because I was so tired. I woke up the next morning feeling okay but every once in a while for YEARS NOW, if I hear a noise(anything, even an air conditioner going off one time) I can suddenly hear the man yelling and it's still so vivid and really loud at times. I haven't had the problem of triggering the noise in about 2 years now but I was just wondering why this all happened because it was the scariest time of my life and I was only maybe 8 or 9 so it sort of? traumatised me. If any one has any answers, please let me know. Thank you to anyone who was patient enough to read my rant even if you can't help me.",Nightmares

Sleep,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sleep/51731/do-these-hallucinations-link-to-a-sleeping-disorder,Do these hallucinations link to a sleeping disorder?,"Heya! So I've decided to come here because I'm seriously getting fed up with this.  It's basically this: When I'm sleeping with someone else in the room (my boyfriend, one of my friends, brother etc) before I fall asleep or just after I wake up, I tend to respond to them though no one's said anything! NOTE: This happens ONLY when I fall asleep or wake up near other people. I can genuinely clearly remember hearing and seeing things, they seem like hallucinations. On bad days this can happen like 5 times in a row. It's not like I'm dreaming, I am aware that I am awake, and that's what makes this so strange to me. -------- For example: My boyfriend and I were watching the Pokemon movie with Entei. I clearly remember a bunch of Chikorita happily jumping up against a fence. So I said ""awww, look at those cute Chikorita!"" and my boyfriend was like ""... But there's no Chikorita"". So I looked at the screen and it showed some Pokemon in the snow.  Another example is when my friend stayed over a couple of days ago. I responded to her SO many times though she never said anything. And I clearly remember I had to tell myself ""Nope, don't respond yet... Just look at her first"" so I looked over and she was fast asleep.  And yet another example I clearly remember. I remember my boyfriend asked me to watch something on Netflix with me. He was looking towards me laying on his side. I said ""Nah, don't really feel like it"" and my boyfriend was like ""... Huh?"" so I looked over and he was lying down playing his 3DS with his back towards me. It's honestly annoying to keep apologizing because it's one of those times again. I've tried looking it up on Google but I can't seem to find anything. It's getting extremely annoying and I wonder if anyone knew what it was. I've also had very shaky hands lately which is apparently linked to Parkinsons, but it doesn't seem very common in 20 year old females.  Thank you in advance.",

I noticed that, while I would wake up several times in the night, I only ever achieved light sleep, which according to the app was 2nd and 3rd stage. Never once did I have any deep sleep. Now, this app could be inaccurate, but I’m taking the chance that it is accurate, and in that case this lack of deep sleep could be the source of many of my sleep problems over the years.

I have 2 alarm clocks that go off every 5 minutes for exactly 2hrs (That's if I dismiss all of my alarms but since I'm not because I'm sleeping through them, they go on for longer). Everyone in my house hears the alarm and knows when it goes off. Also, my stepdad comes into my room every morning to hug me and tells me goodbye. Seems like over-kill, right? Yet, ever since the problem started 2 weeks ago, I seriously cannot wake up. Now in the morning, I don't hear any of my alarms, nor do I even remember my stepdad coming into my room and waking me up.

My roommates over the past 10 years try to help by yelling for me to get up but it never works, and I usually just fall asleep again. I am tired of having to rely on other people to wake me up because they usually get really mad at me and think that I am just staying up late on my phone all night, but even when I try to explain that I am not, they don't understand that alarms don't work. This has ruined a lot of friendships for me. I want to live on my own, but I kinda know I can't because I will never be able to wake myself up. Once at a overnight thing I told someone to call me in the morning to make sure I woke up, and I never woke up on time. I looked at my missed calls and it turns out they called me over 20 times, no exaggeration. If anyone knows of any other way to wake up, I really would like to know because everyone else's standard of alarms don't work for me whatsoever.

Now, energy drinks do not work well. I wake up at night and have natural energy no matter how sleepy I was during the day. Even the days I do not drink energy drinks to stay awake during the day. When I get sleepy, I can feel something inside my head but not sure what it is.  I end up taking adderral to keep me awake but it only worked sometimes. Adderall makes me pass out and extremely hungry most of the time.  Now for me to function normally, I have to combine adderall with Redbull.  I took two months break from going to school and stayed with my parents to reset my system from all the caffeine and Adderral. I was asleep most of those two months at my house. No stress at all. I also end up sweating under my armpits no matter what I'm doing or even with antiperspirant deodorant.  I cannot workout anymore because I'm sleepy inside my head.

Also, if you have a history of substance abuse, you might want to look into suboxone. I used to be a heavy opiate user until I found this drug, and it saved my life. Just find the right doctor and the sky is the limit. I went from a socially deprived heroin user who overdosed to a relatively normal person because of these two drugs. I also Take ADDERALL XR for ADHD but that's another story. Good luck to everyone out there with problems like me.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression , Substance Abuse"
Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/34857/do-i-have-depression,Do I have depression?,"Almost everyday when I wake up I feel kind of empty. I feel like a failure and I play over and over all the things that I failled at. All the conversations that I had where I should have said something diferent. And so I feel even worse. I think about killing myself. In fact a couple of months ago I started doing self harm. I dont know why I did it that day. I wasnt even that sad... I was just tired of feeling numb so I cut my arm one time. And it felt good. So I started cutting everyday. Then a couple of weeks ago my parents found out and they told me only crazy people did that and that they were very disapointed with me. So I stopped cutting my arm and starded cutting my legs. I take a lot of time to fall asleep and I sleep for like 10 hours. I shouldnt feel this way. Im only 18. I finished school last year and decided to take a year off. I am learning how to drive so I should be happy. When I was a kid I was bullied by my best friends. It went on for years and the worst is I didnt realized it. I thought it was normal. Then when it got phisical my parents found out and moved me to another school. I made new friend and they were really good to me. Thatt when I realized that what happend was wrong. I felt so stupid! And so angry with them for mocking me and hurting me, with my parents for not noticing and with me for letting it happen. I felt so lost. I took half a year of school and moved to my grandparents home. I barely left the bed. My family wanted to take to a psychologist but I didnt wanted to talk about it. I just wanted to forget it. So I did. I pulled myself up. I started going to school again and I managed to pass the year. Then a few years later, two years ago my mom found out she had cancer. It was a very difficult time. She has severe depression and then she got really worse. She wanted to die. We were praying for it to be benign and she was praying for it to be malignant. A few months later we got the news. It was benign. She was going to be fine. Today she still has severe depression but she starded seeig a psychiatrist and taking medication so she is a lot better. So back to me. I dont really understand why I feel the way I feel. I mean. why now? Now everything is fine. Im just starting my life. Im thinking about going to college next year. Or at least I think I am. There are day when I feel fine. Happy even. On this days I think about my future and I see one. I will go to college. The get a job. A house. And I'll live. But then I realize that those are just dreams. That in reality I will never be able to do it. I will fail. And so I even want that life? I dont! I dont want to go to college! I dont have the energy to... Whats the point in having a job and a house if you dont want to live? Whats the point in living a long life if its going to be a miserable one? Whats the point?  Today when I woke up I was feeling fine. I was doubting myself... ""maybe I dont have depression... I mean I feel fine now"". When I started this post I wanted someone to tell that it was all in my head because maybe it is... Maybe Im just sad and this is normal? I mean... Im not sad all the time. For example yesterday was a good day. I talked with my friends and we made plans for new years eve and I felt happy. I smiled and laughed... So Im fine. Right? I dont want to see someone or talk about stuff... I just want to be ok. Am I okay? I am right? This is just a fase right? As long as I dont actually kill myself its okay to cut right? I dont know... Sometimes Im fine then I get really anxious and then I start panicking... and there are lots of other stuff that happend to me that I dont really talk about... and I m sorry if this is confusing and bad written.... I guess I just want someone to give some anwsers and tell me Im fine...","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression , Self Harm"

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/34467/anxiety-and-mood-swings-question,Anxiety and mood swings question,"First of all, I'm not sure this is the right category for this question but anyway...  Just to let you know something about myself: I'm 24 years old, I work as a computer programmer and I tend to overwork myself A LOT. Needless to say, I don't do much sports but I am not overweight. Had problems with candida (back in 2015) which caused similiar simpthoms as described below but not that strong. So, to the problem at hand... One year ago (last November) I started experiencing more and more anxiety each day (I am prone to anxiety but not to this extent). Shortly after, panic attacks started happening out of nowhere. I noticed that the panic attacks tend to happen when I stay in front of the computer for a longer period of time, but they were not limited to just this. When I enter this ""panic state"" all my senses feel overwhelmed and fast moving objects in front of my eyes cause irritation in my nerve system (I feel something like a surge or an impulse of some sort). It seems like everything originates from my Vagus nerve. This happened almost every day and it was very unpleasant... In time I kinda got used to it and managed to keep it less intense with will power I guess. Still pretty unpleasant. Anyway... When summer came, I had a problem with some weird cough that occurred very randomly throughout the day. I would cough in the mornings or in the evenings, but sometimes in the middle of the day too. It was intense for like 5-10 minutes and then it would fade away. It was caused by saliva or something behind my nose I guess, that went down the throat and caused the cough. I ignored it for quite a while but then decided to go to the doctor and she thought it was an allergy (I usually have allergies in the spring when certain trees blossom). She gave me a shot of some medicine, not sure what, that was supposed to deal with that ""allergy"". Needless to say, it did not help. Actually, it became far worse after the shot. I went to a lab in my town and gave samples of saliva from my throat. In the results it turned out to be a massive candida infection. It was probably a candida infection to begin with but it grew even more after that shot (I think it suppresses the immune system to battle allergies?). I was anxious and panicked ALL THE TIME at that point. When I gave the results to the doctor and she prescribed medicine to battle the candida (Itroconazole) things got much better. I stopped eating sweet things and limited my sugar intake as much as possible, as I read that candida thrives on sweet things. I started feeling great for a time. No coughing, anxiety/panic level was minimal with panic states happening rarely (but still there). Something very strange I noticed was, whenever I would eat chocolate or something sweet or consume milk, I would enter panic states after a couple of hours of consumption. I gave more samples to the lab after a while, to see if the candida has been dealt with... and it was. However, this time a significant amount of ""Haemophilus parainfluenzae"" was isolated from the samples. I went to the doctor again, she prescribed antibiotics. After 7 days of taking them everything was gone. No anxiety, no panic attacks. Nothing. It was great! However, a month and a half later I began to gradually experience more and more anxiety and the panic states returned shortly after that. I went to the lab yet again... Small amount of candida and again, a significant amount of haemophilus parainfluenzae. I started taking antibiotics again... after 7 days of them and another 5 so my organism can clear them off a bit, I gave more samples to the lab. No candida, significant amount of haemophiuls influenzae (without the ""para"" this time). Went to my doctor again, she said that was good for some reason. Gave me another antibiotic (weaker I think) and told me to take it for 10 days. And I finished it a couple of days ago. I will soon go to the lab again and see what happens... So, what do you guys think? Is this anxiety/nervousness/panic state caused by candida, by bacterial infection, by overworking and staying on the computer too long? Is it just a mental problem? Is it a combination of all these things? I really want to return to my normal state before all that.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression"

Not only do these people take them, but the majority take them at a low dose without abusing them like Debbie is so concerned about. If you don't believe me, look it up. I also speak from personal experience. I've taken benzos for years without problems. However, I'll concede that they could easily be abused if you think like Debbie. Many people do abuse them, which makes people like me look bad. I do not condone recreational use. They are to be taken as prescribed.

I’ve done multiple EKG’s in the past, with most of them reading “normal”. But a couple of them read LVH. I’ve done a little research, and what I gained was that LVH is basically a enlarged valve. I followed up and did a ultrasound of my heart, and everything came back as normal. A couple things worry me though. 1- my blood pressure sometimes spikes to 140/73. I know the bottom number is good, but the top number is not. However I am always extremely nervous when I take my blood pressure. 2- I am ALWAYS aware of my heartbeat it seems like, and I’m constantly checking my pulse. It’s the worse when I lay down on my bike. I had a major panic attack back in feb 2017, where I felt like I was dying and I couldn’t catch my breath. I think it’s important to point out that I was taking adderall (prescribed not recreational) 20G extended release during this time. And I was convinced to smoke some weed (I know, stupid) and that’s when the panic attack happened. It was horrible, and I’ve had major anxiety ever since. I had no chest pain during this attack, however my pulse was through the roof, my limbs and face were tingling and I couldn’t breathe. I did not pass out though. What I want to know is this. How can I treat this? I have not taken any adderall since that day, barely drank any alcohol, and I’m never touching weed again. But I need some help, it still feels like I have some underlying heart issue. By the way, I am a 24 year old male in great shape. Work out almost everyday.

I try to be a good person these days, but a few years ago I did not care. I used heroin almost daily just to get by. One day, I did an extra large shot and it killed me. Yes, that's right. I flatlined and had to be resuscitated with narcan. This woke me up, and I realized I had a problem. After I got out of rehab, I went to a psychiatrist. I told him my history and my main reason for using: anxiety and panic attacks. He immediately put me on Valium 10mgs three times a day. He also put me on 12mg suboxone and 30mg of Adderall Xr. Within a week, I was feeling completely normal. And best of all, I had no cravings for heroin because my anxiety was gone. You might be thinking ""those are addictive substances"". And you would be correct. The reason they're addictive is because they work. If it wasn't for Valium, I'd still be using heroin off the streets, which means I'd potentially be dead. That is because heroin today is often laced with fentanyl, which is deadly at the level of a few small grains. So for all people that think benzodiazepines are so harmful, think again.

I'm guessing it's psychological, as I've ruled out diet and lifestyle habits as potential reasons why this is happening. I've always had occasional insomnia, but it seems to be getting worse. I take magnesium and melatonin because I don't want to take any mood-altering drugs, which will only open up a whole new can of worms that I have no desire to embark down that path. If anyone has been in a similar situation and has found results without the use of drugs or other mood-altering chemicals, please share your secrets with me.

And my dogs whining to go outside. How did this happen?  I usually wake up over my dogs whining through a motherly instinct I have. When a baby, dog, or cat cries I'm wide awake, even if the actual mother (my sister and cousin for example) is not.  The weirdest part though is the fact that my brother who sleeps just feet away from me was heard at the other end of the house yelling at me to get up and I don't remember a thing of it.  My mother is disabled and I am the only one who takes care of her and the dogs. Because of that I am pretty easy to wake up even in a deep sleep because I know I have things to do. When my dad comes home every couple months I sleep even harder and longer than usual because I know he can take care of things. Though I don't try to. So why, when I have so much to do and no one to fill in, did I sleep so deeply NO ONE could wake me up? In the end, I just woke up by myself. Thanks for any help in advance",
Sleep,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sleep/33524/trouble-getting-up-earlier-as-time-goes-on,Trouble getting up earlier as time goes on,"Lately, I've been having greater difficulty waking up early enough to have enough time to get ready for work and commute without feeling stressed or rushed or arriving ten minutes late. I don't doubt that the fact that mornings are dark at this time of year is partly to blame, but that alone can't be the only reason.  I have my alarms set to 5am and 5:30, but more and more I am getting up at 6 or closer to 6:30, and therefore have an hour or less to prepare before I'm catching my bus. This has resulted in me getting to work at 8-8:15am, which means I have no ""me time"" before I have to boot up my work computer and start cracking (I have a desk job). If I could just get up at 5:30 am at the latest, then I wouldn't be cutting things this close to the wire. Lately, I've had to choose between eating breakfast, taking a shower, or making lunch (showers have always taken precedence, since I can always buy breakfast and lunch, but that's not a good habit to be falling back on. In a perfect world, I take showers the night before, but life isn't always perfect). Now, here is another piece that makes this situation more frustrating: If I am to wake up at 5-5:30 am with the suggested amount of sleep (8-10 hours), that means I have to be ASLEEP by 7-9 pm! Which then means I have to be in BED by some ungodly hour because all my life it has taken me a good hour or two (or three; I never look at the clock when I'm trying to sleep because that would make it worse) to actually fall asleep. With getting home after work between 5:30 and 6 pm, that's just not possible. There is no way I can get the suggested hours for healthy sleep, which means I always will be struggling to get out of bed. I worry I will be sleeping in later and later with each day until I am consistently getting to work late. I can't even force myself to turn my bedside lamp on, and don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on some smart lamp with daylight-imitating bulbs. I am 28 years old and relatively healthy. There is no reason why this should be getting worse for me already at so young an age. No articles out there have any solutions that I've found to work for me. And on top of it all, I have always been a morning person. Once I actually get OUT of bed and drink a warm cup of tea, I am fine. But getting physically out of bed and keeping my eyes open before that is what is getting worse with each passing day. I apologize for the essay, but I wanted to be as detailed as possible. This situation is just really, really annoying, understandably.",

For the past 2-3 years almost daily, I will have huge swings in energy and mental clarity. I have tried numerous changes in my diet, and have had a lot if bloodwork done, seemingly with little change. When these dips in energy occur, I like to call them episodes as typically they only last 2-3 hours. The lingering effects can last all day at times. I have noticed that these episodes usually occur about 1-2 hours after waking up. Initially I will feel great from waking up, then a couple hours later it hits. I will hit a mental wall where I can't concentrate on hardly anything, my memory is very short and foggy, I will get a heavy sensation in my head and especially towards my upper neck area near the base of my skull. I will also get a tightness in my chest accompanied sometimes by a harder, winded heartbeat. I work a desk job, and sometimes my focus is so bad I have to sit in my car for a couple minutes to ""regroup, which can temporarily help, if only for a bit. I don't get any nausea along with this.  I recently started getting a lot of blood work done as back in September I had a couple of really bad episodes in the evening where I felt like I was going to pass out. Mental confusion, numbness in extremities and unable to control body temperature occurred. My doctor and I noticed that in my blood work my iron levels looked low (I will post some numbers below). Sure enough, after I started taking iron supplements 130 mg daily, the feelings of passing out went away. However I really haven't noticed much of an effect on my morning energy episodes.  I have some interesting medical issues I think could be pertenient such as 5 years ago I used to drink diet coke like it was water and i would have severe dizzyness, headaches and balance issues. Come to find out it was the aspartame. I have completely cut out aspartame since then. I also follow a somewhat close gluten free diet, as I seem to get tired after eating gluten.  I'm a 30 year old male, and make it a habit to work out 5 days a week. Cardio/weight lifting. 7-8 hours of sleep a night, low stress, 60-70 bpm heart rate. 50's resting. Transferrin 242 mg/dl.

I therefore took a high dose of my Propranolol. In total I took 80mg.  I have read online that this is still an OK amount to take depending on th severity of the anxiety. Mine was very high- and it definitely got me through! However as this is a high one-off dose, I'm a little worried if it is safe to just not take any at all tomorrow and so on.

Sleep,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sleep/33609/narcolepsy-hypersomnia-i-need-help,Narcolepsy? Hypersomnia? I need help...,"As a teenager, I slept a lot. My family assumed it was normal. However, looking back, I would sleep 12-14 hours at times, never feeling rested.  In my Early 20's.... I spent a lot of late nights partying and often didn't sleep but a few hours. For years, I equated my exhaustion with my life style.  Now that I am in my 30's, I've become quite tame. I hardly drink alcohol and I entertain myself with house work. I have a great job and a wonderful wife. No kids and 3 cats.  My exhaustion has never left. Several years ago - my ""Sleep attacks"" started. Typically it was after a heavy meal - especially a big bowl of pasta! soon afterwards, I visited a Gastro Doctor and found out that I had a Gluten intolerance. Removing the Gluten from my diet defiantly helped with my stomach issues but the Sleep attacks persisted and gradually got worse.  For the last few years I started having trouble driving andfalling asleep. I would wake up and instantly feel the need to lay on the floor (in the shower) and take a nap. The morning lethargy was the worst for sure although it would sometimes effect me in the afternoon and more than not around 8 or 9 O'clock at night.  After a 2 week run of falling asleep at the wheel daily, I went to a neurologist who diagnosed me with sleep apnea. I was given a APAP and Nuvigil for Daytime sleepiness. 6 months of APAP Theropy had shown significant progress in my sleep,although I still suffered from Lethargy and daytime exhaustion. There were a few days I forgot To take my Nuvigil in the morning and experienced terrifying Sleep attacks. One of the more recent was an episode of 5 different attacks with in a two hour span on my way to work. The others have included sleep attacks, a single Vivid hallucination and vision issues.  As for hallucinations - I do not typically have vivid visual hallucinations - I typically see movement out of the corner of my eye. More than not my Hallucinations are auditory. I will hear my name called or a single word or music while I am falling asleep or having a sleep attack! This auditory hallucination will often cause me alarm and I will jump at the sound but my alertness quickly changes back to lethargy in seconds.  When I do have visual hallucinations - they are Typically while falling asleep or awaking from a dream. Again this is rare and I have only recently experienced these visual hallucinations during daytime sleep attacks. Specifically the vivid one - where I saw a man crossing the road with a blue plaid shirt, holding a 2x6 under his arm going to check the mail... While I looked for him as not to hit him (I was driving), I believe what I saw was the side of a house. I realize this seems crazy and I really can't explain it.  My Neurologist has asked me several times about Cataplexy and I don't believe I have experienced this. Then again, I am not one to be easily excited by laughter or anger. I have always been very even keel and laid back. However, I never mentioned this to my doctor but when I am dealing with a sleep attack, I feel like i could fall over. My head will nod and have a need to sit or lay down. I would compare the feeling to being up for days and finally standing in front of your bed. Is that lose of muscle control? I also notice that when I am in the midst of a sleep attack and trying to fight it, I feel a sudden jolt sensation - like a mild warm electrical current run through my arms, my hands and my upper torso. I just assumed that it was my body trying to keep me awake.  In the evenings, I typically become so tired that it I lack the energy to even sit up. Sometimes, I slump over and often struggle to keep awake. I have noticed that in this state, I have trouble comprehending what someone is saying to me. I also have trouble stringing words together to answer or express myself to the person I am talking to. I often express this state of being as feeling drugged or drunk. My eyes cross and when I speak my words tend to be slightly slurred or not crisply pronounced. I often will replace words with other words that aren't even in the context of what I am talking about (i.e. while talking recently about a cabinet - I referred to the hinge as a ""faucet"") or I will tell my wife I am going to bed because I am ""Sleep"".  I am scared to miss a dose of my medication. I typically take my medication in the morning and sit for a little while and wait for it to kick in before I leave for work. With my Medication (250 Mg Nuvigil) - Its not like being on a medication like Adderall or Concerta where I feel awake and energized. I still feel tired at times during the day but the sleep attacks (if any) are very mild and I don't ever need to worry about falling asleep behind the wheel.  So here is my problem, I have no diagnosis. I was told that it could be Narcolepsy or Idiopathic Hypersomnia. Unfortunately, there is additional testing needed, Including a 2 day sleep study (or one night and one day). So at the moment, no one seems to know exactly why I experience what I do. I have read up on both and where I do see similarities in both - I don't feel that I am exactly 100% either.  This is effecting my work and my home life. My wife has implied that I am lazy and all I need to do is get up and move around. My boss has seen some changes is the quality of work I put out. I love my wife more than anyone in the world and I have a great job. I have a good life and I am scared this issue I am dealing with could destroy it all.  I NEED HELP! Is there anything I can do in the meantime that will help me feel more awake? The Nuvigil has been a god send - but in the morning I have to wait for it to kick in and in the evenings after work, I come home, do a few chores and then sit until I feel my condition start to take over - then I don't move from the couch.  I currently don't exercise and haven't for about 3-4 years. I use to Workout religiously! People told me it would make me feel better. Except it never did... I always felt exhausted after working out at the gym. My wife tried waking me up in the morning and make me walk around the neighborhood but prior to my medication, it didn't help... I would still have sleep attacks while driving to work. I have a diet that primarily consists of Vegetables, the occasional chicken breast or fish, No gluten or processed foods, limited alcohol (and if I do have a drink it is some sort of vodka drink 1 or 2 oz) - very limited soda intake (1 can a month or less). I am 34 years old, Male and I weigh 172 lbs.  Other Diagnosis that I have- Anxiety disorder (controlled with medication- although recently hasn't done a great job) Sleep apnea (controlled with APAP)  Gluten Intolerance (controlled with diet) Pre-Hypertension (controlled with Diet - Typical blood pressure reading is 117-122 over 71-78)  Trichotillomania and Dermatillomania (disorders probably related to my anxiety but have gotten worse over the past year)  Attention Deficit Disorder (Not controlled since taking Nuvigil)  Any insight or help on this issue would be great. I do have a sleep study coming up in January and I have been referred to John Hopkins Sleep Disorder Center but I am waiting to hear from my neurologist to see how to go about transitioning to another sleep center.  I realize this all seems pretty bad (and it is) but I also feel that it is not as bad as it appears to be from this synopsis. These few paragraphs are so condensed and I have hit on the extremes of my condition. I Suffer every day but most are tolerable. I would even say hardly noticeable - It's the one day out of 10 or 20 that scares me half to death.  Sorry to write a book but I feel the more information I can provide, the better advice I receive.

My current schedule is waking up at 0500, go to work 0600 until 1700, go home spend a little bit of time with my family then back to work 1900 until 2300 I get home shower and grab a small bite to eat ending up in bed around 0000 or 0030. After I wake up and get moving I feel fine, awake, alert no issues even without caffine or other substances to help the waking up process. In the mornings it's hard to get up on time and I will tell my wife I'm awake when really I'm not awake, I know some of it has comes from my amount of sleep as well as stresses but I'm looking for advice on how to help remedy this.",

I work with a therapist regularly and we have been monitoring my mood, feelings, symptoms. Its been about 2 weeks since i have seen her and my feelings have been amped up. Work has been very stressful and this past week was the 10 anniversary of my Mothers passing. I am weepy, slightly anxious, and having a hard time of letting stuff go- slightly obsessing. In addition, a friend recently told me if you do go off cold turkey- the drug won't work if you try to go on it again. I've call my doctor and will make an appointment to see him, but it could be a week or so - I have to travel for work. I'm not depressed, and can pretty much control the anxiety by distracting myself, etc. I am wondering the following: 1. Should I start taking the meds again immediately (Its been about 4 weeks) 2.

Feel free to skip to the last paragraph if you don't have time / care for the context. If you do, here's the context: So, I have what I suppose would now be considered a chronic pain issue because I'll be needing a third surgery (different from my previous surgeries) on the same area. I've been prescribed Tramadol/Ultram 50mg every 8 hours to deal with the pain. Two weeks ago, I had taken 3 pills for 2 days in a row where I had a lot of pain, and then took 1 pill on the third day. I was unable to get my medication for 5 days, and I got both restlessness (which I normally get if I don't wane down properly) and depression. I don't even know if I could call it depression since I've never had depression before, but it fits the definition. This sounds like the end of the story, but nope. When I went back to taking my normal 1 pill each day (which is less than I'm supposed to, and what I normally do, as you can see), I lost my restlessness, but the depression remained. 10 days went by, and my depression got better at points and got worse, but it never left. I'm in pain now because, even though I have my fully prescribed medication, I need this depression to go away so I can be productive again, even if it means I get restlessness or pain for a few days, as I have college work I need done by this weekend and I cannot do it if I'm depressed all day every day as I've been. My question: What do I do? I'm about to be on my third day without taking any medication, I'm in pain, I still have the depression. Is taking my medication going to make it take longer for this depression to go away, as I suspect? Should I start planning to see specialists to deal with my depression? I'm just not sure what to do.","Depression , Substance Abuse"

My penis started to get raw right underneath the head of my penis as i must be rubbing alot. I finally set up a camera and it appears that i will masturbate at times on and off for hours, cumming 2 or even 3 times. I now have to sleep naked so i dont have to do as much laundry.

More troubling concerns is when i sleep away from home, i have stayed in Hotels and woke up with my curtains open and im naked on the bed, i have woken up with my door open and several times woken up to another person in my bed whom i did not know and finding out i had sex with a total stranger. Whats even scarier is not knowing what has happen the times i woke up with my door open and im just laying on bed naked, people have left me notes telling me they had a good time. Does anyone know how to control this? My sex drive when im asleep appears to be off the hook,to avoid getting my penis rubbed raw i now cover my penis in lotion before i fall asleep, it seems to somewhat work but i do end up rubbing the lotion mostly off.

There is a lot of detail to cover, but I will try to be as brief as possible: Background facts: 1)	Father was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, paranoid-type 27 years ago, a few months prior to my birth; his brother had already been diagnosed with schizophrenia, and committed suicide roughly 20 years ago; their mother also had an indeterminate psychological disorder (since whatever she had probably pre-dated the classification of many psychological disorders) 2)	I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child, and up until the event that occurred two years ago (which I will explain shortly), I was medicated with various ADHD drugs (first Ritalin, then Adderall, then Concerta), and I believe I was misdiagnosed in the first place, and that I instead had (and have) an anxiety disorder (which I have an appointment for), in addition to possibly being on the autism spectrum Here is the story (from the beginning): Early 2015, my father experienced back-to-back psychotic breaks, a few weeks apart. His medication (Zyprexa) stopped working, but his doctor was unconcerned and figured these were isolated incidents (since this was the first psychotic break he had since his initial diagnosis). He gradually began to deteriorate; as recent as a few months prior, he was totally stable aside from occasionally hearing voices, but by March or April of 2015, he was having active visual and auditory hallucinations, and was regularly unable to distinguish reality from perception. It started out manageable. At nights he would wander the streets without shoes or socks; he would wake up my mother in the middle of the night telling her he has somewhere to go; he would wake me up to tell me my mother is dead, even though she wasn’t. We got used to this, but within months he got much worse. He refused to shower, stating that he is allergic to water (at one point he hasn’t showered for 6 months). He began talking to himself, exhibiting huge shifts in mood and personality, occasionally screaming at walls and trying to climb through windows. We told the doctor, who didn’t seem particularly concerned by the situation. So we had to take measures into our own hands. We didn’t feel safe having him live upstairs, so we convinced him that he had to live in the basement in a spare room, which solved our anxieties briefly. Within a week however, he was regularly screaming “leave me alone!” He began punching walls. He would continue wandering in the night, so we had to install cameras to regularly monitor his location. After a few more times of him coming upstairs to wake me up and tell me that my mother is dead, we decided that the basement door had to be locked overnight for our safety, and for us to be able to even sleep or feel safe. Things continued to get worse. He communicated that he wanted to burn the house down and kill the dog, so we called an ambulance. He was determined to be sound of mind and stable, and was released home within two days. Within hours of being home, he reverted back to his previous behavior, but worse. We would wake up to the sound of him punching the windows on our floor to get in. Or, if we were lucky, he would only attempt to open the basement door every 5 minutes, frequently banging on the door and screaming to get in throughout the night. He began punching the walls in the basement and acting very irregular, so out of fear that he may start the house on fire or hurt himself, we called an ambulance again. And again he was released back home within two days. By this point, I had begun smoking copious amounts of marijuana just to cope with the stress (in addition to taking my prescribed Concerta for ADHD, which I needed to help focus as a logistics analyst). For the latter months, I took it upon myself to regularly check the basement camera throughout the night to make sure he is still in his room, occasionally being able to sleep through the sounds of him screaming and banging on the door. (For the record, whenever we would open the door to see why he is screaming and banging, he would always have a confused look on his face, turn around and return to his room, before repeating the previous behavior minutes later.) I was getting very little sleep, and even during my waking hours, at work, on the train to and from work, in my free time, I was almost constantly in a state of fear that at any moment, my father would murder my mother or burn the house down. This is why I was (during every waking hour) checking the cameras regularly. I would be lucky if I averaged 2-3 hours of sleep for the latter months before my own incident. On top of this, we hadn’t had insurance for many months, and all of the medical bills for all of his hospital stays began piling up, with regular phone calls from hospitals, and new bills in the mail every single day. It had reached a point where the scariest part of some days was just checking the mail (at this point, mom and I were in a constant state of high anxiety). I also needed to take lots of time off work, which filled me with additional fear of losing my job (since at this point, my mother relied entirely on my income). This all eventually escalated to my father attempting to grab a knife after the 7th time we ultimately had to call the police. This was deeply traumatic for mom and I. We were emotionless zombies at this point, and by then the fear of my mom having a nervous breakdown weighed heavily as well, on top of my fear of him returning home. About two days later, he was still hospitalized, and we had brief moments of comfort, but they were often interrupted by the impending fear that he will soon be released home, again, as he was the previous 6 times. During the first weekend after his 7th hospitalization that year (mid-October 2015), I wanted to relax and distract myself from the almost paralyzing fear that dad will be released home, so I had what can only be described as a tremendous amount of marijuana, plus my usual dose of Concerta, after several days of still not sleeping more than 2-3 hours per night (since occasionally, dad would be released and dropped off in a cab in the middle of the night). And after a few hours of chain-smoking marijuana, I “had an epiphany” and almost instantly became manic. I began writing essays on the history of gladiators, detailed and sourced, dozens of pages long. I began reading the works of Socrates. I began thinking that I would write a book that would change the world. I was suddenly very happy, and also extremely hyper. At the time I was 380lbs and sedentary, but suddenly I wanted to jog, which I did for a while. During the following 7 days, I continued to smoke marijuana heavily, in addition to taking Concerta. I was sleeping even less now, spending much of my free time reading philosophy and writing the outline of my treatise that would change the world. Then on the 7th day, I experienced my first hallucination, at work. I observed myself getting a candy bar out of a vending machine without quarters, and concluded that I must be able to control the vending machine with my mind. Luckily I am extremely skeptical by nature, so I reasoned that the only logical conclusion was that I hallucinated, since telekinesis is impossible. The next morning I went to the emergency room, and they promptly diagnosed me with bipolar and hospitalized me for 7 days, after which I was released back into the world. The drug they prescribed me with (Depakote) gave me intense anxiety, where I would have panic attacks if the phone rang. This intense anxiety eventually led to job loss. Luckily, after the 7th time of calling the police on dad, the hospital finally determined that he is not safe to live with us, so he was (and continues to be) permanently institutionalized at a state facility. I was able to get both of my parents on Medicaid, and luckily they were able to cover all of his medical bills retroactively. I eventually overcame the anxiety after I stopped taking medication, and since then (two years later) I am entirely back to normal. I also stopped taking medication for my ADHD, and discovered that I didn’t really need it, and that I may have simply been slightly addicted to it. As was the case before my dad’s psychotic breaks, I am very emotionally stable. I don’t have mood swings. I never experience anger, for the most part. I cry and laugh at appropriate moments. Other than the occasional blues, I have always been (and continue to be) emotionally stable. So here is my question: is it possible that I am not bipolar, and that I simple experienced an isolated manic episode caused by incredible stress, sleep deprivation, extremely heavy drug use, and trauma? Everyone who knows me cannot believe that I am bipolar, myself included. Is there any evidence of manic episodes happening without being bipolar? If so, does this seem like a circumstance that could result in a manic episode without bipolarity? At this point, is it possible to be diagnosed as not bipolar? Thanks in advance if you have made it this far! Hoping that some consensus can be made here.",Bipolar Disorder

Even when I don't need to go I can feel a slight discomfort in my urinary tract/bladder. It feels exhausted. Apart from this issue, I feel perfectly fine and have no other conditions. None of this is painful, just incredibly annoying. Some other things to consider: - I have a slight belly, but not seriously overweight.  - I've masturbated with the same technique since I was 13 and sometimes wonder if I've done damage that way - I don't drink coffee and only have a few beers a week.

About her: 17 years old, 2 parent household, goes to a public school, has 2 brothers that are older and are in college away from home. Heres her story... So about 2 years ago (give or take) she went through a bad breakup and got out of a somewhat abusive relationship where all the guy wanted was sex and once he figure out that she didn't want to have it he broke up with her and treated her badly even after they broke up.  So for the past few years she has been struggling with anxiety and depression. She has gone through spells where she can eat because her stomach hurts too bad because she is over thinking or where she can't sleep because her brain is just too active. The past year that we have been dating I have been someone for her to count on and put trust in so that she has someone there for her. But she still struggles to live day to day because anxiety and depression just affect her and her ability to make friends and just function in daily life in general. She doesn't act suicidal and hasn't self harmed yet but she knows that this is affecting her daily day to day life. The biggest problem with this whole situation is her parents. Her parents don't believe that ""mental health problems are a real medical problem"" and this is a problem because they wont take her to get treatment in any way shape or form. ( To put this into perspective, her father wouldn't let her brother take ADHD meds when he was young because he didn't believe that anything was wrong even though there clearly was because he was having serious trouble in school.) She has asked them for help and all they do is put her on simple vitamins because they just shrug it off as a vitamin deficiency or some other insignificant problem. She is aware that these thing are affecting her life and asks me for help because she doesn't know what to do... So, heres what i'm asking... 1. How do I help her and what steps can I take to help her in any way possible? 2. How could I convince her parents to get her help? 3. What to do, I feel really bad that I can't help her? 4. What free resources might be available to help? 5. Anything that could make a difference.

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/32537/i-am-so-over-it,I am so over it.,"I'm a 29 year old single mom and I have had depression for most of my life. I live with my parents in a house full of people (6 adults and 3 children in a 4 bedroom house).  My mom has bad depression. It has affected me since I was 12. She would be in the psychward off and on for most of high school. I'd walk on eggshells and wonder why my mom didn't love me enough to want to live. She would use her depression to win fights. ""Well I'm just going to kill myself then."" Or with my dad it would be, ""maybe we should just get a divorce."" I love my mom because she's my mom, but I don't like her as a person. She's manipulative. She's a bully. She talks down to people and tries to control everyone. If you try to stand up for yourself or call her on what she's doing she turns into a victim and acts like everyone gangs up on her. We'll sit here all week doing nothing and the minute I want to clean my room or go do something she suddenly needs me to do something for her.  I planned a cruise for my daughter and I next year, but the catch is that its over the weekend that is my boyfriend's birthday and my parents anniversary. My boyfriend offered to drive me from Oregon to California ON HIS BIRTHDAY and she complained that I wouldn't be here to watch my niece and nephew for her anniversary (""I guess we won't celebrate our anniversary."") that is 10 months away. She gets jealous if anyone is enjoying their life. When a big event happens (wedding, birthday, pregnancy) she ends up in the psychward. She constantly flips out about little things and yells at everyone and then accuses us of disrespecting her. My parents have martial problems (they split for a few years and got remarried last year) and out of nowhere she'll bring up the past.  So yes my mom has depression and yes I have it to, but the difference is I WANT TO GET BETTER. I WANT TO ENJOY MY LIFE AND BE HAPPY.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression"

She said that after a weekend with me, they asked too many questions, and she does not want to expose them to my poor behavior again. I didn't realize my craziness was that obvious. For me, the weekend was one of my best - I only binged and purged once (after everyone had gone to bed), I drank but not to oblivion, I played with the kids and joked around, I didn't hurt myself, and I had so many happy memories. Her words cut so deep that I don't know how I can get past this - I have had multiple suicide attempts, struggle with anorexia and bulimia, depression, self harm, anxiety...family is that one thing that makes it all worth it. But most of all, I am mortified and SO ashamed. I never want to hurt the ones I love, and it seems like no matter how hard I try I end up causing pain anyway. I'm so sad that I can't see the kids anymore, even though I completely understand. I tried so hard that weekend to be ""normal"" around food and to keep my anxiety and depression at bay.

Symptoms: lower back pain, started around 18 months ago and progressively getting worse, mainly at night causing severe lack of sleep with sudden need to move violently and stretch back/legs but find it hard to stand up or walk properly. Lack of sleep adversely affecting quality of life (1-4 hours per night) Accompanied with violent leg seizures/spasms and numbness in both/either legs, attacks can happen up to 8 times per night lasting 5-15 minutes each. Stretching or hurting legs/back seems to alleviate pain Urge to urinate when waking up through the night alongside sweating Saw GP at walk in centre around 6 months ago who thought it could be back strain and fallen arches and to try some of the following Treatments: Switched to memory foam mattress Using trainers with memory foam and arch support Stretching routine designed for lower back pain Weight loss started Relaxation techniques (hot drink, bath, book, bed etc) Extra care taken when manual handling Use of deep heat/freeze and OTC painkillers only provide temporary relief Massage therapist seen Lavender and Epsom salt baths Different sleeping positions (pillow between legs, pillow under knees, side, back, frontal positions etc) Sleeping on hard floor seems to help back pain sometimes Results so far: Suggestions from GP have helped alleviate some of the pain but symptoms still persist and beginning to get stronger. Beginning to feel the affects of lack of sleep in cognitive thinking, balance/clumsiness, forgetfulness, strained relationships with partner and children, irritable, short tempered and impatient.

My only concern is that I don't understand what exactly is the cause of my headaches? I know that bad sleeping position (like sleeping on my stomach, which twisting the neck) may compress the nerves c2 and c3 which cause a Cervicogenic headache, but I am not sure that this is the actual cause of my headaches because if i go back to sleep for half an hour (in the morning) i feel great afterward, if not i feel bad for the whole day, so essentially the ""back to sleep"" thing cures my pain. So my only conclusion is that lack of deep sleep (and maybe rem sleep) may compress (spasms) the nerves C2 and C3 and then it causes a Cervicogenic headache, does someone know something about it? i am suffering from this headache for so many years, it's actually ruined my life (and still). Because of the occipital neuralgia i got a nerve block with no help, then I got the nerve block with ultrasound and it helped for a short while, so the next step is to do the cervical medial branch block (2 times before the RFA), i am not sure that the cercival RFA will do the job, any info can help, any connection between poor sleep (many arousals and/or lack of deep or rem sleep) and cervical headaches can help. thanks  Dalton",Insomnia

I told her I didn't feel good and she thought I just meant I needed to throw up so she took me to the bathroom. when I stood up I could hardly see anything, my vision was blacking out, and I could barely hear, it's like I could only hear my heartbeat and the blood rushing in my head really loud.

I've been stressed about a big change coming up in my life that's been causing me unhappiness for years, on top of working constantly on my feet, barely eating or drinking fluids, and I recently started smoking cigarettes. with all of this information, did I have a seizure, a panic attack, or something else??  some other things I remembered since my last post: I was smoking a lot of cigarettes and a black & mild so the nicotine could have had effects, I had only eaten twice that day one of which was McDonald's, and had only had coffee and little water, and supposedly when I went upstairs my girlfriend's dog was freaking out and barking more than usual.

I had asthmas issues as a small child but most of my adult life I was not bothered unless I was sick. I smoked for 40 years. I quit May of 2017 and my asthma has done nothing but get worse. I was aware thing would get worse before they got better but it is almost 2 years now. I work in an environment that has latex balloons regularly inflated. Could my lungs recovering from smoking now be sensitive to the latex in the air? Is there any way for me to figure this out? I've had the same job 18 years and it was a within the first years after I started working that my asthma started becoming more active. I never thought there could be a connection. I just figured it was my age. Any ideas. I don't want to give up my job but I may need to see if I have options.,

Now at 29, I find myself continuing these horrible sleeping patterns. My question is: is it possible to repair the damage that's being done to my brain? I've read countless articles about how you lose brain cells and all of the other ailments sleep deprivation leads to. I'm trying hard to overcome my unhealthy sleeping patterns, but this is me trying to unlearn a lifetime of terrible habits, and I clearly haven't overcome them yet.  I already suffer from some things that I'm are most likely due to chronic sleep deprivation: memory loss, trouble recognizing people I've seen before, chronic worrying, depression, lack of motivation, irritability, heart problems (irregular heart beat), fatigue and emotional instability (I can sometimes cry at the drop of a hat, but suppress this in public and work spaces).  Has anyone been on the same boat and turned their life around? Is it possible for me to repair my brain? I just need to know if there's some sort of hope, because as terrible as I am to myself, I want to do what I can to recover and restore. I'm so worried about irreversible brain damage and what that will do to my career and quality of life. I don't need convincing on how important sleep is and I'm aware that I have a problem that needs to change immediately. As much of a challenge as it's been, I intend to sleep better and practice meditation and other healthier habits more. In case other health factors need to be taken into consideration: I try to eat as many plant-based food as possible (but am not vegetarian), the only drug I occasionally do is marijuana (and that's 1-4 times a month if at all) through a hit or two of a pipe, I drink coffee to stay awake, although it doesn't help much, and I don't exercise enough, although that's also something I intend to change. I'm not overweight, although I'm not fit and have vitamin deficiency (D and B) and osteopenia.  I know I'm a hot mess, but I'm determined to change.

It did help reduce my AHI from 50's to mid-20's, but my sleeping has not improved and I continue to wake up throughout the night and feel fatigued in the morning, day and night. I've lost my mental sharpness and have become very irritable which has taken its toll on me personally and professionally.  So I did an experiment in an effort to narrow down the scope of what is causing my issues. I live in Colorado and wondered if altitude was an influencer. I recently travelled to Mexico on vacation and thought I would test my Oxygen levels between two drastic elevations (6300ft and Sea Level).  I didn't notice a difference in my sleep per se, but I did wake up much easier and with much more energy, unlike at home. What is interesting is that while I was at sea level, my SPO2 levels seem normal, hardly ever dropping below 90% (less than 1% of the time). However when at altitude, my SPO2 falls below 90%, which totalled 50 - 70% of my sleep time. See visualization (bar chart) My doctor wanted to put me on oxygen but of course insurance denied it (...to be continued). I'm considering if I need to move to lower altitude in order to get better sleep or if my sleep apnea and low SPO2 is a symptom of a much larger issue.

On a bad day I might wake up at 3:30. On a good day, if I'm very tired, I might sleep till 5:30. But I can't remember the last time I slept till 6:00. I make myself stay in bed till 5:30 regardless, but I usually spend the first 1 - 1 1/2 hours of every morning lying in bed awake.  I usually get about 6 hours of sleep a night. Not too bad, I know.

If it is inherited, wouldn't most sufferers have the problem all their lives as I have had? Are there any other younger folks like me who have it? Or am I basically alone in having this problem at my age? If anyone else has had this problem, what has helped? Only advice I could find in online research is to turn on bright lights at night (which would only mean I get to bed later, but still wake up early, and so get less sleep - not helpful in the long run), and to use dark curtains to shut out the light in the morning (which I am doing, and it helps a little, but not much since I am awake before it starts to get light anyway).  Medication is a possibility, some suggested Melatonin, but I don't want medication. Especially if it makes sleepy for too long in the mornings. I don't mind being an early bird- within reason!

I feel scared when it’s happening  5. I need to tell myself it will be over soon. 6. My temperature rises 7. Hairs on my body stand up 8.Then it stops and I try and remember what happened and can’t  9.i feel very sick  10. I can’t remember what I was thinking or who came into my mind. 11.

I am only 25 years old and otherwise fit and healthy. I have started taking a diary of when these happen and it seems to happen more when I am due my period.

I was a happy child, until changes around 8/9 years happened and my mom had stepfather, after stepfather after stepfather, I guess all she wanted was a family she never had while growing up, and after she lost her husband at age 33, hat dream was squashed, so she met my dad 5 years later I was born, it was an abusive relationship, he never worked, he was a ""man about town"", so they say, so my mom hid the truth of who my real father was, until I was around 10/11 my older sister, in a not so nice way, as I was the last one, I was also the favourite, and she told me all the characteristics of my dad, they were 4 from my mom's marriage, and they never warmed up to me, like me the way the last born child is normally liked in the family, so while growing up, along with the stain of being sexually molested by 3 men around 8/9 when the changes in my life took place, that never helped my esteem at all, so I became quieter and quieter and even failed subjects at school which required thinking i.e. mathematics, my mom never knew that the men she exposed me to, molested me also, I had no way of telling her, at the time, she was busy trying to be a ""wife"" or girlfriend and was also trying to be a mom to us, and she never could do a good job, as her own mom, wasn't there for her - right now im 37 and my mom is 75 and we have a good relationship - I once read somewhere, that ""the day a child becomes an adult, is the day he/she learns to forgive his/her parent"", I did, it wasn't easy, to get over the rejection of the world, being changed from house to house as some of my mom's boyfriends wanted only her, and not children, at some point in our lives, she chose the men over us, but it was a mistake, and everyone makes mistakes, no matter the degree, what is important is acknowledging it and learning from it - she later had a masters degree at the age of 55 and I have the utmost of respect for her, so we stopped seeing step fathers, after my middle school years, around 12/13 - but then my brother was the troublesome one at home and acted out a lot - drinking, breaking windows, jails, dropping of jail charges, our house was already known at the police station, my mom blamed herself, just like she blamed herself when I started smoking marijuana at the age of 22, I was diagnosed with bipolar and depression, after a suicide attempt and loss of reality, it was a scary period in my life and I acted out all those suppressed feelings and even one day hit my own mother, we got past that, I got therapy, for almost 10 years I saw one psychologist and psychiatrist - my siblings said I wanted ""attention"" so none of them ever came to visit me in hospital during any of my yearly depressive relapses, but I have them to thank for being the strong woman I am, I changed schools 5 times in my life, I have slept with more than a 100 men, out of acting out, I was so destructive, I tried suicide a couple of times, only to fail and one day I fell pregnant, at 27, and I gave birth to a baby boy-my current joy and light-although, at the time, I had post natal depression for almost two years and had no maternal insticts, my child was a product of my promiscuity and acting out, I look back now, everything happens for a reason, im in a 5 year marriage now, my son gets along so well with his stepfather, the first man to ever know what I faced in my life, he taught me to trust and respect a man, he is my friend, my confidante, like my mom and my son, my son makes me laugh so much through his over-active imagination - my problem is I want to stop smoking marijuana but I am so scared to live without it-it has been my source of comfort or balance for a long time and I feel now its becoming a burden more and more and am starting to hate it because my son is 11, and he knows and I feel so dirty, sort of not clean in my son's eyes, even though him and I have spoken about it - I feel I need to do right by him - I don't want him to get addicted to something else later in life in order to cope with life's stages, like my mom's mom used alcohol, my mom used men, I used men and marihuana - I live a double life and I have no one to tell this to, atleast someone who can look at me without judging me, I need help, a pillar, someone who can help get ovwer this thing, its controlling my life and has come to a point whereby I hate it - the sad part is, my partner also smokes, and its wrong, please help me, anyone?im","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Abuse Victims , Depression , Self Harm , Substance Abuse , Bipolar Disorder"
Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/32226/job-depression,Job Depression,"Hi, I am new to these message boards and have a problem that I am hoping to get advice on. All of my life, I have been hoping for and trying to work towards a professional career. I have 3 college degrees, an associates in liberal arts, a bachelors in journalism and recently went back to school for accounting and just completed a master's degree in accounting back in May of this year. Despite studying several different areas, all I can seem to find is administrative work. Right now I work at a CPA firm, but because I cannot seem to master the advanced tax returns and bookkeeping, I have to split my time between doing the lower level tax returns and helping our administrative assistant by filling in at the front desk and doing filing and other admin work. I am a middle aged woman who doesn't have a lot of time to keep going back to school and trying different things. I am trying to sit for the CPA test right now but that is not going too well either, you need a 75 to pass and I made a 69 on my first test. I am trying to get my next test taken, but it has been hard keeping a positive focus.  At this point in my life, I feel like a real loser. Its one thing to be an administrative assistant or secretary if you like the work and chose that, but if you don't (I absolutely hate it ) it can seem like you are a complete failure when you can't move on from it. I don't like it because I don't feel like it is a real profession, I get bored with the general office work and it is not challenging enough to spark any kind of curiosity or interest in me. I feel like I am starting to become a bitter, depressed person because I cannot meet my goals of being a professional. Another problem is, I am starting to have feelings of resentment and bitterness toward people in my life or at work who have made it and are now professionals in their field. For example, there are accountants and CPAs in my office. I used to like them when I first started working at the firm, but now I am starting to have feelings of jealously and resentment toward them because I see them moving up and I can't. I am also starting to not like the administrative assistant that I work with. Sometimes I have really bad feelings of resentment toward her and wonder how in the world she can be happy supporting others with no real career of her own.   I don't think these feelings are good for me or those around me and don't feel like I am going in a good direction in my life, but I don't know what to do at this point and need advice. I don't want to serve others in a support role and watch them grow while I get left behind. That is going to be too painful for me and I'm afraid one day I am going to just give up on working all together and become homeless or something. At this point what can I do? Leave accounting and go try something else? What would it be? At this point, I just don't know anymore and I don't understand why I have such strong feelings of wanting to move up in the corporate world and why I feel like such a loser because I have not been able to. If anyone has been through something like this, I would appreciate any advice.",Depression

We're pretty sure he stops breathing at night so we had a sleep study done. They put the airflow sensor in his nose and it amplified his breathing to where I could hear it. There were multiple times where he went from sounding like Darth Vader with his breathing sounds, to were I could hear nothing, then after about 15 seconds or so, he'd start again. It's a holiday week, and I know it'll be at least another week before we find out for sure if he does stop breathing at night. I can't find any information on this sensor and how it works, and when I asked the aid if that meant he stopped breathing, all he said was he wish he could tell me what that meant.  I'm wondering if what I was hearing meant that he probably did stop breathing. This test will most likely determine whether or not he has a decompression surgery, so I m a little anxious.  I get this seems like a, ""duh,"" sort of answer. But I'm trying not to jump to conclusions and see if maybe there's other reasons why you wouldn't hear the noise on the monitor. If maybe he was breathing quieter, or if it's a constant noise that should be made? Please that know that we're seeking helpful, kind, information. I'm stressed enough as it is worrying if he's going to need brain surgery so young, I'd rather you not leave anything nasty. I am just wondering how those sensors work. Thanks.",Apnea

She had ran into the room, and before I tell you what happened after she went in I want to notify you that I did not wake up during or right after the incident and did not notice anything strange when I did wake up. So as I was saying, she went in and saw me choking in my sleep, even not breathing at all. She said she went on the bed next to me and tried grabbing my arms to shake or move me, but when she did she told me my muscles were VERY stiff. She told me she was afraid to even grab it and forcefully moved it because she though that if she did she would end up breaking something. So instead she grabbed my shoulders, started shaking me and screaming my name because she said that she had felt that my soul/spirit was drifting away as if I was dying in my sleep even. This has happened on 2 occasions and I'm worried it could be something serious or I have anything similar or do have sleep apnea. Like my arms she said my whole entire body was stiff like I was a statue. I wasn't even moving or slightly shaking but as I said, very stiff. This went on for what she had told me a few minutes and the scene ended. After I still stayed sleeping and I peacefully released my body from the stiff stance for the rest of the night. It's only started happening and that last one was a few months ago. It's a rare occasion and I have no idea if it's even happened again since I don't wake up during this. I also wanted to note I had one or two occasions of feeling like I am trapped on my bed and can't move, then see a black shadow or creature walk across my room. During this scene I didn't have those common terrified thoughts it was more like empty, but now thinking back on it, it was actually really scary. And by posting this my goal is to figure out why I had this and what conditions are possible to cause this, I hope you find an answer to my question.","Apnea , Sleep Paralysis , Insomnia"

It can be so strong that it completely overwhelms me. It's very hard to explain how it works, and I have no idea why it works. There are a couple of different ways that I get different feelings from, but the most common one I use is to listen to music. I close my eyes and let amazing sights and events form themselves following the flow of the music. The best way to describe the feeling that overcomes me is being high; I get happy, my body feels great, I feel a surge of strength, and I'm in complete control. I can do it without music at all in completely different scenarios and my body thinks I'm actually there feeling it all.  It's comparable to how PTSD victims describe reliving trauma. I don't have PTSD myself, but like anyone, I have painful memories. I can't remember painful events without reliving them, I've learned to control this so it rarely ever happens.

It never ended up popping but it started hurting bad as if i had cramped or had a knot in that area. From there on i could not sprint or barely run. I finished the game off some how and throughout the game i tried massaging it out and stretching it. At halftime i even used the hypervolt massage gun on the spot but nothing got better. The spot was swelled up pretty good after the game. The next day (today) i still have some pain and swelling. I have had bilateral sports hernia repairs before on October and November of 2012. I have always had tight hips and left side lower back pain. This injury was sustained on my left leg. I just recently started squatting and working out legs. I have also started doing several workouts on the hip flexor machines at my gym with pretty heavy weight. Also prior to the game i was not getting much groin pain but i was having pain above my knee which inclined me to wear a knee brace. I wore the knee brace on my left leg as well. I am able to walk today with limp and there is not any severe pain. I have been icing it and taking 2 tables of motrin every 6-8 hours. I am looking for some advice or thoughts on what this could be.

I had been in great health, take ballroom dance lesdons. Started having abdominal GI dic could not diagnose. Suggested I take another Lorazapam. Then, when I had to have some minor surgery I was told to stop all meds. I did not know benzos must be withdrawn very slowly I had major withdrawal symptoms. A psychiatrist treated me by switching to Clonazapam, another benxo, and added Effexor for panic attacks and withdrawal symptoms. Only then did I learn you have to detox from Benzos AND Effexor very gradually. I am finally off the Effexor and it has been terrible. Even 2 weeks later I have symptoms. Now I must tsper off the Clonaxapam too. Very tired all the time. I recently learned that antibiotics in the Cipro family cannot be used with Benzos. I have needed them before so I really feel I must get off the Benzos entirely. I fo not know how long it will take or what to do about the insomnia if it returned. Basically I am saying don't take Benzos other that for acute medical reasons. You can become addicted in a week.

The thing is I'm not always depressed. Sometimes I can unnaturally happy and full of energy. Usually later on in the day. I want to see a medical professional (because a high school councilor isn't a doctor) and see what they have to say, but I'm not sure I want to take medication. It would likely be prescribed based on what I've read, but I'm concerned with some of the things I've read about them. They can make people really angry for reason and can increase suicidal thoughts. I suppose that if prescribed I would probably take them, but at what cost? Would I still be my self?

About a month and a half ago, I was on a red eye flight and had a grand mal seizure within an hour or so of falling asleep where I went tonic clonic for a few minuets. Didn't lose bowel control or bite my tongue, but was extremely fatigued and ended up in the care of a fellow passenger who was a doctor till we landed and was taken off the plane and hospitalized for about 5 hours after landing. Since then, I saw my personal doctor and they sent me to a neurologist. I have since had my driver's license suspended for at least 3 months pending no further seizures, and no abnormal follow up test results. I was given an EKG, EEG, CT scan, and an MRI so far. All came back with no abnormal results. I still have a pending sleep study that will be looking for sleep apnea. I do not have a known cause yet, but I was out drinking the night before my flight and dealt with a big hangover, lack of good sleep, didn't eat much the whole day, and didn't drink a ton of water as I was nauseous that entire day leading up to my flight (the night after I was out drinking). I was told each one of those things can bring it about, but also stress of which I am awful about way over stressing about work and reserves work. The whole reason for me bringing this up is that I have worked it out with my job to keep working with my license suspended, but I have to get to and from work under my own power and that makes me stay in a hotel within walking distance to my headquarters. Two times now since I started staying in this hotel I have had episodes of sleepwalking (that's the best way I know how to put it). In the middle of the night, I got up, not really aware of what I was doing at the time, needing to go use the bathroom and walked out of my hotel room to find a restroom. I ended up at the front desk with the help of some other person staying at the hotel and they took care of me and got me back in my room, but I had no idea what was going on and only loosely recall where I was and what I did. The hotel called my room the next day to check on me and that solidified to me what happened. That was the first time something like that ever happened to me and happened the first week I was in this hotel. The second time was last night, now two weeks later, but I put stuff in the way of my door to hopefully deter lucid me from making it outside again and it worked. I did randomly move things around the room and woke up on the couch instead of the hotel bed which I barely remember and was also paired with a dire urge to use the restroom in the middle of the night. I have no idea if these things could all be related. I don't know if I had a seizure before, but there is a chance as I have felt awful like I did after the episode on the plane, but did bite my tongue really bad on more than one occasion during sleep. I didn't tell my neurologist about those as I am terrified of losing my job which requires me to drive if I lose my license even longer. If anyone has any insight on what this could be and if it is possibly related to the seizure, I am freaked out about it all and don't want to be put on mess if I can avoid it all. If there's anything more needed or advice anyone might have, I would be very grateful.",Sleepwalking

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/82972/telehealth,Telehealth,"Telehealth is a fairly new innovation in the health care arena that allows patient and health care professionals the convenience of giving and receiving information. Telehealth is the use of digital information and communication technologies such as computers and mobile devices, to access health care services remotely and manage your health care (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2017). Telehealth is a great innovation for patients who have mobility issues or live far from medical facilities. Telehealth is beneficial tool in which patients will have pertinent information about their health at their fingertips. Patients are able to access information about their test results, ordering medication, scheduling appointments with provider(s), emailing your doctor, emergency information and more. Telehealth can also refer to remote non-clinical services, such as provider training, administrative meetings, and continuing medical education, in addition to clinical services (HealthIT.gov, 2017). Telehealth can be considered a wearable device because your personal health information can be accessed through wearable devices. The Health Resources & Services Administration, under the direction of the U.S. Department of Health and Human promotes the use of telehealth technologies for health care delivery, education, and health information services (Health Resources & Services Administration, 2019). Telegraph is especially critical in rural and other remote areas that lack sufficient health care services, including specialty care (Health Resources & Services Administration, 2019). The Office for the Advancement of Telehealth (OAT) promotes a variety of telehealth programs including Telehealth Network Grant Program (TNGP), Substance Abuse Treatment Telehealth Network Grant Program (SAT TNGP), Evidence-Based Tele-Behavioral Health Network Program (EB THNP), Telehealth Resources Center Program (TRC), Telehealth Centers of Excellence (COE), Flex Rural Veterans Health Access Program (RVHAP), Licensure Portability Grant Program (LPGP), and Telehealth and Focused Rural Health Research Center Cooperative Agreement (Health Resources & Services Administration, 2019).  Speaking from experience, I have benefited and enjoyed telehealth through my medical facility. I can obtain test results and medications through the system without having to contact my primary care facility. I can also stay in contact with my primary care physician and obtain referrals that I may have misplaced. If my physicians need to contact me or vice versus, we can email each other through the system. It is convenient for working adults that may not have time to see a medical professional.

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/30491/what-depression-is-it,What depression is it?,"Recently (for the past year), I've been noticing differnces in me but dismissed it. If there is something wrong, I have always tried to hide it. So very recently I have become suspicious of myself and looked online for symptoms and tests for depression. All the tests tell me that I am not severe but at a good risk— but I feel that I have a certain type of depression because I do not feel it all of the time. So I'm going to list what I feel and would like if someone knows what it is? I don't feel 'down' all the time. I am usually ok in the morning and middle of day. After the first class at school (orchestra), as I am walking to next class, I get a clench in my throat, the preasure behind my eyes. I feel bad; i can't describe it. I believe this is because i feel so helpless in that class. The music is very difficult and there is so much I have at once to work on. I used to love it, but now, when I know I should practice, I often am too afraid to start because of how overwhelming it is. So at certain times in the day I think of this, my inability to play my instrument like I used to and I feel that grief and guilt.   When I am in public and feel that sadness, I put my shoulders back, hold my head up, and remind myself no one should know my thoughts or see anything wrong. Thats another irrational fear. People knowing my thoughts. This happens one to three times a day during the school hours of a day the evening. Other than that and in between these times, I feel perfectly fine and normal. Maybe once a week I don't have a sad moment at all that day. Thrice to four times a week, the evenings are not good. I never show infront of my family, but sometimes in the shower I cant stand it. I can't describe the feeling— its like sad but more. I silent cry, crouched at the bottem of the shower. Sometimes when it is not shower time, I silently cry in my room. Also, I don't know if this is anything, but my hunger has become irratic. I have never been one to eat at certain times, but recently my hunger has reduced to very little a day. I am only really hungry about once or twice a day. But when I am hungry, I suddenly crave breads, carbs, sweets, fruits, and very little vegetables. And when I am hungry, I eat everything and a lot of foid. I know it is unhealthy and I should eat balanced meals regularly, but oftentimes I can't help it. And on the weekends I stay in bed or ly around mist of the time. Sometimes I think that if I didn't have to go to school, I would never do anything because I often have trouble convincing myself to do something. Another thing is I am constantly being irritated. My mother constantly nagging me; my brother picking at me; having to repeat myself more than twice; the way the people in my family call my name, dragging the syllables out in a whiny voice as if I were a small, stupid child. Just one of these things can make me explode, though I know I shouldn't.  I do not know what type this is or what determines what I have, so I apologize for listening and describing everything I can think of that has changed in the past year.","Depression , Personality Disorders"

The whole cureent situation of mine has been making me feel overtly depressed and the thought of ending my own life is not one that has left me for more than a day now , but I can't do something like that to my family , who truly love me, but theres no one I can talk to ryt now who'll understand , coz my family thinks I've studied and I am ready for exams , and also with mom being unwell I can't worry them more. I don't have any frnds to talk to. I just need help in ending this feeling of helplessness. I need help!!!!",

His medical treatments have spanned painkillers, physiotherapy, steroids , Epidural Steriod Injection without usage of fluoroscopy, Ganglion Impar Block (Diagnostic). The pain seems to worsen . His latest PSA levels are 0.30 and hence the oncologist has ruled out a recurrence.  Has anyone else experienced something similar?  The pain management has been a failure. He has consulted the range of doctors - urologist, Orthopedician, Neurologist, Oncologist ... apparently after 3 years of medication , painkillers and some physiotherapy last month now consultants have suggested maybe the pain is a nerve entanglement caused during surgery.

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/80425/swollen-arm,Swollen Arm,"I do Crossfit and workout 3-4 times a week. This last Monday we did a hero workout which is a really long high intensity workout in honor of a fallen soldier or first responder. There was a lot of movements which involved the biceps. During the workout my biceps felt tight but nothing too out of the normal. On Tuesday I was feeling stiff and my arms were kind of stuck bent, but not sore. I skipped the workout Tuesday because I was feeling a little dizzy and lightheaded in the afternoon. Wednesday I was still stiff but it was starting to hurt and was difficult to extend my arms. I made sure to stretch a lot throughout the day and went to the gym Wednesday and did the workout hoping it would help me loosen up. I've experienced this stiff and soreness in the past but have not had it happen in the last 7 months that I've been doing Crossfit. Normally we are pretty warmed up and stretched out. I attributed the stiffness to DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness). Thursday came and I was still stiff and sore but now I had noticed my biceps were swollen, my left bicep a lot more than my right. Thursday was my rest day so I did not go to the gym. Friday left bicep is the same. I've never experienced this before. I eat healthy and drink lots of water daily. I've taken Naproxen to help the inflammation but it doesn't seem to do much. Worst case scenario I was thinking Rhabdomyolysis, but so far I do not have any other symptoms. It's been four days since I worked out now, should I be worried? Should I give it the weekend to see what happens? Sucks cause I was just at the doctors office Thursday for my annual wellness exam and hadn't noticed the swelling till after. Doctor didn't notice it either. What should I be doing to help the swelling? Should I skip the gym today (Friday) and rest? Was thinking of going to talk to the coaches more and maybe just do some cardio or leg workouts.",

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/78887/compressed-ulnar-nerve,Compressed Ulnar Nerve,"Hello - I hope this is the right forum, I didn't see anything more specific to my conditions. I appear to be experiencing some Ulnar Nerve compression in my left arm. Here is some background on what led up to this. I am a 33 year old Male, about a week and a half ago I was working on cutting deer meat when I cut up near the left tip of my middle finger (of the left hand) with a knife. I cleaned up the cut, applied isopropyl alcohol and Neosporin to the cut and put a bandaid on it. At the time I had no numbness or odd sensations in my hand. About 3-4 days after I took the bandage off and was noticing that I appeared to have some numbness in my hand, along with some pressure around the palm of my hand. I then started experiencing some warmthness in this hand, extending partially up my arm. When this started occuring I went to a Walk In clinic who looked at the cut and my hand and other than the cut didnt see anything abnormal. They prescribed me a 10 day supply of Amoxicillin for an antibiotic (in case there eas an infection from the cut) along with a 5 day supply of Prednisone, along with a Tetnis shot. I am not on my last day of the Prednisone course and I feel like I have much better sensation in my left hand and that my numbess is gone, however I've had compression in my Ulnar nerve for the past few days. The compression appears to be centered mostly near my elbow, either on the inner side of the Funny bone, or just above it in my upper arm. It feels like in that one spot like the never is being pinched. I have no idea if the cut to my finger in any way could have caused this, or if it's pure coincidence. I will say that I have never experienced anything similar to this before. From what I understand the Ulnar nerve covers your pinky finger and right side of the ring finger, whereas my cut was to my middle finger so I dont know how the cut to the middle finger would affect the Ulnar nerve. Is it possible that I have some inflammation from the cut that is somehow affecting this nerve? Would you expect to see this compression if you did have an infection?  I'm trying not to worry too much but at the same time I don't want to ignore the problem. Would a hand Surgeon be a good option to make an appointment with if this doesn't resolve over the next fee days or what would you recommend doing? Thank you very much for your feedback!

I think he fell depressed after his mom died almost 14 years ago. He's basically been drinking by himself in the basement since. Last week he thought the bathtub was his bed, and in a drunken state, fell into it. My mom is currently on vacation until the 27th, so my aunt and uncle kicked down the door to have him hospitalized after they couldn't get a hold of him for ~12 hours. He forced his discharge and went home. No medication was prescribed, just recommendation for multi-vitamins and thiamin. I flew home to take care of him at this point. Since then, he hasn't showered and has had bathroom breaks every 30 minutes, including at night. He doesn't actually pee much every time, but he is unable to sleep due to this urination schedule. He is severely sleep deprived. He has also been constipated although he did poop in his bed one night. He hasn't been drinking any alcohol, barely eats (maybe 1-2 pieces of bread every day) and no water as he doesn't want to pee even more. His mobility is also affected by the bathtub incident; he ""walks"" slower (it's more of a shuffle) and can't get himself out of his reclining chair 80% of the time (he says he hurt his left hip when he fell). He also can't bend over or pull up his pants. He is always wheezing for air as he is overweight and never ever exercises or even walks anywhere!  This morning I asked him how he's doing and he gave me the usual ""just fine."" I asked him if he slept and he said no. I asked him, ""can you please go to see a doctor today?"" He got angry with me and told me to leave if I was going to keep nagging him. I was angry.  Shortly after, he started hallucinating. He said there were two children with big red noses smoking acid type stuff. He also said there is white powder all over the floor and yellow bugs all over it. But in my eyes, none of this is happening. He puts on his shoes and starts to walk out the door in his underwear thinking he's going to find his pants out there. After his intense hallucinations today, I called 911. I stood outside as the police, firemen and paramedics went inside. They later told me that they were in a dilly of a pickle; they asked him a bunch of questions and he was able to answer them correctly and coherently. They checked all his vitals and he seems fine. He wasn't happy with them being there but he cooperated. He denied seeing children smoking in the house, but did point out dead cockroaches on the floor (the cop said they were not actually there.) They said they weren't legally able to take him to the hospital or detain him; he was still able to take care of himself. They confirmed that he hasn't gone to a GP for 5 years and they think he really needs to see a doctor as there is definitely something wrong with him. The problem is, he won't go. He refuses help from anyone. So, until he hurts himself again or finally decides to go to a doctor, I can't do anything for him apparently. However... I am noticing interesting behaviours that make me think something is really going on here and I can't quite give up. He's my dad and I love him.  Scared about how he was going to react after the police/ambulance visit, I walked in to find him sleeping at the kitchen table. He later walked to bed and was in there for maybe 30 minutes, sleeping presumably. After his nap (I've never seen him nap before) he found 2 beers, drank them, and suddenly became a lot more normal. He was joking around and laughing like his old self. He even ate! All night long he didn't even mention the police or paramedics and it makes me wonder if he even remembers or if he can't tell what's real and what isn't anymore. He did have some minor hallucinations again; the boy who was smoking but he didn't spend too much time on it when I told him to ignore the boy. He eventually fell asleep in his chair, mumbling in his sleep as he usual does. Part of me thinks he's a better person when he has a couple beers and maybe when he drinks, it hides his true medical condition. Is there a diagnosis for what is going on? How can I help? My main worry is how my mom is going to work 7 days a week and be his caregiver since he really can't take care of himself anymore, despite what authorities say. He's constantly pant less because he can't put them on, can't do laundry, everything hurts to lift, etc... Ahh... help!! Thank you :) - Karoline","Depression , Substance Abuse"

(It cracks so much I've genuinely been asked if I just broke my neck) - In general, my knuckles, knees, elbows, shoulders, etc. are very stiff and will sometimes have dull pain until I manage to crack them  - Stiff and tense back  *Keep in mind, all of these issues are pretty minor and unfortunately normal for many of the people at my school due to backpacks and sitting at computers, etc.* In the past year I've been getting really strange sensations in both my wrists. Whether I'm lifting something really heavy or even going to high five someone, sometimes I'll feel this almost popping/snapping sensation (but unlike cracking ones knuckles purposefully) in my wrist and suddenly a strange pain will branch out up my hand. It almost feels as though I can feel the pain branching out from nerve to nerve. Then my hand and wrist will tingle/have pins and needles for a bit until I get normal feeling back. It doesn't happen every time I move my wrists but when it does it is an extremely strange feeling. Non-professionals have told me it may be carpal tunnel or a pinched nerve, but I'd like a second opinion before I decide whether to get it checked out.

I have been there. It took me 30 years to become pain free without drug or surgery. Solution is simple: inversion table. This many not work for everyone but worked for m. And I want to go to the mountain top and shout to the world: At least give it a try. It does not cost much ($100.00 --$300.00) and does not take much time – a few minutes every morning until you get cured.  Most of the chronic back pain is caused because the nerves going out of the spine is touched by something -- disc bulges, misaligned vertebrae or muscle. The solution is bringing your spine back to straight natural shape. The solution I found was an inversion table. All other physical activities keep squashing discs and vertebrae, which makes the misalignment permanent. Picture yourself hanging upside down by your ankle. This helps stretch out your back bones relieving pressures between bones and straightening your posture. You need to do 10 - 30 second early in the morning before your back pounding starts with sitting & walking.

The only thing that has seemed to help it when it comes is head to the fridge and chow down on food and snacks because it feels like my body needs something. And usually that will take care of it but lately it hasn't. I don't have any medical conditions and I haven't drank in over a week and it hit me last night bad so its not alcohol related i don't believe. I take a benadryl every now and then to help me sleep and haven't kept tabs on whether that may cause but last night I did take one and it hit after the benadryl wore off because it didn't put me to sleep. But it has happened without taking benadryl obviously just as frequent so not sure if thats it either. Any help or input or suggestions about this will be very welcome!,

Sometimes they will go on for over an hour, and she rarely gets anything done. She was eventually diagnosed with dyscalculia, panic disorder, and GAD. She saw a psychologist for a couple years and the psychologist felt that putting my daughter through a panic attack every night was not fair to her. Now my daughter is in 7th grade and her teachers are giving her D's because her homework isn't completed. My daughter has already voiced (many times, since she was 7 or 8) wanting to die/kill herself because the stress of school is so overwhelming for her. I don't know what I can do for her as she is too young for meds and felt that her previous therapy was completely unhelpful, which it was. The only way it helped her was by getting a Psychologist to talk to the school and help with her IEP. Her overall anxiety never decreased or was helped by the therapy. I don't know what to do or how I can help her but her current level of stress is unacceptable and the school doesn't seem to care.",Anxiety & Panic Disorders

(pinched nerve neck?),"Question: I was hoping to see if anyone else had an issue like mine. I can't find anywhere online where someone pinched a nerve in their neck without knowing how it happened. Could I have pinched a nerve in my neck without realizing it in my sleep? It also affects both sides. I have more details below but I just wanted to see if this seems likely or not. Details:  I am a 33 Year old male, 5'11"", Crohn's which is under control, I have benign fasciculation syndrome (15 years, symptoms come and go), I also was diagnosed two years ago with epilepsy but I only had one mild focal seizure when that happened, had an MRI, no issues in the brain at that time. Three weeks ago I woke up with left arm (bicep/tricep) numbness. The next day it was both arms. Over the next couple days it evolved into pain in both arms and in my neck. It wasn't the spine, it was more the back/sides and going into my shoulders. A few more days passed and the numbness was gone and it was all pain. Fast forward two weeks after it began and I saw a doctor who said it was a little uncommon for it to affect both arms.  She gave me prednisone and flexiril for 5 days which lessened the symptoms but after I stopped the prednisone, the pain was back. I am experiencing a on and off fatigue in my arms (bicep/triceps), not forearms. I have pain in the neck area and a pain between left shoulderblade and spine which feels like a muscle cramp that won't go away. I did get another 5 days of flexiril because it eases the pain in my neck.  I forgot to mention, I have had on and off 'perceived weakness' this whole time but I keep testing my strength and I am able to do as many push-ups as always, I have good balance but I do have the burning, fatigue feeling sometimes when I carry something. My doctor said I need to schedule another visit after the current Rx of flexiril is completed if I still have symptoms which I will but I am a bit of a worry wart. The thing is, I didn't have an 'incident' before this happened. I just woke up one day and this all began. Is it possible that I pinched a nerve in my neck while sleeping?","Neck Pain , Back Pain"

The throbbing for 3 days, sensitivity to everything that makes you want to cry out and scream and o ya the vomiting are my constant companion. When I'm not having Migraines, I'm having smaller irritating and uncomfortable headaches 3 to 4 times a week that I've just become accustom too. As I've gotten older I'v gained more triggers. Perfumes, nail polish, chewing gum to long, Cold air is a big one or the fan blowing air on me really gives me one fast. Chemicals, fresh cut flowers, alcohol the list goes on, anyway because of my Migraines theirs Alot of activities i cant do either like Concerts, every once in awhile i try one and yep always come home with a Migraine. Weddings to, Even when I'm a Bridesmaid i always end up with a Migraine, i guess its all the running around taking pictures outside then inside where the A/C is so FREAKING COLD, as soon as i feel it i know immediately I'm going to have another Migraine on another one of my Best Friends special nights. It happens so often I hope they don't think I just don't want to be their. Ironically in 2018 and 2017 I had a Migraine on one of my friends Birthday both years? Same friend? We were not meant to celebrate our 30th year together. I can't tube at the lake anymore, one round and Bam I'm done Instant migraine you can probably imagine my dismay I'm only 30. I've been to the Doctors I've got a Specialist and a Neurologist hey I've even got and amazing Chiropractor/Acupuncturist I like him best and i just had my first Daith done in my left ear which seems to help so far but ill get the other done in a month then we'll really see. So there's a little of my history for you. Now as much as i have Migraines theirs one thing I've always been able to take, one thing I've always loved, one thing that's never really bothered me and that's The Heat. I can work in it, swim in it, pick blackberry's in it, Garden in it, get sun burnt in it, bask in it, fish in it, clear a field by hand with a weed eater in it and I'll never get a Migraine. I drink a lot of water, i drink it all day and i pack it with me, and i sweat very little, or i guess i do sweat its just gotta get really hot for me to sweat like other people, usually when other people are sweating and turning on the a/c I'm still over here with my windows open, curled up on the couch in some sweat pants and having separation anxiety with my electric blanket. This is me cold natured, im never quite warm enough. Until last year anyway now I'm still cold and I still love all things warm but I can no longer work outside in the heat?? So I'm a 30 year old woman who now can't do the one thing left she had left that she loved. I don't feel sorry for myself that's life, now that I have more time to work outside in my yard It would figure It makes me Physically Ill to do so seeing as how it didn't make me physically i'll the 10 years before that but i didn't even have a yard then because i was too busy working 16 hours shifts. Now im finally at a place where life is slower for me, I can relax enjoy my yard, do some landscaping ect...... but my body wont let me, I was out side over the weekend for 3 hours in the heat of the day and its only around 82-82 here right now, plenty hydrated and by the time I got inside the pain was miserable, unbearable even, from 1130pm to 600am the next morning i vomited every hr to hr 1/2, this will happen every time i exert myself in the Sunlight i was hoping i was just under a lot of stress last year clear ground and putting in a new place and that's why i kept getting sick every time i went to work down their but now I've been working out in the yard this year and the same result. I did talk to my Nero Dr about it she checked my medicines and made sure they didn't have any side effects due to sunlight exposure ect..... and agreed that maybe it was just stress or my body and migraines are just changing and I'm just going to have to watch what i do. I'm really not her biggest fan as i don't think a perfectly healthy 30 year old woman should have to creep around my yard like I'm 75 or 80 and have an illness, their has to be a better way ???? I'm reaching out because i was hoping someone would have similar experiences and could help. Any advice would be appreciated",Migraines

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/47020/a-desperate-plea,A Desperate Plea,"Hello, my name is Alyxandrea, and I’d like to tell you my story and I would very much appreciate your patience and attention, because there’s a very important moral to my story that I believe you would find eye-opening.  I was born May 14th, 1990. I came into this world in the most horrific agony you could ever imagine. You see, when my mother was in labor, I was trapped, hooked around her pelvic bone and the cord was around my neck multiple times. They lost my heart beat, and at the time, the doctor did what he knew. He reached in and dislocated my right shoulder, prying me out, and then performing CPR. By some miracle I lived, but I couldn’t use my arm, and I screamed for months. The only thing in this bright world I knew was pain, from the very moment I came into it.  Eventually, through persistent physical therapy, I regained use of my right arm, though I was never able to straighten the elbow out. I was diagnosed with erb’s palsy as a result of being born with true shoulder dystocia, and thus my life began. My toddler years were unfortunate. I showed excessive clumsiness my entire life, though there was no idea why until I was an adult. I was relatively healthy and happy for many years, showing promising intelligence despite beginning my time in this world dead. These few, precious years, I will know as the only time in my life I was not in agony. Shortly after turning 10, I was in a bicycle accident that changed everything about me. I was always slightly off, but the accident introduced me once more to my first moments in the world. I flipped the bike going very fast down a hill. I remember the pavement coming up towards my head as my feet went straight up. I blacked out, and woke a few minutes later a good 10 feet from where I impacted, with my neck and upper back in the worst pain I had ever known. Being young and indestructible, my family didn’t think much of it, as I went back to playing not 2 hours later. Little could anyone predict that this was the accident that started it all. Suddenly, I began having these horrible pains in my back, spontaneously. I began suffering from migraines and almost daily headaches. Doctors simply gave me a few ibuprofen and sent me on my way. A few months down the road, while my mother was in the hospital with sepsis after having my brother, I was at the roller skating rink with my girl scout troop. I was having fun and participating in games, when I did the splits to show off. I’ve always been unusually flexible, so I wanted to impress my friends. I was rushed to the emergency room by my father after I started screaming and crying after doing it. In the E.R. I learned I had torn all of the ligaments around my kneecap and was put in a leg brace for nearly six months. My elementary school, being full of adults who didn’t know kids could be in pain, wouldn’t let me use the elevator, so I had to learn how to climb stairs in a leg brace.  Someday, my leg healed and I was back to being a kid again, with the exception of chronic back pain and now, occasional knee pain. When I was 16 I was diagnosed with arthritis in my knee, and sent to a chiropractor for my back, but it wasn’t helping. I began hurting more and more as the days turned to months and the months to years and no doctors cared. Eventually I was taking over 1800 mg of ibuprofen a day and my activity dropped substantially. My ankles began dislocating partially almost daily, and my knees both began suffering. I started twisting my good knee often, and falling down more and more. Still no one helped me. When I was 22 I had another accident. This one I refer to as the catalyst, because it threw my entire life into disarray. I was a groomer, and I loved my work. One day I was grooming a rather large australian shepherd, and went to lift him. When I did, I heard a loud pop in my right shoulder. I braced for the pain, but when it didn’t come, I felt relieved.  The next day I was unable to use my arm at all. It hurt so bad, and it felt hot to the touch. I saw an orthopedic doctor who told me to just not use it and wait a few months. I waited. Again I saw him and he put me in physical therapy. I went and within 10 minutes the physical therapist called my orthopedist and told him there was something structurally wrong, and I was being physically blocked by something because he could not move my arm. Half a year after my accident, they did a surgery on my shoulder. I had multiple bone spurs, one shaped like a hook that was cutting the muscle with every movement, and my collarbone had fractured and been held in place by the amount of swelling I had. When they opened my arm up, the collarbone was almost powder. They shaved it off and rotated my bursa, which was also inflamed. Then it was back to PT for another 6 months. My pain became intolerable, my right shoulder muscles atrophied, my left shoulder started to hurt, and all of the pain I’d had before was now even worse. I was suffering. Some time later I started fighting. I went to doctor after doctor after doctor searching for answers. I changed jobs, finding one I could do without using my arms too much. One where I could sit, because my back and my knees hurt so bad. I went to every doctor and did every test and every stupid procedure and holistic treatment they threw at me from meditation and acupuncture to neck injections. Eventually I found a few doctors who all had a small piece of the puzzle that were the answers to my problems. MRIs that showed nothing, labs, xrays, nerve conduction tests, all came up normal. Somehow, though, I was diagnosed with dystonia, fibromyalgia, and facet joint syndrome. Do you know what they did for treatments? Muscle relaxers, some nerve blocks, a few epidurals, almost an entire year of steroids (which gave me diabetes, thank you), and nerve ablation. Do you know what has worked? Nothing. After the nerve ablation I’m in even worse pain and now I struggle to use my hands. My neck is in more agony than my shoulders, which still also hurt, and my upper back is in so much pain I can barely stand it. My knees and my ankles dislocate almost daily, and I’m unable to do anything anymore. I can barely hold a fork. I’m now on actual pain medicine, thanks to my ablation, but they’re already trying to take that away, altering it to now be oxy and ibuprofen, putting more emphasis on going on ibuprofen, which has never helped ever since I was a child. I’ve been flagged by some as a drug seeker, an addict by others, and a hypochondriac by some more. “You’re too young to hurt so much” I hear. Yeah, I am, and yet here we are. I discovered a disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which would explain so much of my problems, including the famous clumsiness, but yet I cannot find a single doctor in over 300 miles to test me.  I have racked up over $80,000 in medical debt just trying to survive. I’ve been denied any actual procedures that could help, and no one will treat my pain properly. I’ve been suffering for almost my entire life, however short it’s been, and not one person has actually helped me. My pain specialist in Omaha, over 200 miles away, has been the only one to keep trying after every failure. He’s the only one who seems to genuinely believe me. The others have all given up after one or two attempts. I’ve had neurosurgeons and pain specialists and oncologists and rheumatologists and orthopedic surgeons and therapists and psychologists and even a stem cell doctor all shrug me off as either an addict or a lost cause, or my favorite, blaming my weight. (I weighed 98 pounds until I was 14, I was in pain long before I was heavy.) I keep grasping at every possible lead on someone who could do something. Someone who could help me, in any way. I don’t want to be on pain medicine, I don’t. I hate being drugged. I hate the feeling. Please believe me when I say I’ll try anything at all to feel better, yet the medicine is the only thing that makes me able to function so I can keep fighting to find someone who could possibly know how to help me. This has been my entire life for so long, an endless cycle of pain and hurting and doctors and helplessness and hopelessness and desperation for someone to help. I am going to be 28 in a month. I’m not even halfway through this life. There are millions of doctors and specialists in this world. Someone, surely, has the answers I need and the ability to fix me. Is it so much to ask to be able to go through the day without hurting? Is it so much to ask for someone to help? I have so much I want to do. I want to study radiology. I want to have children. I want to be someone more than just a pain sufferer. My body just hurts so much.  I’m hoping someone will read this story and find it in them to help me. I know someone out there has to have answers, or ideas, or options. Please help me, I have so much life I want to live.","Knee Pain , Chronic Pain , Headaches , Neck Pain , Physical Therapy , Medication , Migraines , Back Pain"

It has been getting steadily worse since November and now also occurs noticeably during the day. I have been taking 25mg of trazodone before bed but it's not really working anymore.

I have anxiety associated with my heart but I'm tired of being told this sensation is caused by anxiety alone. I exercise regularly, never have caffeine, and in my normal life I do not typically have any issue falling asleep.  I'm currently waiting to undergo a sleep study as well as wear a holter monitor as I'm concerned there may be an arrhythmia associated with/causing this.

I suffer from fear of loud music. More specifically loud music of neighbors, or from out side a window, etc. I'm ok with people talking outside (although that has taken me sometime to get used to and causes anxiety at times) Now, I know that noisy neighbors are a common source or annoyance and aggrevation for many people. But loud music from behind the walls produces a panic attack in me. I have been lucky and for the past few years have had very nice quiet neighbors. However, we now had two new neighbors who like to listen to loud music and it's starting to bring back my anxiety and depression. From the first moment the music starts I have rush of fear (sweating, heart racing, the whole bit) and the panic lasts the rest of the night . The next day I can think of nothing much else other than 'when I get home will the music be on again, what will I do if it is', all the time getting very anxious and depressed thinking about it. And when at home even if there is no music the very possibility of that sound ruins my concentration; I have panic attacks just thinking about it starting again. It feels like some impending danger. I cannot relax at home and its a really problem. Every little sound makes me jump because I think its the music starting. I feel like I am in a state of heightened alert and that is all I can think about. I even get up several times to check that it really is quiet outside. I recognize that my reaction is completely out of proportion with the situation but I cannot control my reaction. This fear of loud music has been a problem for years and makes living very difficult and stressful. I don't enjoy anything and find myself dreading being at home for fear of hearing the noise. I tend to take it as a personal attack and I know it's not. Does anyone else have this problem? I have read some on Misophonia...could I have this? Would therapy help...or is it something I just have to try to deal with on my own? At the end of my rope",Anxiety & Panic Disorders

It would take too long to describe all so will keep it to the so-called recent past. 8 years ago my Mom was diagnosed with colon cancer. I had moved her to my place from So. CA, USA to No. CA, USA. When she grew ill once she was out of the hospital (after a month, in which I sat bed side daily) I tried to take care of her at home. Even ended up sleeping with her, so I could hear her call for assistance if she needed it. I was sleeping ok, but naturally was tired from the stress. She passed, scared and in a convalescent home. I lost my home and had to live in an RV. Moved from an RV park due to close living and no privacy. When there at RV park, I started getting panic attacks at night which would wake me up. Sought out Psych. Doctor. Gave me buproprion and klonopin. The klonopin was taken when the panic attack would awake me nightly. I moved. sadly I ended up on an illegal pot farm with other tenants who abused heavy drugs and alcohol and fought physically at times. My land lady was a narcissist and would scream and be delusional and just plain mean. She hated I'm a vegan and generally a quiet, keep to myself person and would badger me. I could not move due to financial reasons, although I kept looking. One cannot live looking over one's should daily and avoiding or trying to, the harassment and yes, at time sexual advances from other tenants. Many tenants came and went due to the activity on property. (lucky them!) I lived with this for over 7 years and except for exactly 6 'windows' of normal sleep, I never had a restful nights sleep. Kept seeking out new doctors to help to no avail. After 7 1/2 years I finally got subsidized housing and it is far, far better than where I had been and I thought I would get better. I'm better in that I'm not being harassed and am beginning to make friends though I need much quiet time. BUT I still spend nights shaking and awaken very early and pace the floor, so I turn on TV and make my morning health shake (plant proteins/banana/blueberries) These activities ease the shaking but I'm so very tired of never getting quality sleep. No one seems to be able to help. I just got a new Doctor and had a blood panel done and will see him in a week or so. I don't want to go on more drugs.

I've always been known as the happy guy who is always positive. And for the most part that is true but lately it's all an act and it's very hard to maintain.

She was experiencing what I believe to be paranoid delusions. She thought someone was slandering me on the internet and when I had asked her to procure the evidence. She pulled up a gardening blog that was talking about potting soil. She thought me and her were going to get arrested or killed if we went outside, that there were people looking for us. She did not sleep for 3 nights in a row, had poverty of speech and a thousand yard stare at some points in time. She also had to sleep in my mothers bed she is 22 years old because she was so terrified. She eventually 'came back' but she was never the same, much more docile and quiet, its like someone had completely changed her demeanor after this episode.  The next six months were great, she was finishing school for her massage therapy certification. Still was not the affable, quick witted young woman I knew to be my sister. In june on the fifth, 2017- it happened again on a family vacation. I had ended up getting into an argument with my mom. The turmoil must have triggered something. She became at a loss of words, catatonic- barely spoke the whole trip and we were at disney land- at one point on a walk with her to the store around the corner from the hotel, she said ""I don't want anyone to get hurt"". Her facial expression was that of bewilderment, awe, almost fear written on her face. She had to sleep with my mom and could not sleep- was crying herself to sleep at night quietly (I had trouble sleeping as well, and heard her). She would also poke me to ensure I wasn't something she saw. When we all returned from the vacation, we hospitalized her for a week, after a week she returned home on a regimen of medication and the doctors diagnosed her with Bipolar? What I want to know is, when has bipolar EVER had characteristics of paranoid delusions of persecution?? I mean, seriously? She is now partying, and doing cocaine now with the wrong crowd, never comes home and when she does, she sleeps all day. When confronted about it she gets really defensive and says 'something is wrong with her circadian rhythms, (from what i understand coke binges leave people exhausted and tired for days at a time). Her complexion is pallid with circles under her eyes.  I am trying to get my mom on board for an intervention, because she does not view her 'budding' illness as something that is to be taken seriously, even though she was completely unable to engage anyone in conversation because she was too caught up in whatever was going on upstairs, nor sleep alone, and had very distinct paranoid delusions, on both episodes. I believe the doctors are misdiagnosing her, because although Bipolar and Schizophrenia do have 'delusions' and 'psychosis' aren't they two separate variants of each other? I just need advice because I am hating watching my sister slowly destroy herself and not take care of her illness- and basically take advantage of my mom.","Schizophrenia , Substance Abuse"

It was pretty scary but they did get me in to see the sleep specialist do a study and I now have a CPAP. I have had that for over a month but cant tell if it is working yet because of the pills I have to take to sleep.  I was prescribed hydroxyzine but the antihistamine was way too strong and I couldn't function even after cutting the pill down to a quarter. The same was true with trazodone. I would cut it down to a fourth of a pill and couldn't function the next day. But I didn't even sleep well with it. There's basically two or three of weeks of my life that I barely remember. It made for a hard holiday season.  I am finding melatonin and natural stuff is working but I still only sleep about an 45 minutes to an hour at a time and it take me 60 plus minutes to get to sleep and 30 minutes to go back to sleep between ""naps"".

The procedure was incredibly uncomfortable (I would never do it out-patient if I would've known the amount of pain I'd feel), the first week was terrible, and I am still experiencing excruciating facial pressure, particularly in my cheeks, which comes in waves. I have already switched ENTs since the ENT who did the procedure told me it was okay to have an 8-hour nosebleed on the day of the procedure (not just tinted with blood but blood literally running down my face like a sieve) and a 3-hour bleed a week later after he attempted to pull one of my scabs off (he was wrong and I lost enough blood that my hemoglobin level is now below-normal). My new ENT is great and wants to look more at my allergies (I am allergic to some molds) but I am curious if anyone else had this much pain following this procedure. She started me on a course of antibiotics today and I'm hoping it helps because I'm taking Tylenol every 4 hours and waking up in the middle of the night with incredible pain once it wears off. I use saline nasal spray four times a day, follow an anti-inflammatory diet, do acupressure, use steam/warm moist heat packs on my face, and use the neti pot when not suffering from nosebleeds. I had to stop Motrin/other NSAIDS because they were partly responsible for the severity of the nosebleeds I had post-op. I just keep reading hw people go back to work the next day and I am astounded.
