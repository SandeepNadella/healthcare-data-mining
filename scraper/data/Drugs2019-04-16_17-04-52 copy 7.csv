Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/ditropan-gerd-back-pain-2923183.html,"Ditropan, gerd, and back pain!?","So earlier this year, back in January I was diagnosed with GERD. For those who aren't familiar GERD stands for gastroesophagus reflux disease. It's basically when you eat foods high in acidity that cause severe heartburn, esophagus pain and acid coming back up into the throat. This pain for me was unbearable! I had it so bad that I went to 2 different emergency rooms, I didn't know what was wrong with me. I always have been able to eat pasta and such with no problem. The first hospital I went to said it was kidney related and sent me on my way. Two days later, the pain got way worse. I was bawling hysterically when it came time for bed. I had extreme heartburn for close to 2 weeks, severe upper back pain, pain when I breathed in and out in my chest, it hurt like heck to press on my sternum and my stomach was bloated and my rib cage was beyond sore. After running more tests at a different hospital it was discovered that I had a hiatial hernia as well as GERD. Since all this happened, I have been fine. I do eat very little pasta anymore as well as the other foods that can cause a flare up. Well, keeping all that in mind, I also have bladder issues. You know, urinating frequently, burning after urination, pelvic pain and so on. After going to my doctor's countless times for what I thought was a UTI (it wasn't), they finally referred me to a urologist. I just seen him the other day and he wanted to try medication first before doing anything invasive like a cystoscopy (camera in urethra). He put me on Ditropan which is supposed to control overactive bladder (OAB). I knew nothing about this drug other than the purpose of it so I have been taking it and even though it isn't helping with the burning it is helping with the constant need to go. Well, I had no idea people with GERD shouldn't take this drug. And my urologist never once questioned me taking it. I've only been on it for 2 days now and I am having severe upper back pain. If only you could see how i'm sitting to type this. Also, I have pain in my rib area that is sore to touch. I haven't felt this kind of pain in these locations since my flare up back in January. Is it possible Ditropan is causing this? Do I need to call my doctor and report this? Should I stop taking the Ditropan and see if the pain dies down? "

To finish my question, they are white, round with markings on one side 54 262 and a score mark in the middle on the other side.

This is my mistake, I realize. I just need to have about 20 more in my bottle than what I have so it doesn't look quite as bad. They are getting so difficult to work with with all the new rules coming into effect and they act as if our bodies are just going to get in line with the new rules with no side affect of doing so. I think they are really just trying to help but the pain is significantly worse than usual with the weather changing and all. I used bit more than I normally would have as I was used to taking the extended release instead of the instant release and breaking them down so I could step down slowly instead of jumping down quickly. In short, I need to put pills in my bottle that will match the description and I'm thinking of using a supplement like a vitamin C as I know those are white but they are generally quite big and I also have a mg weight scale so I can get them to scale too.

While I only used the drug for 2 days, as I suffered crippling stomach pain which caused me to collapse. After this I called my GP who told me NOT to take it again. During the two days I was using it, I also suffered violent nausea, but I was unable to vomit, I would just retch, hunger even after eating, but if I ate it felt like I'd eaten 50 hot shards of glass, my stomach would endlessly rumble even after eating and I passed wind through both ends NONE STOP. This was so embarrassing I was unable to leave the house at one point. The erythromycin also made me feel very depressed and low, I was unable to sleep and if I did, I would have very vivid dreams about death, dead bodies and rotting flesh, so nice when you already feel constantly sick. It is now July, I took this drug in December 2009, and I am still suffering some of these effects. Some days I feel very sick for no reason, or feel sick with some cramping after meals. I suffer from terrible trapped wind, which results in embarrasment once it becomes untrapped. I suffer flatulence so bad you'd think I was a big fat man living off cheeseburgers, or had consumed copious amounts of baked beans topped off with chilli & onions. I can do it none stop, specialy after eating, and if I don't 'let it out' it builds up & causes me splitting cramps in my abdomen, which often cause me to cry out. This drug has ruined my body and my life, nothing I try seems to quell the continuing effects of it. I am getting married next month and I would be mortified if I was hit with an attack of flatulence at the altar. What do I do? I'll be eating after at the reception, and as soon as I have a meal, I start blowing off like a whale in a brass band, sorry it sounds funny, but really, it isn't. I have to avoid anything 'farty' like eggs, beans, onions, hot & spicy foods, if curry etc. This does not stop my problems, but it lessens their effects to a degree.  I'm doing everything I can to help my stomach get back to normal, including drinking a probiotic, and avoiding carbonated drinks etc. However, this problem is really getting me down, I am also suffering from diarrhea, and frequent stomach upsets following using this drug.

Then almost 2 weeks later they called asking him to come in because he had an usual pill count (exact words the nurse used and he's never had a pill count in all the years he's been seeing this doctor) which isn't a problem, except for one thing, he's been having flu like symptoms. And the doctor's office has a policy requiring patient to not come to the office if sick with these symptoms, but to call and reschedule appointment. And with this knowledge my husband informed his doctor's nurse that he was sick and asked if he could come in with his medicines a few (like 2) days later.

I noticed I had been clenching my teeth a lot and chalked it up to that. I called about 6 dentists that are ""in network"" for my dental insurance. A couple were over an hour away. No one could see me until next Thursday at the earliest. I found a dentist (not covered by ins) that can see me Monday.  The pain i feel is moderate to low-severe. It's generally located in the upper right, with one tooth that seems to take the brunt of it. That tooth feels like it is taller/longer than its neighbors. I also have a pretty good/bad cross bite on that side.  It's worse upon waking and will subside for a few hours with two ibuprofens. I have little to no gum pain. On ibuprofen, it aches slightly in the back and a little around my incisors. Warm compresses help sporadically. When it aches the most I also feel a bit of pressure under the bone next to my nose. I took one Percocet last night, but it took much longer to relieve the pain than the ibuprofen.  I have self diagnosed myself to death. I guess my question is, with this myriad of symptoms - does it sound like an abscess? TMD/J? Sinus Infection?  Thanks :) "

Panic Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/how-does-klonopin-make-you-feel-483875.html,How does klonopin make you feel?,"I was just prescribed 1mg clonazepam twice a day by my doctor. I was prescribed this over a year ago but I have pretty much no tolerance I guess. At first I was on xanax 0.5 PRN for a few weeks and now I'm taking 1mg klonopin twice a day.  I have a question though. I'm of course not wanting to get high on my medication, but do you ""feel"" when your medication kicks in? I can say that it lasts a long time and I haven't had any panic or anxiety episodes since I started taking it a week ago, but I don't feel that wave of relief that xanax provides (which I didn't like because it makes it way to habit-forming). Now, I take my 1mg twice a day, and I never feel much sedation or that loose feeling like I did on 1mg xanax for example, but instead I just don't get the anxiety in the first place. It seems that for me the klonopin is preventative for my panic and anxiety rather than acting as a med that leaves me feeling sedated and such, thus relieving anxiety. The first half tablet (0.5mg) klonopin I took last Monday, an hour later I felt sleepy, good, and my muscles were so relaxed and I went and took a great nap. Now, I'm taking 4 times that amount in a day and experience nothing of the sort, but I almost don't want to. My point is that even though I still have basically no tolerance, I feel nothing when I take a 1mg clonazepam, other than the fact that my anxiety doesn't surface as usual.  My question: What do you feel or how do you feel after your klonopin dose(s) every day? Is my experience pretty normal? "

I don't have an official diagnosis like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder; in fact my Dr and I differ greatly when it comes to what we think is wrong with me. My father, whom I was very close to, passed away suddenly last November. Up until that point, I was great. In a wonderful relationship, had lost 90 lbs after leaving my terribly abusive ex husband 2 years prior, loved my job, had a social life. Then my father died of a massive heart attack November 2011 and it's like the grief is winning. My Dr thinks I am bi-polar; I think I have situational depression and anxiety. I have been taking .5mgs Xanax 4 times daily, and 300mgs Neurontin just before bedtime. These help tremendously with my anxiety and sleep, as long as I keep taking them. I have issues with my mood (mainly I am just sad or irritable) and confidence, and that's why the Dr wanted me to try Latuda. I am supposed to take 20mgs a day 2 hours after eating but 2 hours before I go to bed, so right in the middle. I am truthfully terrified to take this medication because of the side effects, and I am wondering if any of you Latuda users out there might be able to help. Should I give it a shot? I read all the users' comments and am just terrified my anxiety and panic attacks are going to skyrocket, and my sleep has been much better with the Neurontin.

Pregnancy,https://www.drugs.com/answers/girls-worrying-pregnancy-read-1256466.html,Girls worrying about pregnancy please read?,"Judging by the questions we've had this morning, this is needed.  For All You Girls with Birth Control and Pregnancy Questions 1. Bleeding is NOT a sign of pregnancy. 2. You need penetration to get pregnant. 3. Any penetration with a naked penis can make you pregnant, it doesn't matter how long, how far in, or if he ejaculated. 4. You have to wait 7 days before having unprotected sex with new birth control. 5. Bleeding is NOT a sign of pregnancy. 6. If you are on birth control and taking it correctly you are safe all the time. You have less then a 1% chance of pregnancy.  7. You don't need a condom to prevent pregnancy when you're on hormonal birth control, therefore you do NOT need to take plan B or any of those meds, if one breaks.  8. You can't use Plan B or any emergency contraceptive on a regular basis, it isn't meant for birth control, its for emergencies. It isn't as effective as regular birth control and it will mess up your cycle.  9. Bleeding is NOT a sign of pregnancy. 10. If you are on birth control and the dr puts you on an antibiotic you need to use a condom for the time you're on it and a week after it stops.  11. The apps that predict ovulation are only telling average believe it or not, only about 30% of women are average. We don't even ovulate at the same time every month, so using it for birth control is foolish. 12. When you're on the birth control pill, it controls your period, so the apps that track it are useless, don't let them confuse you.  13. Bleeding is NOT a sign of pregnancy.  14. We can't tell you if you're pregnant. We can tell you if there is a chance of it.  15. Emergency contraceptives don't work for sex after you take it.  16. To avoid false negatives, wait until your period is a week late to do a pregnancy test. Do the test first thing in the morning.  17. Bleeding is NOT a sign of pregnancy. 18. If your question is about a birth control pill we need to know what you're on and what week you're in.  19. When you start birth control pills you start with the color that has the most pills.  20. You need to read the directions before you start birth control pills.  21. You can't take your birth control pills any way you want. They come in order for a reason. They are made to work with your cycle, and if you stop them early to get your period, so you won't have it when it would be due, it won't work, all it will do is leave you open to pregnancy because you aren't on the active pill when you should be.  22. Bleeding is NOT a sign of pregnancy 23. There is no way to tell you if the emergency contraceptive worked or not.  24. Think before you act. It will avoid you being here begging for help after the fact, because you think you're pregnant.  25. Morning after pills or emergency contraceptives are not magic. They do not end a pregnancy in progress. They do not work if you've already ovulated. And they are less effective then regular birth control.  26. Early signs of pregnancy include lack of a period and nausea. They do not include back pain, stomach pain, headaches, bleeding other then your period. They also do not start immediately after sex.  27. Bleeding is NOT a sign of pregnancy. 28. Misoprostal isn't as safe or effective as you think. It only works 40% of the time, and when it doesn't, it can cause infection and bleeding for you and serious damage to the baby, so you should not take it without a dr taking care of you.  29. You DO NOT ovulate when you're on the pill, so get rid of those apps.  30. The correct term is ejaculated, it is not cum, jizz, or anything else you can think of. Please use it. "

I had major problems I thought I was going insane and was ready to voluntarily commit myself to the psychiatric ward at the hospital I was taking 320mg of Geodone then to. The reason I was put back on the Geodon is that my sister is taking it and doing good I thought I was doing something wrong it did give me more energy and I thought it helped me think more clearly I now know I was wrong. I was misdiagnosed from the start first with bipolar disorder then with schizoaffective disorder my new psychiatrist diognosed me as having Anxiety disorder. I think the Geodon really screwed me up big time now I am trying to get off the stuff as safely as possible. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I am also taking: Clonazepam 4mg (stopped working after 2 years) Lithium 1200mg (planning on weening off it) Thanks 
Schizophrenia,https://www.drugs.com/answers/latuda-symptoms-depression-related-3460326.html,Can Latuda also help symptoms of depression related to schizoaffective disorder?,"I was just prescribed 40mg Latuda nine days ago, to be taken once in the evening with food. I have schizoaffective disorder depressive type. The symptoms started showing relatively early, when I was twelve years old. My hallucinations are mostly limited to hearing voices that cause unreasonable paranoia of trusted friends and family as well as strangers, and it is coupled with depressive symptoms. It also creates/worsens my insomnia because the voices get much ""louder"" at night, and when the insomnia gets severe I do experience mild visual hallicinations in the form of moving shadows. I also frequently wonder over existential problems, such as if I'm in control of my own thoughts/actions or if anyone truly has free will, which is likely another form of hallicinative symptom. I also have PTSD from abuse and entrapmentthat developed in my late teens to early twenties, and have had generalized anxiety disorder with leanings toward severe social anxiety since I was seven years old. I'm currently twenty-six and didn't see a mental health professional until this year in June. My depression worsens seasonally (I'm typically at my best in the whole of spring and late-autumn to early-winter, and at my worse in mid- to late-winter and the whole of summer). The Latuda has already done wonders for my auditory hallicinations and therefore also my paranoia, anxiety, and insomnia. I'm new to taking medication for my issues on the whole. I took Seroquel for two months before I was switched to Latuda; Seroquel made me emotionally numb. That has gone away with Latuda, but my depression is persisting and worsening, which as I stated is common this time of year. It's always there, but it's at its worst this time of year in particular. My question is, then, since Latuda is typically prescribed for schizophrenia and bi-polar depression, can it also help the depressive symptoms associated with schizoaffective disorder? It hasn't yet, but I've barely been taking it a week and a half. If the depression persists, should I talk to my doctor about switching to a different medication or adding a medication for depression? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "

Pregnancy,https://www.drugs.com/answers/girls-think-pregnant-read-716527.html,For all girls who think they may be pregnant: Please Read!," It doesn't matter what your story is, when you had your period, how many times you had sex, if he did or didn't ejaculate, cum (or nut), if you're on birth control, whether or not the condom broke, or anything. You always have a chance of being pregnant, and that's exactly what we're going to tell you. So before you post, test! You can test 4 days before your first missed period, better yet, a week after your period is late so don't ask us your chances of being pregnant, just test!!  Read more:  If you are on birth icontrol pills and at any time you need to take antibiotcs, antibiotics can reduce the effectiveness of birth control pills so you need to use back up BARRIER protection, like condoms, for the entire time you are taking the antibiotics AND for at least 7 days after you finish them. Since antibiotics reduce the effectiveness of the Pill, you CAN become pregnant when taking antibiotics while on the Pill if you do not use a barrier back up method. I say barrier method because ""pulling out"" or removing the penis before ejaculation is NOT effective as a method of birth control and neither is it a back up method, also, I dont recommend the use of emergency contraceptives (Plan b, Next Choice) when you are on hormonal birth control already (birth control pills, Depo-Provera, Nuva Ring, Ortho Evra are examples of hormonal birth control methods). Read more:  Plan b or other emergency contraceptives are a big blast of hormones and when you are already on hormones, this becomes a hot mess of circulating hormones in your system. It is not contraindicated to use Plan b when on oral contraceptives that I know of, BUT by taking these large doses of hormones, you are opening yourself up for major side effects from these hormones. Things like sore, tender, swollen breasts, nausea, vomiting, cramping, bloating, acne, dizziness, headaches, lack of appetite or increased appetite are all side effects of large doses of hormones found in birth control. Sounds a lot like pregnancy, doesnt it? So if you are using Plan b (or other emergency contraceptive) because of a missed pill or as ""back up"", it is not going to save you any stress to have delayed periods (most women experience delayed periods or irregular bleeding after using Plan b or other emergency contraceptives) along with the symptoms listed above!!  You will be terrified you are pregnant so do yourself a favor and use condoms for back up when needed rather than emergency contraceptives. It is always, always better to PREVENT pregnancy than trying to fix things after the fact!  Another issue comes to mind. DO NOT tell yourself at any time that it is okay to have unprotected sex because you can just take Plan b or Next Choice, or any emergency contraceptives, after - no ""heat of the moment"" BS - you are in control of your body and ""heat of the moment"" is just another way of saying ""I'm just lazy about protecting myself""!! It is always, always better to PREVENT pregnancy.  Prevention is MUCH more effective than taking an emergency contraceptive after the fact! Emergency contraceptives are a great tool to use in our contraceptive arsenal available to today's woman, but they should be reserved for TRUE emergency use, meaning a slipped or broken condom, a dislodged diaphragm etc. It could be used for a missed pill, but as I say above, you are better off using condoms because the added blast of hormones is going to delay your period and make you feel pregnant because of the side effects and believe me-it will shoot your anxiety levels through the roof.  If you must use emergency contraceptives, keep this in mind and expect the delay in your cycle. Women will often have a bleeding episode, like a period, after about a week after taking emergency contraceptives (but not ALL women have this bleed and it is no indication of whether it worked or didnt work) and the next period due is almost always delayed or bleeding may be irregular-you may spot several times or not bleed at all for a couple of months. Every woman is very different so it is hard to say what is ""normal"" as all of these scenarios are normal. If you take emergency contraceptives and your period is late and it has been at least a month since your unprotected sex event, you can go ahead and test for pregnancy. If you test any sooner, it is likely too soon and it will not be accurate. If it is negative, it is likely to be the hormones delaying your cycle. Wait another month, if still no period, see your gynecologist to rule out pregnancy.  DO NOT use emergency contraceptives as a contraceptive. They really shouldn't be taken very often and they do NOT ""cover you for a few days"" - you return to fertility quickly so if you took an emergency contraceptive one day, dont expect it to protect you the next day - it doesnt work like that. A regular, reliable method of birth control such as oral contraceptives (birth control pills or the Pill), Depo-Provera, an IUD like Mirena, or an implant like Norplant or Implanon, or Nuva Ring or Ortho Evra (the Patch) are much better for your system and MUCH more effective than emergency contraceptives.  Read more:  More women should look into long term birth control solutions like IUD's or implants like Implanon or Norplant. These are effective for 3-5 years depending on which method you choose and they dont require you to take a daily pill or remember anything other than the time that they need to be replaced, so what could be more convenient?  Not all methods are for everybody so be sure that you research the method(s) you are interested in then go talk to your women's health care professional and ask any questions and then decide, with their help, which method will work the best for you in your individual situation. We are SO blessed in the time we live in that we have so many options available to us. There is really little excuse NOT to use some method of birth control. It is readily available in so many different places, convenience stores, grocery stores, gas stations, doctors offices, family planning clinics and depending on where you go, much of it is low cost or no cost if you are a student or low income or uninsured. NO EXCUSES!!! Protect yourself and have babies when you WANT to have babies!! It is up to YOU to take control and advocate for yourself and plan your life. See also:  The average menstrual cycle is 28-days – that is counting Day one as the first day of menstrual bleeding(your period), then the next period is due to start 28 days later. Ones period comes because an egg fails to get fertilized. Ones period comes about 12 to 14 days after the egg is produced. Therefore, in the average 28 day cycle, the egg is produced around day 14. Sperms can live happily 32-48 hours in the vagina or the uterus, so the most fertile time is day 12 to day 16. These are the days that you want to be sexually active. You can also check your cervical mucus but this takes a bit of talent, observation and being familiar with your body. The least likely time to conceive is from day one to day seven. If your cycle is different from 28 days on average, you have to adjust the calculations – the important thing to remember is that the egg is produced about 14 days before the next period starts. So there's always a bit of guess work involved. Hope this information is helpful. Please refer back whenever you think you may be pregnant! "

Hot Flashes,https://www.drugs.com/answers/anyone-intestinal-bleeding-along-heavy-periods-655266.html,Has anyone had intestinal bleeding along with heavy periods on Pristiq?,Here is my story. I switched to Pristiq Aug 2012 after being on Prozac which seemed to stopped helping me with depression. Two months later I developed a severe large intestine bleed accompanied with severe pain. After a CT which found inflammation I was put on Flagyl and Cipro. I developed diarrhea and was gettting worse instead of better after 4 days and was hospitalized. A cdiff culture came back positive which was probably non active until I was put on the antibiotics. (was on effexor not Pristiq in hospital) I was released and sent home (back on Pristiq). Three days later the bleeding started again and I was put back in the hospital. Cdiff negative this time. A colonoscopy showed non specific inflammation (no polyps etc.). (on effexor) Relased again and on flagyl for 10 more days. When the flagyl ran out I started bleeding again. Tried increasing fiber but was getting sicker by the day. Called doctor put on Vancomycin. The theory at the time that it was an unusual presentation of cdiff (bleeding). On Vanc I felt a lot better and the bleeding stopped. When I was down to the last of the Vanc the bleeding started again and my general health deteriorated. Dr. put me back on Vanc and did colonoscopy and found the inflammation but no cause and recommendation was to discontinue vanc and if symptoms persist resect 5 inches of my colon. I did research and found Pristiq has rare bleeding as a side effect. Called Pfizer and 1 in 3000 had a bleed in clinical trials but could not get after market data as I am not a health care professional. It was over the holiday's so doctors were out and I decided to go cold turkey off Pristiq (not fun!) to see if it was causing the bleeding. The bleeding has stopped but I am concerned about what damage there may be to my colon and other organs. The last three months before I stopped taking Pristiq my periods were worse than they had been in my life. After stopping Pristiq my period was 20 days late but lighter than it had been while I was taking Pristiq. I am wondering if anyone else has had bleeding problems with Pristiq. I found one other person but tragically she died in a traffic accident a week ago before I was able to talk to her. From what I understand she had part of her colon removed. I've been bleeding off and on since October. Any insights appreciated.

I get hives on my stomach AFTER showering and getting sweaty, but the thing is when I shower, I don't get them in the shower, but only after it. I get them only on my stomach, and I also get them while I'm cutting the grass, since I get sweaty, and while swimming. I went to the doctor, and he said that it's probably from my body temperature rapidly changing, but I'm not 100% sure. He said not to worry about it, however it looks really bad, and now I have to swim in a water shirt. Plus, school starts in a month and we have swimming this year, and you're only required to wear trunks, so I don't want people to see all of the hives on my stomach and make fun of me. I was recently on a trip to the beach, and when I first got in and out of the ocean everyday, I got them, but after getting in and out multiple times over the course of a day, they went away. And the hives are really itchy and uncomfortable. I really don't think this is a water allergy, but I'm not 100% sure. But please, can someone help me, and tell me what I can do to stop this. I want these gone by when school starts. Thank you very much! "

Infections,https://www.drugs.com/answers/add-medications-adderall-exacerbate-fungal-2675541.html,Can ADD medications like Adderall exacerbate fungal infections?,"i started taking Adderall for AADD nine months ago. I broke out in lesions on my scrotum and arms. My right arm swelled and my shoulder became very painful. I went to my Doctor who said it wasn't a drug allergy and She didn't know what it was. Several months latter I went to see he again, extremely ill. I was debilitated, having severe muscle spasms in my hands, feet and legs. I had severe kidney impairment and my right eye was nearly swollen shut. She now told me that this was caused by my diabetes, which has always been under control and my A1C is always normal or close to it. Next. I developed a very thick gluey Coat on my tongue. Finally, I realized that these were symptoms of fungal infection. I went to see her with this idea. She told me that my tongue looked normal to her but she gave me a 7 day course of fluconazole. Thing began to improve immediately but not completely. I returned just before the Fluconazole ran out and told her what was happening. I thought it obvious that all of this was caused by fungal infection. After explaining to her my theory she once again told me that my tongue looked fine but gave my more Fluconazole and referred me, at my request to an infectious disease specialist. That day I went to my ADD prescriber and told her my theory. She thought we should change medications so I started on Vyanase. The infection which was almost gone came back with a vengeance. Fortunately, I had the new Fluconazole prescription, and things are steadily improving after I switched back to Adderall. I do realize that these medications do not cause the fungal infection but rather seem to change the body's PH and delicate flora balance. This is why I'm following up with the Infectious Disease Specialist. I haven't been well for years with a variety of symptom. I have read studies which indicate Amphetamines cause fungal infections in rats and yeast infections in Women. Has anyone else has a similar experience or know anything that could shed light on this process? "

I do not have a sinus infection but i am blowing my nose regularly to try to coax the fluid out.  My doctor prescribed amox, codine (for the extreme pain that the infection is causing), and ciprodex. Is there any other way for the fluid to be drained from my ear so I don't feel so clogged?

Emotional stress?,"During the last week of November I started feeling nauseated and bloated. It wasn't all of the time and it would get worse if I was stressed. It was almost finals week so I thought I was the stress that was making me sick. Right after finals I started to suspect my boyfriend of cheating on me so I was still stressed. It turns out he was and dumped me a few days after Christmas. When I went back down to school just after the New Year, I thought maybe all of the emotional stress was making me sick. I never felt like eating and when I did I would often throw it up. I lost about 15 lbs bringing my weight down to 108 lbs for a 5' 4"", 18-year old girl. It wasn't until mid-January that I got it checked out and they said I had bacteria called H pylori. With no insurance I spent $230 on three prescriptions that I took twice a day for two weeks. I had hoped that I would finally feel better after the treatment but I didn't. I felt even worse the next week. I was throwing up every little thing I ate. I couldn’t even hold down a couple of spoonfuls of yogurt. When the nausea would get better it seems I would feel more pain in my stomach. Since then I have still felt really sick. I would throw up 6-8 times a day. The doctor said I couldn’t get tested to see if the bacteria is gone until four weeks after the treatment has ended. I have been trying really hard to be happy and cheerful again but it makes it really hard when I am sick all of the time. I really just want to feel better. I am really tired of feeling nauseated and being afraid to eat because I know I might throw it up. I have also been really depressed. I don’t know if this has anything to do with H pylori. My roommates have been jerks to me lately and not understanding at all because I have been sick for so long. I am falling behind on schoolwork because I have had to miss so much class. I am really stressed and depressed, the only thing that has managed to cheer me up is when I feel well enough to go to church. Is this all normal? Is there some kind of association with emotional wellness and H pylori? When will I get better? "

I took it and within hours I felt less irritated down there. My vagina is still sore and a little swollen, though. My boyfriend was coming into town this weekend and I wasn't sure whether or not I could have sex while currently treating a yeast infection, so I looked it up and found that there was a 15% chance of a man catching a penile yeast infection during intercourse. The only real warning I saw was that it might be painful or more uncomfortable to have sex while with a yeast infection. My boyfriend didn't seem bothered by the percent chance and yesterday night we ended up having unprotected sex (I know, this was stupid). The internet was right, the sex was painful, but what I'm worried about now is whether or not I could have re-infected myself with my own yeast infection. I performed oral sex a while after penetration and I know there is a chance yeast infections can be transmitted orally but I wanted to know if it's possible to have ""cancelled out"" all the good that the Diflucan was doing by engaging in oral activities on a penis that had recently penetrated a yeast infected vagina.

Infections,https://www.drugs.com/answers/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-751947.html,Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Infection - My son contracted MRSA several years ago?,"... while living on the big Island in Hawaii. When he came back to the mainland, he and his then fiancé lived with my husband and me for about a year. We had separate bathrooms and aside from a daily hug, we did not have much physical contact. Somehow, however, I caught the MRSA from my son. It started as a tiny pimple-like sore at the entrance to my nasal passages, just above my lip. At first, I thought it was a pimple and I put toothpaste on it at bedtime in an attempt to dry up the pimple. That turned out to be a very bad idea, and it was very painful the next day and for several days after. I was able to continue going to work and doing my job, but I was continually complaining about having this little tiny pimple (that hurt) at my age. At the end of my workday on about the third day, one of my coworkers was standing above me at the printer and looking down at me. She asked me if I knew that my nose and lip were swollen, which I did not! I began to call my doctors office immediately, but kept getting a voicemail for some reason. I got off work about an hour later and continued to call my doctors office on my way home. When I arrived home, I showed my husband the swelling on my face and he said I should go immediately to the doctors office, which I did. My doctors office finally called me back when I was on my way there and told me to come in. Of course I said I'll be there in 10 minutes because I'm already on my way. The doctor gave me a prescription for some sort of antibiotic, but after several days it was not working in fact the store was getting more painful and the swelling worse. On Friday, which is about four days from the beginning of the whole thing, my husband had an appointment for a colonoscopy, which had been scheduled months in advance. We had both taken vacation days, so I was not willing to go to the emergency room for myself until he was taken care of. On that day, my face was so swollen that I looked like some sort of monster! On the way to the hospital where my husband was getting his colonoscopy, I was practicing pulling my lip in so I didn't look so horrible because I didn't want to scare the other patients. I made it through the day; however, I almost fainted when they showed me the pictures of my husband's colonoscopy results. I nearly asked him to move over and let me lay down next to him in the recovery room! I took my husband home, and we slept that night, but woke up early the next morning and my face was swollen worse than ever! My husband took me to the emergency room, and I was immediately admitted. The doctor immediately diagnosed me with MRSA and put me on an IV of the most powerful antibiotic (I think it was Versed). I spent about six days in the hospital in isolation (a beautiful private room with a view of Newport Harbor). Too bad I was too sick to enjoy it! On my last day in the hospital, gave to me to procedure room and opened and drained the sore in my nose. Even though I was on powerful pain meds, it hurt like hell! They sent me home with orders to stay in bed for another two or three weeks, while taking what I think was Bactrim (on a very very high dose) for the next couple of weeks. I was so sick I thought I might die, and I remained in bed the entire time. It turned out to be a blessing that my husband had been laid off from his job and was able to stay home and nurse me back to health! (Isn't it funny how these things happen?) Because I had very good insurance health insurance and my son had no insurance, he was not able to get the excellent medical treatment that I obtained. I was admitted to Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, which is a wonderful hospital where I have been to the ER on many occasions! The doctor was amazing and very knowledgeable! Whereas, my son had been treated numerous times at public health clinics both in Hawaii and here in California. His infections had been on his knee, and the sore that he would get was huge, filled with pus, and terribly painful, yet all they would do was give him a regular antibiotic which would merely treat the symptoms temporarily. The specialist I had been assigned through my insurance was nice enough to treat my son and his fiancé through me, and then my son would give their doctor at the health clinic the instructions my doctor had given me to relay. Evidently, my son's doctor was giving his fiancé and him a very low dose of Bactrim, while I was on a huge dose, even though my son is taller and weighs more than me. My doctor had instructed in the beginning that everyone in my household be tested for MRSA. (My son and his fiancée tested positive, while my husband tested negative.) This all happened about 10 years ago. At that time, I was told that I would always test positive for MRSA. I thought that that meant I was a carrier as well, but I'm not sure about that. I'm sharing my experience in the event that possibly someone could be helped by reading this. If I had put off going to the ER any longer, I just might have died! "

One day, while at work, several times I peed, it as like I was peeing coca cola and it was thicker than normal pee. By the evening it cleared up somewhat. about once every couple of weeks since then, my pee is kind of pink and darker.

Infections,https://www.drugs.com/answers/bronchitis-staph-infection-parasites-2838332.html,"Do I have bronchitis, a staph infection, parasites, or something else?","Hi, my name is Kate. For the past two years I have had foliculitis on my arms. It was at the point where there were scabbed over wounds for a long time. Starting about six moths ago I started to notice decreases in my health. I got sick about once every three weeks through out the year and one of these times I was hospitalized for severe vomiting. The doctors told me that that had been cause by a stomach flu that was going around at the time. About five months ago I started to notice severe ongoing pain in my lower left rib cage. I haven't been able to put a lot of pressure on my left rib cage since. Shortly after that I woke up in the middle of the night while having my first ever panic attack. A few weeks after that the pain in my left rib was very severe and there was a popping feeling and it went back to the normal persistent pain. I went to a doctor after that and he told me that I had an inflamed rib cage. After that incident I had no notable medical issues for a while, although my rib pain gradually increased, I had heart palpitations, my lymph nodes swelled, the skin on my feet started peeling off and I was very low on energy. A few days ago I stood up and suddenly was very nauseous, it also was very hard for me to breath and my left rib cage was very painful. The next morning the same thing happened again and again the next night. I went to a doctor and he diagnosed me with bronchitis and I showed him my staph and he put me on z pack. I am fairly certain that I don't have bronchitis because I didn't really have a chest cold at all. I am wondering if it does sound like I have bronchitis or if maybe my staph infection has spread. I am also wondering if I could have parasites or something else. Please let me know what you think is going on with me, I am very frustrated and it seems that every doctor I have seen is only focused on curing my immediate symptoms. I had many blood tests etc. at the hospital and they all came back ok, that was also six months ago. "

I was eating dinner with my family and all of a sudden I got a weird pressure in my ears and temples and felt like my head was spinning and I just felt like I was floating and my legs and arms became a little numb. Ever since then I've been traumatized and have developed some anxiety-- mainly because of that event and also because I am moving for college for the first time and am a bit stressed about the move away from home as well as stressed about feeling this dizzy feeling again ALONE. Ever since that night I have noticed that when taking my .50 dosage of synthroid in the morning I am okay all day until around 7 at night when the medicine I suppose starts to wear off. Could this mean that I am getting the dizziness because of a low hormone level and that I should up the dosage to the entire pill instead of half? I know the anxiety does not help either but I am hoping the low dosage is the MAIN problem? I am seeing my doctor in 2 days in which I will talk to her about all of this(Wednesday).

Hypothyroidism,https://www.drugs.com/answers/hypothyroidism-hypothyroid-patient-treated-nature-3395651.html,Hypothyroidism - I am a hypothyroid patient who has been treated with Nature-Throid for years....,"... until recently. My doctor quit her practice and around the same time, RLC Labs, manufacturer of Nature-Throid, stopped producing their product in varying doses. The dose I was prescribed is no longer available. They have taken all doses off the market, but plan to re-introduce it only in the 1 Grain tablets initially, followed by 1/2 Grain tablets. I would have to get a new doctor and also a new prescription for a different dose than the one I was on for years.  I chose this time to try getting away from taking thyroid hormone and treat it with other methods. I am trying the natural desiccated thyroid supplements that contain natural glandular products, along with iodine drops (lugol's solution 2%), increasing the dosage in increments to reach the therapeutic dose for efficacy.  I have run into a problem at this point - I am literally putting on weight at a rate of 1 or 2 pounds a day or every other day. I don't know if this was supposed to be part of the process, but I am becoming miserable. I look so bloated that I am beginning to almost look pregnant! I am wondering if this will start to subside as time progresses and my body detoxifies.  At this point, I am questioning if this is something I want to continue to pursue. I am starting to lean towards getting a new doctor and start back on Nature-Throid again. As I already stated, the dose I was on is no longer available.  But I am starting to feel unwell. Has anyone else had a similar experience to share with me? I cannot tolerate this weight gain and bloated feeling. My face looks swollen and puffy. My stomach is upset. I can't eat much, but when I step on the scales, I continue to gain daily. I was wondering if this is just a temporary reaction to detoxifying. I do not like the Lugol's solution drops. It tastes awful ! "

This happened three years ago with the same operation, and from memory I bled (again only slightly) for at least a month. As I am seeking to avoid infection, my wife suggested to keep myself hygenic and to avoid infection that I use a pantyliner, as using an incontinence pad is a vast overkill, bulky and more costly. I refused stating to her that the pantyliner is too narrow. Although my boxers have an opening at the front in the position where I would place a pantyliner, I could use men's trunk briefs (with no fly opening), which are similar to women's briefs. She countered the narrow issue by saying that the night-time sanitary napkins/panty liners are much wider, and have a extra wider part which goes at the front of the underwear in the position where my staining appears. She also suggested for the short period I am leaking blood, that I wear her panties, to save buying new underwear (which will fit as she made me try them on!). I am reluctant to do this (It seems very girly to my male pride) What does anyone think? I am concerned mainly with the pantyliner aspect. Decker Carter. "

I could barley do 16 days and my condition is better ! I'm very distressed by the fact I'm trying to escape from chronic porosities by keeping the full course, Although I developed some side effects  I have started to feel little Achill discomfort ! does that mean I may or certainly would develop to a rapture if kept going on cipro ?  secondly given the stress by taking cipro my urologist prescribed a less effective antibiotic trimethoprim as compromising protective against the return of infection to continue the last 2 weeks with. He also gave an option that I can leave with the hope alone and be sufficient with the 16 days 1000 mg day, or go with weaker antibiotic to the rest of the last two weeks without  grantee of securing the issue to the last possible point of no infection return.    how efficient is a two week course for completely treating acute prostatites that wasn't diagnosed with fluid analysis or any laboratory examination? The second major concern as raised above is the exercise capability! indeed cipro might be out the system physically but how long would it take the damaged collagen due to that intensive course of antibiotic would take to repair in order for my achillesl tendons to stand my heavy jogging on the trade mail? in other words in how long would i be able to resume my normal active life without fears of rupturing Achilles tendons.

My thyroid levels had gradually been increasing over a period of 5 years ( one percent every year),and had reached 9.1. Because I don't have any children and it was something I was considering the doctor and I decided that I should take medicine, have a blood test and take it from there. So for November and December 2014, I started taking 50mg of levothyroxine. My subsequent blood test revealed that my thyroid had gone back, bang into the middle of its normal range, meaning a 3. This was good news and I was happy. whilst I was waiting for my blood test results I stopped taking the medication for the first two weeks of jan 15. After speaking to my doctor he advised that I should carry on with 50mg until my next blood test. I feel that now that I know 50mg works, and after the realisation has hit that these tablets are for life I want to see if 25mg would also work. I have noticed some side effects in the past week like shortness of breath and great hunger which I did not experience the first time round.

Not really feeling any improvments on my health or on any of my symptoms, actually I was now gaining weight at a dramatic speed(very unlike me)... more night sweats, Very irregular periods(which had virtually stopped prior to this medication), sleeping even less than before, less of a libido, and almost lethargic during the day. I keep thinking my symptoms are going to improve so I call the doctor and express my concern with my feelings in regards to the weight gain, she says that the medicine should work in the opposite effect... that I should be loosing weight instead of gaining. Please also note that I do some amature modeling so my weight is an issue. So she suggests I wait and do more blood work after being on the .50mg for 6 weeks. I do and my latest results were... T4=7.3, TSH=26. After these results, she ups my meds to 0.075. I have been on this prescip for almost 30 days now. I have now gained over 22 pounds in a little over 3 months, with vary little change in my lifestyle, other than now trying to cut back on what goes in my mouth! I am very confused and would appreciate any input of what I should be or not be doing. I took it upon myself to stop taking the meds about 4 days ago. I think I am starting to feel better. I just know that I was not in perfect health 3 months ago, but I will say that I did feel better than I do now, and am willing to live my life like I was then... NOT NOW!! Please HELP!! "

She suggested taking the Synthroid an hour before eating breakfast and the Topamax with dinner... but what about in a week from now, when I'll be taking Topamax 2x a day?? Will I just take the Synthroid as lunch then?  Also it would be wonderful to know if these 3 medications have any side effects from all 3 being taken every day. Thank you so much!! I am 5'7, 180 pounds and used to be a steady 130. I am hoping to lose at least 30 pounds and my doctor told me this would help. People say it does help you lose weight, by curbing your appetite a lot. That disappointed me, because I have a huge appetite and I love food. I will miss eating food because it's a pleasure for me, not just filling you up when you're hungry lol. Also: I went to my doc to get help for ANXIETY, anger issues and recent mild depression. So why was I prescribed Topamax, an anti-migraine, epilepsy and bipolar medication? Thank you so much "

We did a test before starting any medication. You can see the results below: -TSH: 3.11 - T4: 8 - Free Thyroxine Index: 2.0 - T3 Uptake: 25 - Weight: 136 lbs My only concern is my weight. I've always been between 135-140 lbs with my weight being the lowest as soon as we started the Synthroid treatment. I have continued to eat fruits/vegetables/nuts/etc with the occasional treat for sticking to a healthy diet and I work out 4/5 days a week. I have gained 11 lbs following the treatment. It had dipped a week after starting and has just slowly continued to climb. I met with the Nurse Practitioner earlier today and brought my weight concerns to her. She doesn't think it's the Synthroid at all and questioned anything that I had read on the internet. I'm not one to self diagnosis but I did do a lot of reading on the issue and found others to have similar experiences. She says it's literally impossible for the drug to cause weight gain because of the science of the T4 component. See newest test results below: -TSH: 1.95 - T4: 8.1 - Free Thyroxine Index: 2.0 - T3 Uptake: 25 - Weight: 147 lbs She now wants to increase my dose from 25 to 50 and I'm hesitant to. I think I'm going to turn this into my own personal experiment. I have a friend who will be able to determine my total body fat percentage along with other important variables. Now my question is whether I should take the increased dose or not. Whether I stop taking the drug or increase, I will still revisit the body tests to see what changes. Other people online have suggested introducing more T3 supplements to help assist but I don't know much about that. Any thoughts or experience would be very helpful. Thank you! "

Here's my story, I've been on Lexapro for anxiety for almost 3 years (with continually telling my Dr to get me off of it!) I've gained over 40lbs, which Dr said was not contributed to the Lex, just that I ate too much/exercised too little. At the time it was prescribed I did need it, life was in a crazy tailspin but I am now fully functioning and life is going in a wonderful direction for the last two years - no anxiety attacks - ofcourse the Dr contributes this to the amazing work of the Lex... the Dr keeps telling me I need to take it for the rest of my life, I keep saying that I would like to cut back and see how much it is really helping. At my last appointment the Dr said I could try and stop taking it, the recommendation was to take 1/2 dose for two weeks, then stop... and see what happens. I feel that after being on any medication for an extended period of time you cannot just cut back and stop, I think I was being set up to fail...  So I took matters into my own hands, I am taking 3/4 of a dose for two weeks, and seeing what happens.. If all seems well then I will take 1/2 dose, and then 1/4 dose, then stop.. I don't think this is something that can be stopped ""cold turkey"". I am currently on day eight of my 3/4 dose and I know I am having withdrawal symptoms, such as a slight tingling everywhere from finger tips to toes, continual joint pain, a sort of continual headache in my neck/upper spine, and just a general feeling of being spaced-out. I don't think these symptoms are related to the anxiety which I had originally, and I don't think it is anxiety returning, however, I really feel like I am working extra hard to get through each day. On the other hand, I have had a huge drop in appetite, I not longer crave foods made with high amounts of sugar. I will try to keep posting on other side effects, and the outcome after my self prescribed weening off. My questions are: Has anyone who successfully stopped taking Lex been able to go on without it, and function normally? Have your original symptoms returned? How long did the strange withdrawal last, and what can you do to minimize it? "

Not to mention my scalp was about to itch off. Went to the ER and the doctor that night said I was allergic to the FD&C Yellow dye, so they put me on a different pill and all is well. (Although over the past 10 years, the Yellow Dye allergy has progressively gotten worse and I've had to change my soap, shampoo, and watch foods/beverages closely); however, the reactions to the Dye since the initial ""Hives"" reaction, has simply been a very reddening skin rash (of course, it hasn't built in my system for days like it did initially).  Fast forward 10 years, On September 15, I begain taking Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release 100mg Tablets. On the 22nd, my scalp started itching. The morning of the 23rd, I noticed a hive on the palm of my hand. By that evening, my waistline, and elbows were covered in hives (I stopped taking the meds the morning of the 23rd when I saw the first hive). Yesterday (the 24th), I was itching very badly, my hands were swelling and they were very red. I had a conference that I could NOT miss. By the time I got home last night at 6:30, my feet were completely swollen and the bottoms of my feet were covered in hives and I couldn't walk. The pain in my joints was horrible. Off to the ER for the benedryl, epinephrine, and steroid shot.  My question is - what is it in these drugs that cause this type of reaction? I cannot go through this again!!!  Thanks so much for any tips or adivce or answers you can give me!!!  Lesley "

Constipation is somewhat of a problem, but the main thing that effects me is GAS. Gas that I cannot expel from my body. I've tried peppermint tea and essential oils that I rub on my skin, baking soda, ALL of the OTC remedies and most recently something called ""IBgard"" that caused me to end up in the hospital . I was really looking forward to trying this stuff as samples I got from my G.I. I took 3 pills as directed on package and what resultsed can only be described as a huge pocket of air being trapped inside/under my ribcage. Nothing would make it stop. Trying to go to the bathroom was horrible as this ""pocket"" seemed to drop down to include my abdomen as well as my rib cage.

Lactulose for me has always resulted in going a little bit many times a day. I can't tell what is being digested at any given time. I guess I have a couple of questions here, and they are: 1. could the Lactulose increase cause excess gas? 2. Does anyone know of a better way to relieve intestinal gas?

However, when I left 3 days later my BP was low. I do not know the #s, but they told me so. The Dr. ask me if I was feeling faint, which I was not and he said not to worry about it then. Now, after I had a relaps 3 months later and made another appointment about a month and a half after that because as before, I could not detox on my own because the first time before I went to detox, I have tried several times, once up to 4 days and constantly vomited day and night, not being able to hold down food nor water. Also, the first time I tried on my own, I started vomiting only after 2-3 hrs. and needed about a half of a pint to settle my system then I could drink other fluids and eat... that's when I made the appointment with detox again. (Fortunatly in Michigan your permitted to go into detox 2x a yr. and I'm thankful) The second time, however, I went a little more than a 13 hrs before I started to vomit. I never had sezures, I had one or two blackouts in 15 yrs. of hard drinking, starting only on the weekends with whiskey then I started to depend on it more often. I was to the point where I didn't do it to get drunk but only to stablize my system to function properly. I was between a pint to a fifth a day (24hr. period) only a few times less as I started to get insomnia. The also gave me other standard pills and vitimans for detoxing.With that being said about my history, the second time was 12/7/13 at 8pm when I went in and felt that I was starting to DT a bit but didn't vomit, again and blow all 0.00 on the breathalizer as I didn't drink for about 9 hrs prior. So, my blood preasure was not low at this point but in the normal range, then on the 9th when they tested me it was 111/80 which they considered normal. I took my usual sleeping pill that they gave me and slept very hard and solid. The next morning, the 10th, my BP spiked to 178/107! The staff checked it 4 times, once with the squeeze ball and still came out about the same. Then told me it was high and none of the staff 'NEVER' saw such a thing!(?) I informed then that I had my first cup of coffee that morning in over 3-4 months that morning and had salt on every bit of the 6 eggs I ate over the weekend, but that didn't seem to be the issue. They asked me to get it checked, because they checked it again before I left the facility, it only came down a little 173/105. They told me to go to Walgreens where I could get it done for free, so the next day, drinking no coffee, I checked it and it was still high at 150/102 and then made an appointment with the free clinic for the 19th of Dec. My question again is, if they 'NEVER' saw such a thing with such a spike in BP so quickly and they've been open for yrs., what would cause this?! Also, the free clinic told me to keep monitoring it and if it went up from that point to call them and they'll get me in earlier. I'll do so tomorrow the 13th. I'm male, 53, 6'2""; 194lbs, up 5lbs since I went to the free clinic. Body Mass Index (BMI) 24.27. I don't do drugs nor do I take medication, and I haven't really change my eating habbits, and eat fairly well during the course of the day. I rarely even take an alleve or Ibprophen for minor aches and pain. Oh, and I had a fairly sharp pain in my shoulder blade area..may have sprained it while sleeping 1 days before, and they gave me 3 Ibprophen and a few hours later when that didn't help take the sharp edge off, they gave me a couple of tylenal which did the trick till the next day then they gave me 3 more Ibprophen and that did the trick and just had a mild ache there before I left; the pain is gone today. BTW, I had blood test done for organ damage and the blood tests came back good. The tests were: CBC (Dif/Pit)-Quest 6399, Lab293; LIPID PANEL-Quest 7600, LAB19; COMPLETE METAB PANEL-Quest 10231, LAB17; AMYLASE-Quest 243; LIPASE-Quest 606. My BP was 124/84 and didn't relaps yet. I had these tests done at the free clinic in Bay City, MI at Bayside Community Health Center for alcohol abuse about a month or so after I went to detox the first time... it was because I have numb and red feet for about 8 months from alcohol. The PA told me that it was from the alcohol, but I forget the name of the prognosis. They're not nearly as red nor numb as they use to be now also. One more thing. I've been drinking since the age of 15 and on and off till now at 53yrs old and contribute, as I want to believe, not have damage to drinking up to about a gallon of water a day. Also, my dad use to be a drinker, he's about 78 now. My grandfather use to drink a shot of whiskey a day in his older age to level his blood presure because it was low..he use to be a drinker also. He lived to be in his mid 80s. Thank You! "

Before the hysterectomy, her pressure, sugar level were normal except for hemoglobin level which was very low, probably because of the fibroids. Now, her hemoglobin is normal. Immediately after the operation she had UTI for a few months. After the operation nothing was normal. She had very high SGPT(which after a long 1 year battle seems a little normal), then her sugar went up and we cut down on her food and we have been successful in controlling her sugar level without any meds. It's been 5 months since she started going for a morning walk. And the worst of all, her blood pressure increased a lot, to the point that sometimes we had to take her to the hospital. She is currently on repace 25. We have replaced a lot of medicines and increased the dose too. She has cut down on meat, fried food, salt and eats quite a healthy diet(except occasionally).

Additionally, she takes garlic cloves, papaya, green tea, aloe vera, fenugreek water, wheatgrass juice, bitter gourd, watermelons, lots of veggies, ginger tea, divya arjun kwath, divya hridayaamrit vati ,roasted watermelon seeds, hibiscus tea, and milk+turmeric+saffron before bed.

High Blood Pressure,https://www.drugs.com/answers/lisinopril-side-effects-causing-symptoms-verapamil-3484601.html,Could lisinopril side effects be causing these symptoms? Is verapamil any better?,"I started taking lisinopril 10mg back in September after being diagnosed with high blood pressure from my gastrointerologist. Everything was fine up until November. At that point, I noticed that my heart would randomly start racing, exceeding 100 bpm sometimes. This was despite the fact that my PCP diagnosed me with Bradycardia back in August. I was sent to a cardiologist in December who told me not to worry about it, but decided to have me wear an event monitor for 30 days. After 30 days (and an ER visit, which found nothing wrong with me), he determined that I had SVT (basically random fast heart beats), did a stress echo test (which came back normal) and told me everything was fine.  Things were okay for a couple of weeks until I started to get random dizzy spells in mid February. After a week of dealing with these dizzy spells, I started to develop a cough, and now have waves of body tingles. I've also had random Blood Pressure spikes throughout the day as well as tons of irregular and skipped hear beats (which the doctors have seen on the event monitor and say not to worry about it). They did give me propranolol to take when I started experiencing irregular beats, but while it did help the skipped beats, that medicine just made me feel drained and detached. I've seen 3 different cardiologists who've all reviewed my test results, and they all say I just have anxiety, but these symptoms are very real. I had an appointment with another cardiologist today who said she doesn't think lisinopril is right for me, and is starting me on a low dose of verapamil (she even wants me to cut the dose in half). This made me wonder; could lisinopril have been the culprit for all these symptoms this whole time? I literally NEVER had problems with my heart racing or being irregular until I started taking lisinopril. I've also had severe anxiety since starting this medication, and all the doctors keep telling me this is all in my head.

It has helped my GERD tremendously. When I was 40 - I had my first colonoscopy. I had zero colon polyps... but a tortious colon (?). I had another colonoscopy last year (2013) and my Gastro found 7 polyps. Biopsy showed they were all pre-cancerous. She removed all of them. I had another colonoscopy a week ago. Five new polyps! My parents are still alive and have never had this problem. The only family member with a colon problem was my aunt (mom's sister). She died of colon cancer last year. My mom had a colonoscopy last year - zero polyps. Same for my dad. So my question is... is it a coincidence that I started getting colon polyps about the same time as I started Dexilant? I had NO colon polyps prior to starting this medication. The only other ""new"" medication I've been taking the past couple of years is a homeopathic pill called ""Clearin"". You can buy it at the Vitamin Store. I still get cystic acne and felt a homeopathic solution would be safer than going back on Acutane for a 3rd time ( I was on it once in my 20s and again in my 30s). "

Today I took Clonidine - .05mg at 9AM, .05mg at 1PM and .1mg 11PM tonight. Last night I noticed some irregular heartbeat stuff... felt like quick rapid beats for a moment. That happened through the day today as well. Tonight it seemed a little more and accompanied by anxiety and dizziness. I have taken my blood pressure and pulse multiple times over the last 2 hours. Its been inconsistent but high for me... once was 134/80, once 143/81 and the other times more in the 155/85-90 range. Pulse has been between 70 and 90 - varying. I'm also taking Suboxone - which I just started up yesterday - 2mg yesterday and 3mg today (2mg in the AM; 1mg in the PM).  Should I be concerned to the point of an ER visit?

From what I'm reading it could have something to do with stopping the Tizanidine abruptly? Even after only 5 days would that be an issue? Or could it just be changing medications quickly?

High Blood Pressure,https://www.drugs.com/answers/high-blood-pressure-newly-diagnosed-very-anxious-3273656.html,High Blood Pressure - Newly diagnosed and very anxious!?,"Hi everyone, I am a 35 year old male, and I have recently been struggling with high blood pressure, to the point where my doctor prescribed hydrochlorothiazide after visiting the office and having a reading around 155/95. I initially made the appointment because my blood pressure was around the 155/100 range a few days prior to that time.  Starting from the day that I found out that I have high blood pressure, I have been noticing all of these weird sensations in my upper left chest and around my heart, including fluttering sensations, feelings of pressure, and even minor pains or discomfort. The sensations in my chest come fairly randomly, and don't really correlate with exercise or anything else, and sometimes I won't notice them for hours at a time.  Prior to this doctor's appointment, I had not noticed any of these types of symptoms, and I have been going to the gym 3-4 days a week and doing 45 minutes of cardio on the elliptical. I do suffer from OCD, and I tend to have a lot of health related obsessions, and I know that chest pains and related symptoms can be from anxiety. However, these symptoms have been terrifying me, and I am convinced that I have severe heart damage and am in imminent danger of having a heart attack. Given the fact that all of these symptoms seemed to have started after finding out I have high blood pressure, the rational part of my brain tells me that it's purely anxiety related, but I also begin to doubt it and think ""maybe I did have symptoms and just didn't pay attention"" and other similar thoughts.   I have been monitoring my blood pressure since then (my doctor's appointment was a little over a week ago, but I only started taking the meds yesterday) and it tends to hover around 150/100, with spikes of 165/108 or so. The irony, of course, is that all of my worrying is likely to make my blood pressure go up, especially since the past few weeks have been particularly stressful anyway (I work in a very high stress internship, finished up my finals at grad school and then had graduation with friends and family in town).  I guess I'm wondering at what point is there legitimate concern that these symptoms are actually related to heart disease, and whether I should call my doctor ASAP I am meeting with him again in a month, but the worry and anxiety is taking over my life. At the same time, I'm also afraid to call him and ask him the questions because I worry they'll think I'm ""crazy', or whatever. I really can't seem to find anything online about how long it takes for severe heart disease to actually develop, probably because it differs for everyone, but I have managed to convince myself that having borderline high blood pressure for a couple of years and then this level of high blood pressure for six months or so (at my doctors appointment in September I had a reading of 138/88, I believe) is enough to push me into imminent heart attack range. I have convinced myself that having a diastolic pressure that reaches into the 105/108 range is particularly dangerous, especially after reading that it's more alarming to have higher diastolic numbers when you are younger.  I apologize for the long message, but I've been terrified about this for the past week or so. I am continuing to go the gym, and I've been adding ten-fifteen minutes of meditation into my daily routine, using an app to guide me.  Thanks for any help and support you all can provide! "
GERD,https://www.drugs.com/answers/protonix-stopped-working-371837.html,Protonix stopped working?,"In 2006 at 25 years old I was diagnosed with GERD, at which time I had an upper GI which revealed that I had an ""inflamed esophagus"". After taking numerous medications, and months of hardly eating, my doctor decided that I had an anxiety disorder which caused me to have reflux issues. I do not know what reflux medicines I took at the time, but after months of different medications I was put on Lexapro 10mg. for the anxiety, and I slowly went back to myself...  Now fast-forward to 2010, I decided to take myself off of my anxiety medication (the Lexapro, the only med that I was taking at the time). After 4 months off the Lexapro my anxiety came back with a vengeance, which then led to me getting all the same symptoms and the reflux and GERD back. I had tightening of the chest, behind the breast bone, excessive belching (very loudly), excessive gas, nausea, the feeling of emptiness in my stomach, other times a feeling of too-fullness with a small meal. I've tried to get relief from Tums but they leave my stomach feeling like a giant air bubble. I've tried eating small amounts of food to keep the acid down. I've tried limited diet, but everything from water to rice upset my stomach.. So in late December I began taking over the counter Prilosec every morning, which did not help. I went to the doctor, Jan 15th and he said to take one Prilosec in the morning and another one at night. After suffering two weeks I went back to the doctor.. I was then put on Protonix 40mg. once daily. I have taken the Protonix in the morning, generally 1 hour before eating for almost one month. It seemed to be helping, however within the last three days my symptoms have all been coming back. I've had no change in diet, or activity level.. I don't understand why the symptoms are suddenly resurfacing after seemingly diminishing for several weeks?? I have all day nausea, without vomiting. I have the feeling that there is a 'lump' in my throat, I have belching, gas, and it never seems to matter if I eat a little, a lot, or nothing at all... For three days now. From the moment I get up in the morning, until I go to bed I have had these symptoms. I also take Effexor XR 37.5mg daily for my anxiety (which I'm not sure if it is working properly).. I take this with my breakfast, 1 hour after taking the Protonix - this is the only thing I can think of that has changed recently... I used to take it with my lunch around noon. In addition I have the B/C Sprintec, a multi-vitamin, a vitamin C supplement, a vit. B-12 supplement, and a pro-biotic ""Pearl"". All taken at breakfast, about 1 hour after the Protonix.. Any suggestions are welcome, I am just baffled that something that seemed like it was going away is now suddenly re-surfacing.. "

The gas bubbles build up in his belly to the point where I can feel them if I touch his belly, and they get trapped and he can't ""Toot"" (as he calls it).

This occurs daily and I am about at wits end. Sometimes he will roll over on his belly and squirm and strain and is able to let out a couple of little ""Toots"" but not enough to do any good. Are there any other meds that I can try to give him or any other things that might help work the bubbles out so he can ""toot"" them out?

And just stopped it 5 weeks ago and put on Klonopin--lowest dose--couldn't tolerate it, so began weaning off and not have been off one week and pretty miserable. Is it because I went off the Xanax to the Klonopin and then fairly quickly off of that? And I take .25 mg of Atenolol daily for irregular heart beat and high b/p. Can take 2 a day if b/p elevates. Just reading where Atenolol can help in the withdrawal symptoms form Benzo's. I have chronic A-fib too, the other reason for the Atenolol. So, for a week now and no benzo's, I have been miserable--lightheaded/nausea/ dizzy/ difficulty sleeping and just feel 'rotten' really! Trying to 'push thru'. How long will this last since I was never on high doses of either of these Benzo's--but daily. And since I can take 2 atenolol, would it be ok to do that to help in this withdrawal process. I am a senior female and otherwise in good health. Just miserable with these withdrawal symptoms. How long before relief takes place? I don't want to go back on them after a week clear of both and 5 weeks clear of Xanax! Really tough at various times--tremors, nausea, lightheaded feeling and anxiety! Thanks "

Specifically, I would like some feedback on the effect of these transdermal testosterone gels on the following aspects of sexual function: 1) Rigidity of erection upon sexual arousal 2) Ability to become aroused (arousability)  3) Volume of ejaculate 4) Refractory period between ejaculations I have been on Testogel (Androgel) on and off, but have never committed myself to it due to the fact that it tends to elevate my oestradiol to supraphysiologic levels, even through I am not obese in any shape or form. If I resume T replacement, I shall include an aromatase blocker (such as Anastrozole) to keep my oestradiol in check.  When patients complain of transdermal T gels not working or losing effectiveness over time, it may be due to excessive aromatisation of T to oestradiol, which negates the therpeutic effects of the testosterone- get your oestradiol checked before changing to other T therapies, increasing the T gel dose or stopping T gel replacement altogether! You may well have an oestrogen issue, which can be tackled by including an aromatase inhibitor with your testosterone replacement regime. "

Gas,https://www.drugs.com/answers/long-bloating-doxycycline-2964277.html,How long will bloating from Doxycycline last?,"Hi everyone. Near the end of September, I started a 14 day course of Doxycyclin (the specific brand name was Cyclidox). 100mg twice a day, with lots of water, an hour before meals, as instructed. During the course I experienced severe bloating, trapped gas, abdominal cramps, abdominal pain, and belching (burping). The probiotics I was taking didn't seem to make any difference. I knew that any of the Tetracycline antibiotics, and especially Doxycycline, could have gastro side effects, and I stuck with the pills, after contacting my GP who prescribed them. I finished the course, and after three weeks, my digestive system still hadn't normalized. My GP then put me on a 10 day course of Nexium (a proton pump inhibitor) in case I had an ulcer. I took one 40mg tablet per day, as instructed, but this didn't seem to make any difference. I also took a different probiotic during the 10 days, which also didn't seem to help. I then waited another few weeks, until yesterday, when I went to see a gastroenterologist. He said the Doxycycline could very well be to blame for my bloating and belching, and that he wanted to perform an endoscopy. I had the scope, during which he examined my esophagus, stomach, and duodenum (initial part of intestines). After the procedure, he said everything inside me looks normal and healthy, and that the only thing it could be is IBS or dyspepsia. He said the symptoms may eventually go away. Just as an aside, my digestion and apetite are normal. I have been on no other medication. It seems highly implausible to me (and numerous doctors and pharmacists to whom I've spoken) that a two week antibiotic course could do irreparable damage to my digestive system. Does anyone have any experience with Doxycycline, other Tetracycline antibiotics, or other antibiotics that cause gastro problems? Could I have another problem, or something underlying that was triggered by the course? I finished the course of Doxycycline two months ago. How long could the bloating, etc. take to go away? Thank you in advance for any assistance and information. "

Also worried about going to Drs again, for he thought I should just start on an anti- depressant first and not do ADHD until I see if that worked, with my daughter being so successful with Concerta I really just wanted to try that first. Should I ask to add an anti-depressant- does that help with energy levels? Or should I try new ADHD med?? Do the headaches go away eventually? Does anything help with that side effect? "

I called my doctor who prescribed Paxil and said Paxil would not cauuse bloody and diarhea like I described and advised me to go back to Zoloft, but I did not think his decision is based on the proven experience and I am not takin Zoloft or Paxil (never want to take Paxil) at this time and it had been like 2 weeks now -- yes withdrawal simptoms occured like dizziness and physical imbalance, but not like others have descirbed about when they tried to go off Paxil (I think in my opinion Paxil is not for depression at all, at least for me was terrible, diarhea and insomnia even with sleeping pills.)

It's all I can do to get out of bed in the morning. I started taking Savella last year and, OMG, I was on cloud 9 all the time. So much so, I stopped taking my Lexapro. Well, two weeks later I'm in the ER thinking I'm having a gall bladder attack. The pain was excruciating and we soon discovered it was a result of my poor judgment - quitting Lexapro cold turkey. I called in sick yesterday (which is RARE) and slept all day and all last night and that just isn't me. Finally I had an epiphany and I'm starting to realize that the Lexapro just isn't working anymore. If anything, it's making me sick. I went to my primary care physician today and she wanted to put me on Wellbutrin BUT wants me to quit Lexapro all together before I start it.
