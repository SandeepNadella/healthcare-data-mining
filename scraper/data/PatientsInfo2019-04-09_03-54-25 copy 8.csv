I had been suffering a couple of months prior to having it come out. it needed removing but I it didn't solve the problem of the pain, nausea, bloating and vomiting. I have recently had a working diagnosis for SIBO. I've been in the hospital for over a month and have lost over 50 lbs. the hospital I'm in won't pay for the breathing test I need done nor the expensive  . They are just trying to get me eating and hydrating. when I get out of the hospital I will be going to have to pay to see a functional medicine doctor to pay to get the test so I know for sure then I will have to buy the antibiotics I need to treat it and go on a very strict diet to starve the bacteria. Once the bacteria is gone it can take 6 months for the small bowels to heal. I'm just putting this out there for people to maybe ask their Dr about or try to get the test for it if you have the symptoms I've been having. I will post the results of my breathing test once I've had it. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Anyways, I wanted to ask is it possible to wean off of Xarelto and being placed on an aspirin instead? I was told I had to be on blood thinners the rest of my life. I don't think I want to risk being on Xarelto the rest of my life, especially since there have been cases of interal bleeding, no way of rapid reversal (like warfarin) and also the fact there's not a lot of studies on the effects of taking Xarelto long term. I've been on Warfarin for my first case of PE's but it gave me alot of UTI's so I don't think I want to go with that either. I live a very healthy lifestyle now with my diet. I'm on a gluten free, dairy free, soy free diet, and have no problem getting in a lot of foods and vitamins that help to thin out the blood.  Would a lifestyle of a daily aspirin and some Vitamin A and E pills be good enough at thinning out the blood in exchange for Xarelto the rest of my life?   0 likes, 35 replies "

Now that same discomfort has begun to move around, lower left one day, lower right the next, upper right the next, and so on.  I have been doing some research and now find that Losartan may be the cause of this.

The Lisinopril gave him a terrible cough which drove me absolutely mad and although he was not bothered by it, he agreed to change his medication.  Initially, the cough did subside a bit, but never went away and just recently, his coughing is back to what it was when he was taking Lisinopril.  The cough is not productive and he has to cough really hard and loud (which hurts my ears if he is sitting next to me) to clear what he regards as congestion which he can't budge.  He is often wallking round the house at night coughing to clear what he thinks is a blockage of some kind.  This is doing both of us no good as we have a lot of interrupted sleep.  I downloaded the sleeptalk app to see how many times he was coughing through the night.  There were no less than 40 recordings in one night!  The cough is persistent during the day as well. He has also developed swollen ankles.  His doctor has said that it is to do with the valves in his veins not working properly, but I am not convinced.  I think it could be to do with his BP medication.  Has anyone else had this side effect?  I looked up the side effects on the leaflet that comes with the medication and on the rare side effects is swollen ankles. I look forward to hearing your comments. Marie 1 like, 40 replies "

Ankle Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/foot-orthoses-after-ankle-fracture-697606,Foot orthoses after ankle fracture,"Hi there, I need some feedback and expertise on the use of foot orthosis after severe ankle fracture 5 years ago. Here’s my story. I'm 30 years old. I've had a bimalleolar fracture following a wonderful episode of my ankle being severely crushed by a car. It might not be easy to recover from. It was more than 5 years ago. About 1 year after my surgery with my ankle fixed with 2 screws, I started to experience sciatica and plantar fasciitis on my uninjured leg due to gait problems associated with a loss in dorsiflexion and mobility on my injured foot. About 1 year later, they removed the screws. Over the years, I've been prescribed foot foot orthoses and physiotherapy by doctors (podiatrist and orthopedist). After that, physiotherapists suggested me not to use the orthoses and, instead, work on dorsiflexion exercices. Of course, since they advocate for physiotherapy, which, I believe tends to be a lot more physiological and multi-dimensional perspective than the medical system of prescriptions. I’m still doing exercices. However, when I try more intensive work of dorsiflexion, the pain tends to get too strong to keep it up which makes me believe it can’t get any better. I lost about 5 to 10 % in dorsiflexion. I used the foot orthoses for about a few months in total and it did not seems to relieve any or most of the pain. In the end, I never used them extensively since it did not seem to help with the pain at all. Years goes by and I sort of adapted, doing exercices, treating the sciatica with the use of pressure points and always concentrating on my walking pattern. I sort of got used to the pain, it did not bother me that much ever since. About 2 years ago, I also started to get SI joint pain on my back. I'm still doing exercices to relieve the pain today which also does not bother me much now. However, the pain still persists and I’m starting to believe that, despite all my efforts, the pain might be getting worse which is worrying me a bit. I just had an appointment with a foot specialist orthopedist who could only, again, suggest me to wear foot orthoses and exercices to treat the plantar fasciitis which I don't think is a bother at all compared to the other pains. I'm starting to think that my body can't adapt to my ankle instability and mobility and that I might have to wear foot orthoses for the rest of my life. Yes, I might be very stubborn about not wearing foot orthoses but I still cling to hope I can live without it because doctors can't even tell me if I can or not adapt to the injury, they seemed quite inexperience and don't seem to do any sort of study on long time rehabilitation at all. So now I'm trying to reach out. I'm wondering if anyone has any idea how I should proceed? I'm willing to start wearing foot orthoses on the long term. And I could live with it indefinitely. Just another mourning to live with I guess. I'm just wondering if wearing foot orthoses could be temporary and could ultimately rectify my walking pattern and maybe relieve the pain on the long term. But I'm quite skeptic. I feel like doctors prescribes foot orthoses because that's basically all they are trained to do : treating actual symptoms and prescribing. They don't seem to convince me in any way to actually wear them even if I ask them about the potential outcomes : they only tell me that it's gonna treat the pain symptoms. Plus, they seem to be strangely associated with the foot orthoses industry. It's a money system like another. I don't know if they profit directly but I would not be surprised. I'm sort of an active person, I keep doing cardio since i was a teenager. I'm also an occasionnal runner. I care about being able live without foot orthoses and running freely. On the long term I prefer my body to adapt to the injury than to the foot orthoses, which I feel is a life handicap. I heard stories of people adapting to worse injuries than mine without any sort of foot orthoses. I wonder if it could be a similar story for me. However, it seems like my attempt to correct my gait is starting to create balance problems and create complications, ence the sciatica and SI join pain that still complicates my daily activities. Anyone lived or heard of similars stories? Did anyone used foot orthoses temporarely after a severe ankle fracture to correct gait and lived without it after? Are there people who wear foot orthoses permanently but are still fully active and well? Thanks for reading and for any feedback 0 likes, 3 replies "
Ankle Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/share-self-care-tips-non-weight-bearing-for-2-broken-ankles--669082,"Share Self Care Tips: Non Weight Bearing for 2  Broken ankles,","I broke both my ankles 5 weeks ago, with surgery, pins and plates in one and a closed reduction in the other.  I have not gotten through a day without crying yet.  I’m so tired of not walking.  Nobody explains how bad your shoulders, back, elbows will hurt from trying to move around in such strange ways. Self care is hard to impossible and I have figured out some short cuts.  I’m trying to be patient, and appreciate the small things I can do.  One of which is to post here! 1. Try to have a family member stay with you for the first two weeks.  You will need help peeing, (use a “pee pot” by your bed.) bathing, eating.  You will also need someone to pick up prescriptions, rent shower chair, wheel chair......especially if you injured both legs like I did. 2.  Establish a nest, mine was in the bedroom, with a satilite location in the living room.  Fluff your nest with:     A mini fridge (we had one anyway)      Tv and remote      Fan       Pens and paper      Medicine/cream/chapstick      Laptop      Knee scooter, cast boots, ace bandages      We put mattress on floor in bedroom      Lots of pillows, blankets to elevate      Cooler with ice if you are still icing      A couple of sheets of 4 inch foam to kneel on when getting to chair or scooter      Baskets to hold things like snacks/fruit      Phone charger/ change of clothes......      Pinchers extendable to reach for things .......please comment with additions to the nest.............. 3. Satilite nest is just smaller version of above 4.  Showering- get a shower chair or an upside down 5 gallon bucket will do.  Just drape a folded towel over it for comfort.  You will drop things...a lot. Move from wheelchair or scooter to sit on side of tub.  Swing legs into tub. Then putting weight on hands move over to sit on chair or bucket.  Have helper nearby. Enjoy hot water, have help shaving first few times (razor was what I always dropped) get out the same way you got in stopping to dry off on the edge of tub.  You will need at least 3 towels.  If you are not too modest you can air dry on your bed.  Use cream on legs if you can ( not stitches). Before my stitches were out I used a bag on my leg. 5.  Eating, I usually snack during the day and hubby makes dinner when he gets home from work.   Now.....what’s in my mini-fridge?      Water      Grape juice      Chocolate milk (calcium)      1 coke....a treat not everyday      Yogurt strawberry whips      Sugar free chocolate pudding      Cheese slices (for cheese and crackers)      PB&J      Bran muffins (pain killers can constipate you 1-2 Kellogg’s bran muffins solves this) What’s in the snack basket?      Bread and crackers in snack basket      Baked chips      Apples      Bananas      Popcorn       I did not put a microwave by my nest but I really thought about it for things like hot tea, warm sandwiches........... couldn’t hurt, especially if you have a small extra one sitting around.   6.  You can send your “help” to the local thrift store or goodwill, Salvation Army to look for things like walkers, crutches, even the stabilizing boot, new they cost about 200 each, I’m not too proud to have doctor look at and approve a used one.  Unfortunately we had been issued 2 before I discover this.  We rented a wheelchair, but then bought one for 25 at a thrift store.  Also, you may find a small tv, mini fridge, or microwave for 10-40 dollars. I also needed  a fan as it was summer and I hate being hot. 6.  Healing you Mind This whole process can send you into a dark spiral of self pity and depression.  I’m at 5 Weeks and still I cry every day.  I also have PTSD like flashbacks to when I fell and the sound and feel of the cracking.  You must keep busy. But let yourself have some moments to cry.  We all cope differently.  I have made lots of lists! I have a notebook with: Remodeling my house, room by room drawings with paint chips and ideas. I also printed some Pinterest ideas to tape into the notebook. Schedule things to do each day, have hubby bring me the junk drawer with garbage can and zip loc bags to organize it. Dump clean cloths on my bed, I will fold and put in hamper. Sit me in kitchen, I will cut and dice things (Do this in am with hubby, you can smell stew cooking all day in crock pot) Write thank you notes if others are kind enough to visit or bring meals Have your pet ( mine is big golden retriever marshmallow) beside you......my fine boy just knew to stay with me, such kind loyalty. It helps to rub a furry head. Invite friends over to watch a movie or to watch a final or beginning episode of something. Potluck of course (no drinking it’s bad for healing) I didn’t read but you certainly can.  I watched vintage tv because Andy Griffith and MASH just makes me happy. You Tube can teach you ANYTHING! Teach yourself to crochet or to knit or loom knit which is easier.  Learn how to write in italics, origami? Listen to educational podcasts (iTunes has lots for free)  Online shopping! eBay or Amazon, I even ordered our groceries online from Walmart and the hubby picked up on his way home.  That way I always got what I needed. Organize your music on your phone into playlists Go online and use a service like Shutterfly to make photo albums with your family photos.  You can also make and order gifts with family photos like calendars aprons, bags, or pillows.   Keep in touch with others!  Everyday my husband came home from work we would roll me up, put me in the car and drive around.  Just getting out helps.   When you are ready you can use a store scooter to motor around grocery or Sam’s Club or hardware store.  A real restaurant makes you feel human, as does shopping.

Being on holiday I skipped the hospital and doctors until I got back to the UK, 3 weeks later, due to being able to walk/move it while I was away I didnt feel any need. However, four months and I'm still having issues with it, surprisingly I get a lot of pain and trouble with my ankle when I have not done a lot of steps or exercise and take it easy. Funnily enough I also had the same experience when I first did it, such as it didn't play up a lot when I was doing 10k+ steps a day, however, whenever I had a more relaxed day it would play up and be painful. I don't have full mobility off it yet, as still can't walk in heels!

Ankle Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/good-story-3-weeks-post-op-fibula-fracture-697652,Good Story - 3 Weeks Post Op Fibula Fracture,"Hi everyone, thought I would share a good recovery story. I broke my fibula about 5 weeks ago and got surgery 12 days later with 7 screws and a plate. I got my cast off 2 weeks post op and doctors said x-rays were looking good. I asked the doctor if I could start bearing any weight and he said while he doesn't recommend it I could try a little bit around the apartment if tolerable. I was given an air cast and told I would be allowed to rehab the ankle a bit and gain some flexibility and range of motion by stretching it and doing circles. Doctor said in 3 weeks I will be able to start full rehab with complete weight bearing. First 5-6 days I just kept stretching it and got some range of motion back with stiffness gone. Two days ago I decided to try walking in the air boot with crutches and found zero pain. Yesterday I tried walking without crutches and just the air boot and found no pain either. Today I decided to take a few steps barefoot and was surprised to find zero pain and relatively easy to walk. I'm still taking it slow and only taking a few steps in my apartment, but I'm happy that I'm able to rehab it this fast. Thought I'd share this with you because a few weeks ago I was devastated being immobilized and now I feel close to recovery. 3 likes, 9 replies "

I have doubt that his examination wasn´t fully reliable. He made this test which I think was similar or very close to anterior drawer test for ATFL (his pulling may have been more plantar- than anterior-directed): I was lying on my back with my ankles and feet outside the plinth, then he grabbed my calcaneus and pulled gently (ankle with sprain-like accident). I said out loud to him: why do I feel a clunk? I didn´t feel the same clunk/gap when he pulled the calcaneus of the un-injured leg. He answered me that ""it´s good that there´s space there"". And he didn´t diagnose anything assuming ATFL-injury or joint laxity. Is it possible for the patient to feel a clear clunk-feeling with anterior drawer test, but still have a negative test result with no excessive joint laxity?

I also tested positive for SIBO two years ago and I've been living with IBS since I was a child.  I went to a rheumatologist about a year and a half ago and he suspected AS but I tested negative for HLA-B27 and my ex-rays at the time were non conclusive.  My symptoms are dull, aching pain in my lower back, hips, buttocks and legs. Sometimes it's just my thighs, other times it radiates down my calf and into the tops of my feet. I get a really bad pain just below my knees, where the chin bone meets the knee. I have always been active but the past few years have lost a lot of flexibility due to my hips; everything just feels stiff. Sitting is the worst. Laying down is uncomfortable without my heating pad and the pain will wake me up many nights. It's worst in the mornings and a few hours after a workout but not during the workout itself. I go through periods without much pain, but then they flare up and I hobble around.  I've been dealing with this pain for awhile, but in the last month my achilles tendon on my right foot has been very painful. This kind of came on out of nowhere and doesn't seem to want to go away. And now the bottoms of both of my feet ache almost like they are bruised. I had let the AS theory go but in my research about my achilles it came up again.  I guess I'm just seeking opinions. I'm not sure if I should try an orthopedic doctor or go to another rheumatologist. It seems like many of my symptoms line up with AS but of course they line up with a few other things as well and I'm making myself crazy with the internet researching.  Thanks for reading!

Ankylosing Spondylitis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/new-dx-of-as-after-years-of-issues--687705,New DX of AS after years of issues...,"Hi All, I tested positive for HLA-B27 after an MRI showed inflammation in my SI joints. I'm 48 and have had recurring back pain for about 15 years. I've usually been able to improve my symptoms with yoga, ibuprofen and the occasional muscle relaxer. For the last 7-8 months the pain areas are mid back, hips, buttocks and legs. Ive had numbness and tingling in both feet off and on. My insurance company denied MRIs twice, even after 8-weeks of PT wasn't helpful. Finally had the MRI last month and that led to blood tests. So now I'm waiting for my appt with the rheumatologist. My eyes are affected - I had no idea the redness and irritation Ive had recently could be tied to my back and hip pain. Clearly my doctor didn't either because he's had me using drops for dry eyes. I see a GI for stomach issues too. All of these seemingly unconnected symptoms and no one put the pieces together until I finally got the MRI. My fear is I lost years of treatment time and treating this will be harder now. Any advice before my first appt? I'm finding it difficult to do the yoga that has been helpful before. Walking can be helpful on a good day, but sometimes makes the pain worse. The worst part for me is my 1.5 hour commute. Car time is not helpful, but a lot of walking to and from the train - especially in cold weather -  has been hard too. Sorry...venting! 0 likes, 7 replies "

Ankylosing Spondylitis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-story-a-pain-in-the-ass-ankylosing-spondylitis-696319,My Story :  A pain in the Ass - Ankylosing Spondylitis,"Hi All, I am Amit from India It was winters of 1991,  I remember jumping from my school bus window (dont ask me why) and a day later  experiencing some pain in my right hip and lower back. I thought that the pain might be due to a muscle pull and ignored it as it went away in couple of days. I was back leading life like a normal 13 year old boy but for the pain to return in a fortnight and this time it was excrutiating and it seemed that my right hip joint was frozen as I couldnt put any weight on it while walking. We consulted an Orthopaedic doctor who though wasnt sure of the reason for pain but after looking at x-rays, put a traction on my leg. He wanted to pull out some fluid from my thigh/groin area (at my home only and not at a lab) for diagnosis but then we never heard back from him. As the pain subsided in weeks to come, i rejoined school and was doing normal chores. In the winters of 1992, i again felt that pain and this time visited a hospital. I was admitted there for good 15 days and after another set of x-rays and a Mantoux test, i was told that I might have Bone TB and was put on medication (some injections every 15 days for 2 months and NSAIDs). Over the next 7-8 years, i met 4-5 different doctors, was admitted to 2 different hospitals, had numerous x-rays, bone density, bone culture, bone marrow aspiration, Mantoux test, CT scans and an MRI done but nothing was conclusive to tell me the reason of my pain and loss of movement in right hip but all this while i was given medicines (NSAIDs) for Bone TB. I even tried Homeopathy, Ayurveda, Accupressure but nothing worked. The journey from puberty to adulthood was one i’d like to forget. For years I was in pain, moving inside house by holding walls or doors and would suddenly stop coz of excrutiating pain that ran down from my spine till my foot. Sitting in the balcony and watching my friends play, i wondered if i will ever experience that feeling again. By the time i turned 16-17, i had to give up playing cricket, football and cycling. Whenever my friends asked me to come play or hangout, i always made an excuse or other as it will take me minutes to walk out of home and climb down the stairs. I was confined to my home and gradually lost touch with most of my friends. Ankylosing Spondylitis not only impacted me physically but mentally and emotionally too. One thing I constantly heard from my Doctors and everyone who visited me was “You are too young for all this” but during all this while i wasnt feeling like a normal young lad but an old man. I was too frustrated with the constant pain, loneliness and being home. It was the turn of millenium and finally one Doctor asked me to go for HLA B27 test. I was finally diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis. A disease that has no known causes and no cure too. It targets the sacroiliac joints in adolescence and spreads to spine, neck and chest. As the inflammation spreads, new bones forms as a way to repair the damage resulting in hip joints and spine to fuse together. I was happy that finally i knew what i was suffering from but sad that the diagnosis came a little late by 8-9 years. By now my right hip joint and spine were fused and I had a stooped posture known as Kyphosis. My Doctor suggested a hip replacement surgery as the only option. To go for a surgery or not was a big decision and I was hesitant. Me and my family met couple of more doctors who advised us against the surgery because of the risks involved as THRs werent popular and successful at that time in India. I went back to the Doctor who advised me of surgery in the first place and he categorically stated that due to mis-diagnosis and having NSAIDs and Bone TB medicines for almost 7-8 years, he cant put me on any medicine and surgery was the only option. I was informed that if I decide not to go for surgery than its possible that my left hip joint will also get fused as it was bearing most of my body’s weight. Come 2006-07, my right hip joint was totally fused however left still had some movement. By 2008, A lot of surgeons had started doing hip replacement surgeries in India. We did our research and landed at the clinic of one of India’s renowned hip replacement specialist. He assured us that its safe to go for a THR and even gave us references of work he had done. We spoke to couple of his patients and a month later, I had my right hip replacement surgery done which though got way complicated than a normal one but by God’s grace I was in good hands and surgery was successful. An year later i was operated on the left one. Both surgeries were followed with months of physiotherapy. Though these surgeries gave my life a new perspective and i was almost 90% mobile however a common drawback of these surgeries is shortening of leg. Due to extreme wear and tear in my right hip, Doctors had to put an extended hip implant and as a result my right leg was shorter than the left by an inch. I used padding inside my shoe to minimise that impact and did stuff that i never thought i will be able to do like walking long distance, driving, para-sailing, para-gliding, etc. By 2017 i was once again feeling dis-comfort in my right hip joint. I consulted a doctor near my place who advised me to visit India’s premier medical institution, AIIMS. I met a team of senior doctors and a medical enthusiast who after carefully examining my case, suggested that they can do a revision surgery and will make a 3D Titanium cage to compensate the loss of bones from previous surgery. It took them almost 9 months (multiple prints, prototypes, amendments and improvements) to make a replica of my pelvic bone in Titanium and there I was lying on the operating table again. It was India’s first 3D hip replacement surgery and i was both excited and nervous being a part of it. It was a team of 10-12 multi-disciplinary doctors who operated on me. After cutting me open, at first, they thought of not putting-in the new joint as the nerves and veins inside my thigh/hip  region were badly tangled and it was risky to cut any of them but then they had a resolute to give me a better life and they decided to go ahead with the surgery. For the next 12 hours doctors struggled but did an amazing job in not only keeping me alive but also decided against amputating my leg as my illiac vein got badly severed during surgery. After a marathon 9 hour surgery, they had almost stitched me back but had to cut open again due to thrombus (blood clots) in my leg and lack of blood flow, it took them another 3 hours to remove the blood clots and yet again save me from an amputation. * Life has been a roller coster since the surgery, at times I am myself amazed that I made through a 12 hour surgery, day and half of induced coma, ventilator, 12 units of blood (more than what an average human body has), 6 units of plazma, countless IV drips, injections, medicines, more than 50 stitches and 27 days in hospital. Its almost 11 months that i had my surgery, am still walking with a forearm crutch and have another thrombus (blood clot) in right leg for which i am on medication. Though i am single so dont have to worry about a girlfriend/spouse and/or kid(s) but who wouldnt want a family. Also my employers couldnt give me more leaves so i had no option but to leave my job and am currently unemployed. ना नौकरी ना छोकरी !!! Lol. My tough times have taught me that when you are successful, independent, have money, time - there are so many friends but when you lose a job, money and are dependent - everyone disappears emotionally and physically. While i was in hospital, I remember sending a text to almost everyone in my phone book a night before my surgery, probably half of them replied and wished me luck and prayed for my well being. The remaining ??? Everyone becomes so engrossed in their life (and possibly new friends) to even be bothered about you but then again, my friend circle has shrunk in size but has increased in value and i love them all. Life can continue throwing random stuff at me but i will live with my chin up and smile. Afterall I am too young to have Hip replacements or Die !!! 0 likes, 2 replies "

So lately, I've had some strange chest discomfort or pain. When it first started, I really didn't worry, since I've always had some chest discomfort after a SVT procedure. But it's getting worse. So here is the best explanation I can give you: My chest has a funny feeling, like a pressure but not really at the same time. Feels uncomfortable and has a ticklish-like feeling, like a tiny bit. The pressure or discomfort with the kinda-ticklish-feeling wants to make me cough. This type of discomfort in the chest is similar to the discomfort you feel with palpitations. This discomfort usually happens at night, but also at day. It's hard for me to sleep and keeps me a little worried. I'm just wondering if this is angina. I also think I've found the culprit to this discomfort. I sit on my chair playing games and watching stuff for hours. I've recently found out that doing that can 'cause serious heart diseases. I've been doing that for about an year or so. Maybe that can be the reason, or maybe not. This discomfort is unbearable, it's just so annoying and uncomfortable. If this is perhaps dangerous, please let me know. I've went to my cardiac doctors, and they say my heart is fine, but that was about 4-5 months ago.  Just please, I'm worried.

Now going for angiogram and possible stents,"My husband had an episode of severe chest pain when working abroad. He had been swimming 'hard' for 30 minutes or more and giving all he had. A friend took him to hospital where they decided he had angina. From that day he has been taking meds but has had no pain (despite ignoring the Dr and going back to swimming - just not quite as hard as he had been). On return to UK our GP reduced the number of tablets he was on and he was still fine. Tomorrow he is having an angiogram and if necessary stents. I am finding it really hard to accept he needs this intervention as he has had absolutely no problems before or after that one episode. It scared him enough to make lifestyle changes and he has already lost over half a stone. Personally I feel it is an overreaction (because he is being seen privately) but everyone else tells me I am wrong. He is a 'big bloke' and I know people look and think 'high cholesterol' (his is in fact low). He has had a thyroid problem which is also being checked out and I wonder if the recent raised reading is a result of some of the medication he was taking. He is absolutely fine at the moment.

Angina,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/is-this-microvascular-angina-or-something-else--667289,Is this microvascular angina or something else?,"Hi All, I have been experiencing unexplained symptoms for over 2 years and wondered if there is anybody out there that can share similar experience or offer some guidance as to what my problem could be. It started 2 yrs ago with episodes of a kind of vertigo feeling. Like a falling feeling. I also suffered with a discomfort just to the left of my spine near my shoulder blade that may or may not be related. I initially shrugged it off. It happened 5 or 6 times over a 6 week period then went away for a year. Then it returned with a vengence! the episodes now came with a horrible sense of doom along with pain in the tips of my shoulders, palpitations and chest pressure. I was sent to both cardiology and the musculoskeletal unit. Cardiology had me do an echo, ecg and stress test but found nothing. MSK did an MRI of my thoracic spine but found only moderate degenerative disc disease that they say is normal. MSK did an examination of my thoracic spine and found significant stiffness in the muscle that runs down the left of my thoracic spine. They gave me exersises to do and discharged me with a diagnosis of possible T4 syndrome.  By this time I began experiencing a deep aching in my back, chest, left neck, jaw and the left side of my face. This can come on at rest, last anything from 5 mins to 45 mins then go away as if nothing was wrong. i have experienced episodes of involuntary arm curling with the vertigo/doom episodes although this has only happened 3 or 4 times in 2 years and passed quite quickly. It had me feeling I was about to have a heart attack. I also began to experience a discomfort with my breathing. Feeling as though Im not getting a satisfying breath. This also comes and goes at random. I experience dizzy spells too. Over the last 12 months this has gotten worse. I was referred back to cardiology and fitted with a holter monitor (found nothing) They tested me for a pheochromocytoma (nothing) and finally a CT angiogram that showed no calcification and clear main arteries although they did say the smaller vessels could not be seen on the scan and that they couldnt rule out MVD or microvascular spasms. They discharged me with a note to my GP to try me on nitrates and calcium channel blockers to see if they improved my symptoms. My GP tried me on nitrates but they made me feel ill and I stopped them after a couple of weeks. My GP wont try me on CCBs because I am taking propanalol and says the two cannot be taken together. Since then Ive been left to suffer. No further investigations, no diagnosis and a worsening condition. In the last couple of weeks the weather has been really hot and I have noticed my symptoms are worse, difficulty getting a satisfying breath along with the usual angina type pain referal pattern. Now I also get a feeling of a knife between my shoulder blades that comes on, is really painful and then goes away in a couple of minutes.  I really dont know where to turn next. Ive also seen a Rhuematologist that said he could explain some of my symptoms but not all and questioned why I had never had a invasive angiogram. He also advised me to push for the CCBs. I have registered with a new GP but I havnt seen him yet. I have lost confidence in my old GP as I dont think she knows what to do. My blood tests show a raised lipid profile. Combined HDL LDL ratio of 6.1 but my Tryglycerides are at a massive 5.7 and I have been offered nothing to help it except ""change your diet""... I eat the odd take away like everyone else but i dont eat unhealthily at all. My Ferritin levels are at 700 but my C reactive proteins are normal indicating no inflammation and I am not anemic. My red blood cell count is slightly lower than it should be but apparently not enough to account for the breathing issue. I was also B12 deficient at 172. I am on injections for this but no mention of any further tests to get to the bottom of things.  I am 39 yrs old. Male. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Let me start at the beginning: I'm 5'3"" and currently 170-ish pounds. My diet isn't as healthy as I want it to be and I don't exercise much aside from walking and riding my bike around. It started about a month ago, while I was working. I hadn't been getting good sleep because of work-related stress and anxiety, and as a result my energy levels would drop off randomly during the day and I'd feel off-balance and sluggish. One day it got to the point where I couldn't focus and I felt like I was going to pass out, along with what felt like muscle tension on the sides of my chest, under the armpit, as well as shoulder/neck tension and headaches. Fast-forward to a couple weeks ago and I keep having headaches along with sluggishness, and making frequent trips to the bathroom to calm down. Of course, searching my symptoms only made things worse for me. It got to the point where, on Thursday of this week I felt a painful jolt in my chest, right over my heart, which was preceded by what I thought was a heart attack. I was breathing quickly, I was cold and had chills, I was shaking, my muscles from my face and chest to my belly were tight and spasming. My heart rate was elevated and I wound up calling 911 because I thought it was a full-blown heart attack. Once at the hospital I had tests done, including an EKG, D-Dimer and the usual blood work along with an X-Ray. To my (brief) relief everything was in the clear, my heart is healthy and I am at little risk for a blood clot (D-Dimer level was at 450.) Now onto today: I want to believe that what I'm experiencing is work-related stress, but I still have a sore muscle on the far left side of my chest, just below the collar bone and close to my armpit, it itches when my clothes rub against it and I have headaches that won't go away, even when I'm not at work. Not only that but I feel split-second aches in parts of my body, especially in my left arm, my legs and the right side of my groin. I'm still experiencing headaches, tiredness and muscle aches on the left side of my body along with itching on the far left side of my chest, along with another feeling; something I can't describe. It happens for only a second but then I feel weird, like I break out in a cold sweat for a second and it feels like my heart is being squeezed for a split second, though I wouldn't know what that feels like. I've felt this after walking briskly. Part of me wants to believe that it's not heart-related or angina-related since I've been to the hospital, but there's a nagging feeling in the back of my head that I'm not in the clear. I need reassurances here: Could this be angina related or is it just stress/anxiety? I don't want to go to the hospital again nor do I want to die. I'm losing my mind trying to figure this out. 0 likes, 15 replies "

Right after I was put on 75mg of Plavix and 81mg of Aspirin to prevent clots. I do realize this is a Warfarin Discussion but I couldn't find any discussion more closely related for my question. My bad luck that I've been in abdominal pain for the last three or four years and after many doctor visits the cause was finally diagnosed by accident. I needed a abdominal hernia repair and on April 18th a local surgeon performed an open procedure to repair the hernia. He cut away ten inches of a thirteen inch forty year old spleen removal scar to gain access to the hernia in order to place the repair mesh. Yes the bad scar tissue wasn't all he threw away, along went seventy-five percent of my pain. So quickly I made an appointment to have the rest of the scar cut out but was interrupted buy the stents, Now my surgeon says I must wait one year before the cardiologist will allow me to go off the Plavix and Aspirin. The surgeon says he won't be able to stop the bleeding. So is that true? No way to cut that last three inches of pain out while on Plavix and Aspirin? Anyone know a way around this? Has anyone had surgery minor or otherwise while taking Plavix? Is three months still too risky? I'm in pain and getting very upset thinking I'll need to suffer another year.

As the months went on my anxiety got worse I convinced myself I had a brain tumour and that I was weeks away from dying. I spent thousands on councillors and was ready to spend £3k on an   of my brain. I had to take 6 weeks off work and nearly lost my house and my family.... can pretty much say it was the worst time in my life by a long way! I refused to take and pills doctors gave me as I was sure I could figure out a way to over come this on my own and I did and after 9 months I'm back to my old self. I tried 2 SRIs and knew straight away I never want to take them again. what I did to make myself better was read alot! I taught myself meditation   on apps on my phone..this really taught me to relax as most anxiety is a form of stress. I learnt to take breaks for day to day stresses and make time for myself to relax.  I also took high strength CBD oil which for me was the best thing I found. I gave myself a daily routine before going back to work which involved mindfulness exercise and reading. slowly week by week I slowly got better. some days were worse and some were better. I slowly stopped having thoughts of brain tumors the   I had for the best part of 3 months slowly went away and I started to get my life back. I started running and listening to music which gave me focus and I started to surround myself with people that made me laugh...mostly my 3 year old daughter and my partner. I'm not saying what I did is the cure for everything but it is possible to control this condition and get your life back you just need to find the way the works for you.

Anxiety Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/please-help-me-cardiac-anxiety-is-driving-me-crazy--698442,"Please help me, cardiac anxiety is driving me crazy :(","Hello everyone, it's my first time here and I was hoping to get some support because this drives me absolutely crazy at times. I'm 21 year old female, and I've been a pretty healthy person my entire life. But recently, I've been really anxious when it comes to my heart, and I keep worrying that it might stop at any time and I might have a heart attack even with no prior symptoms. I've had what I believe is known as sighing dyspnea since I was about 13-14 years old, but multiple doctor's visits have ruled out anything worrisome. Only recently have I been worried about it being being related to a heart condition, and the random news articles about relatively young and healthy people suddenly dying from undiagnosed heart conditions puts my anxiety in overdrive. I have no family history of heart problems, or relatives who have died of heart attacks, and I do not consume alcohol, drugs, and I don't smoke. My diet is pretty healthy, and I drink lots of water, so I try to tell myself that to find some sense of calm. I was doing okay for a while. (Also, I found that exercise helps me tremendously, but now I'm so scared that it would kill me) I guess what recently triggered this again would probably be the sudden, unexpected loss of my beloved cat... I had about 2-3 pretty bad anxiety attacks in the weeks following that, and it scared me because I have never gone through one before. I felt my heart rate increase, palpitations, and a sense of feeling faint and dizzy. I learnt to control my breathing, and tell myself that I am in no real danger, and that has helped to keep those at bay for the past two months. A month ago, I developed a viral fever, and I was obsessively Googling even the most common and ordinary symptoms (low-grade fever, fatigue, sore throat, etc) that I never previously worried about. I woke up from a nap with palpitations, and for a few days I was checking my heart rate multiple times a day (it was slightly over 100 bpm).  I started to Google why I had palpitations, and though there were many sources saying that it's normal for heart rate to increase during an illness, I wasn't reassured. While I was continuing my Google searches, I came across a news article about a young girl who passed away after a flu virus infected her heart, and that did it. I was terrified of the same happening to me. I woke up the next morning feeling extremely panicky and anxious, and went to the doctor. He told me that it was just a virus, and when I asked about flu complications, he told me not to worry about all those because the elderly were the ones who were most at risk. That, and the fact that I didn't even have the flu, calmed me down a bit. It helped that all my symptoms disappeared after I recovered. However, my mom has had tachycardia for the past couple of years and has not gotten it checked out at the cardiologist as the palpitations start and stop relatively quickly, and ECGs she has done during routine check-ups always show nothing worrisome (apart from the fast heart rate). But she had a pretty bad episode a few weeks ago, and this triggered all my anxiety again, and I started wondering if she had a serious condition that would strike when we least expected it. I begged her to go for a check-up at the cardiologist and now she has, so that has helped me find some peace. But now I am sick again - with the common cold, and I have a sore throat. I started checking my heart rate again and sure enough, it has risen a bit, to about 92 bpm (my average resting heart rate is about 80 bpm). And now I've started worrying all over again 😦 I don't have palpitations, or any other symptoms that would normally scare the crap out of me, but I'm just so scared that there's something wrong with me. At my last check-up about a year ago, my blood pressure and pulse, and all my blood tests came back as normal. I even had a chest x-ray done two years ago and my heart looked normal. I have never done an ECG, or any other tests related to the heart, but now I'm wondering if I should... but even the prospect of that is terrifying me. Does anyone have any words of reassurance, similar experiences, or any advice? I would truly appreciate any replies. Thanks for reading everything. 0 likes, 8 replies "

I've managed to come off of it at least twice over the last 5 years and only stuck to a low dose of 7.5 mg. I was initially prescribed it for a sleep. It worked well at low dose until it stopped some two months ago. I made a mistake of upping the dose to 15 mg, which made me semi- psychotic !!! Paranoia, extreme  , agitation. After two days and emergency appointments with several GPs where I was advised to reduce to 7.5 and then swap it for venlafaxine. Somehow I fear it is not a brilliant idea given that venlafaxine is even harder to quit.  I tapered off to 7.5 hoping that it may work again and, although it eased anxiety, I still felt horrible : 2 hours  sleep, constant panic attacks,   , depersonalization.  In desperation I decided to start tapering off - at first to 6 mg. Been on 6 for a week and anxiety and dizziness  are even worse and constant.

I recently suffer from weird short dizzy feelings. I already had sometimes those dizzy feelings, but now it's different. It starts with high intensity of stress and anxiety. Mostly the anxiety and stress comes out of nowhere with no specific reason. I already fainted once in my life and feels like those last moment when you lose control and fall down. It usually only holds on for like 5 seconds, but those seconds are very intense. I'm afraid that there comes a moment that I will actually faint. I don't know if it's just anxiety, because this dizziness feels different. I recently checked my blood on couple of things, but nothing came out of the test except a little short on Vitamin D, which I take supplements for for like 2 weeks so I don't think that could be it. I really would like some advice here.. My biggest anxiety comes from losing control. A case of that is that I have constant feeling of being not really on this earth and my vision and body feels weird. Hard to explain. Anyway, those dizzy moments doesn't help me at all and causes stress even after it happened. 0 likes, 4 replies "

Anxiety Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/internal-vibration-sensation-caused-by-stress--525091,Internal vibration sensation - caused by stress??,"I've found several forums where there have been posts from people experiencing this disconcerting feeling of an internal quivering or vibration but none of them are current, so I wanted to see if anyone else out there is having the same experience and can share an insight into what might be causing it. I started to get this feeling of internal vibration when I was mainly lying in bed and then occasionally if I shifted position it might last for 30 seconds or so before disappearing. That was about 8 months ago. Now I feel it every night and during the day as well quite often. The other day after a short walk of a few hundred yards followed by a period of standing still it felt like the ground was vibrating  because it was in my feet. It seems to move around to different areas of the body - sometimes I feel it in my legs, an arm, torso - it's quite random but often felt when I've shifted position in bed. At first I thought it was circulatory but now I think it's probably neurological. I thought I was having   but an ECG showed nothing abnormal. I've also had a full spine & brain MRI as I've been having other strange symptoms of occasional numbness and sensations of burning and cold areas of my arms/hands and legs/feet and a sore tongue which comes and goes and often feels like I've just cleaned my teeth with menthol toothpaste when I haven't. I thought I had all the signs of MS, but it hasn't been diagnosed. I've also had a number of   for immune issues, evoked potentials and nerve conductivity tests. Nothing! The MRI does show a lot of wear to my cervical vertebrae and two anterior spondylolisthesis - one cervical, one lumbar, so I wonder if my spinal issues could be the cause. My neurologist was doubtful. He also couldn't explain the vibration sensation except to say that it can be caused by a  , which I certainly haven't had.  I just don't know where to go with this now.  My GP isn't interested and puts everything down to stress which I AM under it's certainly true to say, but I don't think she's right. I've had to pay for all my neuro investigations as a result because she won't refer me or do any more blood tests etc.  I'm trying homeopathy, osteopathy and acupuncture as I want to find something that will relieve these weird symptoms and prefer to avoid drugs if I can. I'm 58, eat reasonably heathily, no alcohol, only 1 cup of coffee a day and my weight is normal. I broke my wrist badly at the end of August last year which is when my problems all seemed to start. i I also wonder if the metal plate that was used to fix the fracture could be causing some kind of strange reaction.

A constant bounding pulse, which is visible in many parts of my body including, my stomach, my neck, my wrist, my groin etc even my feet. It is really frustrating as it rocks me about in bed at night and I struggle to sleep because of it. I can also hear my pulse loudly when I have my head on my pillow. Tinnitus, which is high pitched and very distracting Headaches which are almost constantly... These often feel like a sinus headache. I also have a few lymph nodes that can be felt which have been scanned and said to be reactive and just working normally. Possible IBS as well. So far I have seen ENT, gastro, cardiology, neurology, immunology. I have head two head mri's, echo, colonoscopy, immuno investigations to name a few but everything is coming back good. I've even done an at home tilt table test and my bp and hr were fine. I am a 29 year old male who was previously a fit, active gym goer.

I have stopped smoking cigars and stopped lifting weights over a year ago and dropped 42 lbs. I have been feeling much better, more energetic and less lethargic, moving quicker and with ease.  Sunday night was my wife’s birthday. To celebrate, we went to one of our favorite Peruvian restaurants and I decided to go off for a night. And I mean I went off. Appetizers, entree, dessert and a small pitcher of sangria (holds approx 4-5 glasses).  I came out of the restaurant stuffed and tipsy (obviously wife drove home). Why did I do this? Without getting into much detail, I was venting several concerns and circumstances beyond my control that have been bothering me.  I checked the scale the next morning and expectedly I gained approx 4 lbs of water weight. Being a former competitive bodybuilder in my 20’s I expected this would happen and I would slowly rid the excess water weight by the end of the week.  The actual concern is I have been getting these really odd chest pains right under my solar plexus. It comes very random and it was strong enough to wake me up in the middle of the night Monday morning. It almost feels like heartburn, it’s random and what it feels like is several “thumps” of pain. It’s not severe, but it’s enough to make me wince a little, then it goes away. I have taken Tums, Gas-X and Omeprazole, which all barely helps. My wife thinks it’s gas but I am concerned it may be more and may be affecting my AAA. Since Monday morning, I am still getting this but with less frequency.  What are your thoughts please?  0 likes, 21 replies "

I've done research on dissection, and different approaches for aneurysms at this location. His are approximately at 4.5mm (actually extends into the aorta slightly) and 3.5mm. He was referred to USC, where the surgeon stated that he would like to wait several months to see if they aneurysms have grown. Now I understand that there is a measurement of around 5mm of more, that elects the patient for surgery. But seeing as they are almost 5mm, isn't it slightly counterproductive to wait for them to GROW? And if they haven't grown within the next several months, what do you suspect his next move is, watchful waiting? Surgery?? I understand possible complications of the surgery can be serious, but isn't the mortality rate of hemmorhage worse?  Wouldn't it be best (in a sense) to get them while they are smaller?

So I ordered the death certificate, I have no idea what was the matter - the underlying cause of the sudden bereavement.  But I find I cannot understand the detail of the death certificate. Can anyone help please? The certificate gives as the cause of death: a)   - senile calcific aortic valve stenosis and mitral valve stenosis and b) Multiple lung metastases from adenocarcinoma colon. 'Heart failure' I sadly of course understand, but not the rest. Still perplexed though, I spoke to my relative on the hospital phone and she gave me the 'ok', a year later I learn she suffered heart failure, presumably at the same hospital? Sorry about the bleak nature of this enquiry. Thank you. 0 likes, 2 replies "

Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/8cms-aneurysm-taa-and-still-waiting-of-treatment-677580,8cms Aneurysm (TAA) and Still Waiting of Treatment,"HI Folks I was diagnosed with an 8cms diameter Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm (that’s bigger than a coke can) at the end of July in Cheltenham General. The small amount of research I’ve done suggests that anything greater than 5.5cms requires urgent attention. Cheltenham immediately sent my details to Bristol Royal (BRI) who did not respond with anything meaningful for nigh on a week. The BRI called me in for another CT scan and gave me an appointment to see a consultant on the 28th of September. That will be 9+ weeks since diagnosis and I haven’t even got a sniff of a date for surgery. So it seems to me that Bristol Royal are dragging their feet meanwhile I could rupture at anytime and that would “Good Night Vienna” for me. Therefore I have asked to be referred to the Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital, as they seem to have an enviable reputation in this field along with the Royal Brompton, and this is now underway. I think it’s fair to say that I’m quite anxious. Have any of you guys out there got an aneurysm in the region of 8cms? If so what's happening with you? How are you coping? or am I being unnecessarily alarmist? I’m really quite worried. Regards, Phil. 0 likes, 38 replies "

Have others who survived aortic dissection had the same kind of problems getting information from and getting questions answered by your doctors?

I had LIS surgery along with 3 banded hemorrhoids on October 18th 2018. It took about 2 full weeks to be completely pain free and then I had to stop taking the stool softeners. I kept up drinking 100 oz of water a day as well as taking Metamucil fiber supplements every morning. I noticed the fiber was making too much volume for me to properly expel during bowel movements, leading me to strain and causing a lot of pain from the surgery sites. The pain was still tolerable compared to the fissure I had previously, but I’d like to live as pain free as possible. I did some research and saw that taking 500 mg of magnesium citrate can mimic stool softeners and is safe to take everyday (unlike the sennacot I was taking after surgery). I also consulted my physician. I stopped taking the fiber all together and started on the 500mg of magnesium citrate, taken at night before bed. To my absolute delight the magnesium, along with my usual 100 oz of water throughout the day, worked marvelously. I have soft, easy to go bowl movements every morning now with no straining and no pressure. It has literally changed my life and I wanted to share with those who may need help with softer bowel movements without using stimulant   or osmotic laxatives. 1 like, 0 replies "

TL/DR: itchy anus. no sex. What are those wrinkles? 29 year old male.  Almost no sexual activity, always protected.  never had anal sex. I've had, for the past 2 years,  an itchy anus. I noticed it happens like an hour before I have to poop, until a while after I do it. A few months after this started, I went to a regular doctor and asked; she said there was nothing wrong. But, even though I had never seen my anus before this, I'm pretty sure those wrinkles are not good. Also It makes wiping harder and painful. Theres not pain nor bleeding when I poop or wipe, but the problem it that sometimes the itching is so bad I have to scratch (with toilet paper), and I have scratched to the point of hurting myself, which lead to unbearable itchiness.

Having bowel movements was like passing shreds of glass & the pain was so bad for hours afterwards. I would wake up the next day dreading the next bowel movement. I actually thought it was piles & didnt know what it was until after about 8 weeks. The doctor gave me the usual creams etc and it did seem to work for a few days but then would come back. I finally was able to somewhat control the pain but the fissure wasnt healing. After reading everything I could about it & peoples trials & errors I wanted to share with you what finally healed the fissure. Please note I have no medical experience and I am just sharing what worked for me.  First drink lots of water. I drink 12-14 8oz glasses everyday. I ensure I have fibre with all my meals. For 1 week I had a sitz bath with epsom salts in it & use to soak in it for 20 mins. At night before bedtime I took 30ml of Cremaffin stool softner for about 1 month. I know this is too long to be taken this as well as too much but this used to make bowel movements pain free. Afterwards I gradually reduced 5ml every 2 weeks. But what really healed the fissure itself was applying Sudocrem nappy rash cream. I applied it gently (with very short nails to make sure I didnt scratch myself further!!) just inside my anus as well as around the tag.  I read that zinc oxide would help it heal and remembered my sons Sudocrem. I used to apply it about 4-5 times a day for about 1 week then reduced to 2 times a day. So far its been about 2 weeks and I have been pain free. I still take Cremaffin 10 ml every night & apply Sudocrem before bed. I hope this will help someone else too as cos as you know its the worst pain ever!! 5 likes, 49 replies "

Anal Fissure and Proctalgia,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/how-to-cure-anal-fissure-quickly--270871,HOW TO CURE ANAL FISSURE QUICKLY...,"Hi Everyone - I can tell you how to cure Anal Fissure's quickly... Firstly, my experience was horrible just like everyone else. I have read that it can be more painful than childbirth! Mine started from an overly large bowel movement that ripped me in 3 places. The pain was so bad that i passed out on my bathroom floor with blood and feecies hanging out of me when i woke up. The doctor gave me suppositories and anasthetic cream but nothing was working. I have concucted a reigime that has cured it in nearly three days. When i read on forums that it can take a few weeks i said to my self 'There is no way im living with this pain for that long'! EVERYTHING HURTS.... Sneezing, Laughing, Coughing, Walking, Sitting, Lying down... the list goes on... follow these steps and it cleared up 3 days. 1. Your going to need a few things from the shop - The first is Anusol Cream (despite people saying its not as good as preperation H and other stuff its has worked wonders for this reigime and is designed for anal fissures and hemeroids. The second is COCONUT OIL (MAGIC STUFF).... Anchient chinese cultures still use this to heal wounds of all kinds and this really was the turn around stuff for me. Thirdly... Ibuprofen for temporary pain relief and lastly Dulcolax tablets... I will show you how to use all these products for a quick repair in a minute... 2. Psychology ... DO NOT sit at home and wollow in pain and sadness. Go to work, see your friends, live a normal life but be careful. Positive mentality keeps you relaxed and promotes healing. When i was at work i barely felt any pain because i was so distracted, but when i was at home it was constant pain. Make sure you do this, im certain this has really helped. Also do not be affraid to tell people exactly whats wrong with you, i have found great amusment talking to people about it and 6/7 of the people i spoke to had been sufferers too, its nice to know your not the only one and you can see them well and happy! Here is my reigime that saved me: 1. The night before take 1-2 of the Dulcolax, it doesnt kick in until the morning but you need this so you dont damage yourself further. It is not a laxative it makes it all soft and squidgy and it just falls outta you. Minimal pain. 2. In the morning your gonna need to have a bowel movement, before you do. Run a bath and put a few table spoons of cocnut oil in it. (hot bath), then have your bowel movement. Mine was too painful to wipe so as soon as i finished i hopped in the bath and the water IMMEDIATELY relives the pain (BLISS).. and the coconut oil moisturises and heals. Stay in there for a good 10-20 minutes and then i promise you it wont be hurting as much now so now you can apply the anusol cream.  3. Before you head off to work or start your day, take 2 ibuprofen. After all this, it will sting a little but by day 3 you can barely feel anything.  4. Make sure you take your ibuprofen after breakfast, lunch and dinner. I had high fibre cereal for breakfast, water all day normal lunch and whatever for dinner.  5. Make sure you re-apply cream if you have a bowel movement during the day. I tried to just have one in the morning so i could not aggrovate my anus too much.  6. After dinner, take your ibuprofen, run a bath with coconut oil and just sit and relax for as long as you can (make sure you put NOTHING in your bath except the cocnut oil as soaps and stuff can dry you out and make it worse). 7. Before bed, take your dulcolax again drink plenty of water and get good nights sleep. This regime has fixed me in 2 1/2 days pretty much which i found amazing (i think it was the cocnut oil, which stings like a bitch but is AMAZING, i doesnt numb pain but it promotes healing). I am so pleased to be living a normal life again so quickly as i thought i would never be the same again. It is really important you dont fester at home doing nothing as it will only make it worse, go out, see the world and forget that its there.  Hope this helps people as it has really helped me and i wanted to share this with others.  Hope you all feel better soon! Keep smiling and never give up!! Peace & Love 28 likes, 470 replies "

At the time I was feeling lethargy and run-down. I mentioned my symptoms to my Mother who said she had suffered similar symptoms when she was younger and got diagnosed with anaemia and recommended iron supplements. On the advice of a pharmacist I started taking the ferrous sulphate tablets and my symptoms went away overnight. I felt generally much better, more focused and and not lethargic at all. Fast forward a year or so, I went to my GP to see if I could get a an actual anaemia diagnosis to get the pills on prescription. I had a blood test and to my surprise the test came back negative for anaemia. I stopped taking the FS pills a good few years ago and had actually forgotten about them, but again recently have been feeling incredibly lethargic and nothing had been making me feel better. I recently started taking the FS pills again and again an immediate improvement, no lethargy; far more alert; getting a lot more done in the day and feeling much happier. So my question is, does anyone have a similar experience. Can an anaemia diagnosis be missed in a blood test & should I keep self-medicating if it seems to be working.

Amlodipine,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/amlodipine-is-not-banned-in-the-netherlands-676575,Amlodipine is not banned in the Netherlands,"I felt compelled to register on this site so i could post informatien here. I have been taking Amlodipine for almost 10 years now. I sometimes experience very light dizziness, light pain in the left ankle and occasional itching. Other than that this medication is okay. I LIVE IN THE NETHERLANDS and this drug has never been banned. I do not know how this information came to exist. I take 5 mg of this drug and it reduces my readings. I will caution people to not under estimate their diagnosis. If Amlodipine does not help then try something else. There are many drugs out there. I started with Hydrochloorthiazide and that was aweful. I suffered from terrible tinnitus as a result and had to stop it after discovering the culprit. Amlodipine does not cause me this issue. I have been experiencing hair thinning since 5 years ago, I'm not sure if this is due to ageing or it's to blame on this drug. All i know is i'm over 50. So to everyone in general, please don't give up, find a drug that helps you. Side effects will aways exist on whichever drug you take, but it must feel bearable. Afterall it's better to treat your symptoms than not doing anything and ending up with a full blown heart attack or stroke.  0 likes, 4 replies "

I have benefited so much from the posts in the forum .. thanks ... I like to post a simple narration for those who are coming off it and share the experience or nightmare ... It seems there are those with immediate bad effects with days of taking Am and those whose symtoms develop over months ... as long as 6 mths to even several years .. I like to think that everyone will have a threshold .. where below that...one always assume is natural aging .. balance issues . Etc etc .... and once the symptoms cross that threshold .. you start to be very miserable and anxious ..  so .. it may be that those who like me suffer after 6 mths ... actually have the issues but below the misery threshold.. and start to become bad to worse after 6 mths .....? This also complicated by other medications taken.....? I think there are 2 groups of side effects .. 1. Primarily due to the drug in the system .. like the mental issues .. brain fog .. memory ... depression .. feelings of doom ...nauseous.. inability to think ... and 2 . Secondary due to the effects of the calcium mechanism altered by the drug itself ..possibly the aches .. pains ... joints.. leg swells.. etc etc etc....more physical stuff.. When Am is stopped ... based on the half like calculations.. it takes approx 12 days to clear the system... mainly most sufferers report an easing of the mental issues ....see a relief of the brain fog etc etc . However .. the physical issues seem to linger on and return on and off for some period of time .. definitely easing off in intensity and frequency .. but tapering off very slowly ... This is my simple interpretation from the informative inputs and I wonder if there is a general concurence ? Regards to all.... 4 likes, 68 replies "

Amlodipine,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/amlodipine-swelling-of-feet-difficult-to-walk-35744,"Amlodipine – swelling of feet, difficult to walk","I am aged 55, male, and I suffered a stroke five years ago, with a loss of much of my eyesight.  I find these days that even the slightest stumble, for example hitting an uneven paving slab, can cause my feet to swell up badly. Three weeks ago, I was unable to walk, and could only get around the house by hands and knees. I am gradually starting to walk again, but only slowly and with great care. After previous episodes, I have been unable to walk quickly. I have found, after a visit to the GP, that Amlodipine has a common side-effect of causing swelling in the feet. She seemed to be of the point of view that since it is only a side-effect, it does not really matter. She suggested that it would be a good idea to keep my feet up. Since for fortnight I could not walk, and found it uncomfortable for me even to sit up, this all seemed like a banal statement of the obvious. I was on 10mg of Amlodipine. I have not dared to try this again since, and now my mobility is gradually improving. I find it horrifying that this dangerous drug is routinely prescribed. If approximately a tenth of patients prescribed this drug have suffered from abnormal swelling of the feet, and other extremities (peripheral edema), and if many others suffer from other nasty side-effects, the cure seems worse than the illness. Surely there must be less aggressive drugs? 0 likes, 17 replies "

I also heard that they can give you blurred vision which sounds unappealing to me because I'm already getting strange vision symptoms and the last thing I want is for them to get worse.

I read online to take it around 12 hours before you need to be up in the morning to reduce grogginess so the next night I took it a bit earlier in the evening around 8. Around 12 I decided to lay down and try to sleep. Almost immediately it was like my mind started to fall asleep even before my body while I was still in the process of moving around a bit. I opened my eyes and in the darkness of my room I was seeing patterns of different images. I was understandably terrified and half asleep. I sat up in bed and turned all the lights on which stopped the hallucination but it took me quite a while to calm down and go back to sleep afterwards. Tonight after experiencing the tiredness all day again I took the pill again. I am waiting for the doctor to call back and tell me what I should do ( maybe if my body gets used to the pill the tiredness and weird hallucinating will stop?).

Amitriptyline,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/came-off-of-this-evil-drug-cold-turkey-sharing-my-journey--665665,Came off of this evil drug cold turkey. (Sharing my journey),"(Sorry for bad English) So, I had no problem at all except some sleep problems. A dude told me to take this whenever I needed to sleep. Note that I live in Turkey and here you can find this drug almost everywhere without prescription for a single dollar. I went and got a bottle of 10mg pills without any prescription and started taking them. I was clueless what it was and that it might have withdrawal symptoms. ( In fact taking   seriously is a Western thing. We don't believe it exists. My grandpa always would say that depression comes with bad life decisions and goes away when you fix your life) Long story short, I would take the pill every now and again and it was very good for I could sleep very easily when taking it. I would take it sometimes once a week and sometimes everyday (not always cuz I normally can sleep by myself). Last time I just got a 25mg cuz 10 wouldn't work anymore. I would sometimes just stop taking them for a long period. Noticed some mood swings and anger and just worrying about everything and decided to stop it a month ago. I did stop taking them and threw all of them out. I was okay up to 15 days and then I experienced first panic attack in my life. (I am a teacher and had to leave my class) I started reading about it and found out that I should've tapered down, but since I hadn't been taking them regularly I just didn't buy that. First week after symptoms appeared was the most horrible week of my whole life. Horrible panic attacks and   attacks, stomach upset and nausea,  . Now it's been almost 15 days after symptoms appeared and more than a month after my last dose. I feel much better. My stomach upset is getting better and I experienced no panic attacks last week. Anxiety is still there tho. Simply when some slight thing happens I get anxious. Like when my girlfriend goes out alone to a crowded or stressful place, I get panicked, or when I call my sister and she, for whatever reason, doesn't pick up first time, I start concentrating on bad possibilities and become very very anxious. I have been unable to take elevator, train, even buss for the first week, but yesterday I forced myself to travel to another city by train and I did. I felt so bad and almost got off in the middle of nowhere, but just kept going and did it. After doing that I felt very very very good like I achieved an amazing thing in life. Sorry for a lot of detail, I thought I need to do that so some people can get help from my experience. I also have no appetite at all and lost 20 pounds, but noticed some serotonin surge in the last couple of days when I mysteriously started laughing and feeling super good again (which is a good sign), but it went away. In general, I feel much better. My stomach is less upset and slowly starting eating bigger portions. My anxiety is mild now and hope it all goes away soon. I also take multivitamins and vitamin D and Omega 3 and B-complex. I also bought what they call serotonin precursor (5-htp) or something like that. I haven't taken 5-htp yet tho. I really am terrified of manipulating my serotonin again and messing with it. Want to keep going that way and if it was unbearable, I might took that 5-htp. At the end, I want to say to ppl here that just stop taking it if you can. I didn't taper down and wouldn't. I'd rather suck it up all and get rid of it once for all. I will never EVER take any antidepressant for the rest of my life and also I, again, stop believing in anxiety and depression.  Believe in urself when you quit and remember that you'll get better if you persevere. Just let your body take care of its own problems. Best of luck to all and again sorry fir too much detail. 1 like, 14 replies "

Amlodipine,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/istin-amlodopine-misery--686421,ISTIN / Amlodopine misery... ,"I am looking to gather and share experiences of the drug Istin which is the brand name for Amlodipine. I am a self-employed musician/guitar teacher  in my mid-50's and have been on this horrendous drug for many years. Around 4 years ago I developed  what I could only describe as a bad cold / hangover feeling with varying degrees of  fatigue which slowly worsened until around 18 months ago when I started to feel absolutely terrible, some days almost unable to get out of bed. Admittedly overweight and a bad snorer, I do exercise every day and I am a Vegan ( a diet I consider to be the most healthy and positively ethical choice these days). After slowly and almost silently descending into what I would call premature old-age I was not myself, previously an outgoing, fun and upbeat guy had morphed into a depressive, negative, disinterested and irritable person. This situation had become so bad that I struggled to work and faced quitting my band of over 30 years! Thanks to the wonderful NHS, I have had over the past 18 months MRI scans, counseling for   and   , sleep tests,  , have seen endocrinologists, respiratory specialists, neurologists and almost know the entire staff on first-name terms at St Georges in Tooting 😉 A couple of issues have been found, slight enlargement of Pituitary Gland and I do have Barrett's oesophagus, the latter I did not link to my symptoms of tiredness and inability to think straight. The story is rather long and involved which has spiralled into often severe depression and feelings of total helplessness but I  want to share this experience as FINALLY I have had a ray of light shine through the dark, gloomy cloud that has hovered above my head for so long. After seeing several GP's at my local practice I recently saw a new doctor who seemed genuinely concerned at my situation which is not normal for a fairly healthy, young minded 50-something musician. To my surprise and unlike any doctor I have ever met, she said, 'try coming off Istin for 10-12 days, check your blood-pressure regularly and come back to see me"" I am now two weeks off this drug and I have started to feel better, it is like a heavy, cold, dark, oppressive  blanket has been lifted from my shoulders. I have more energy and am starting to laugh and joke once more. My blood pressure hasn't gone through the roof as I expected although I do keep an eye in it. I am aware that psychological issues may be at work here, it could be all in my mind. I am still on edge waiting for the next problem or bad feeling to occur, I am not sure what will happen next BUT I hope my story may encourage people in a similar situation to address this problem. After taking Amlodipine for many years with slight side-effects, it now strikes me that this drug can act negatively with ones body at different stages in life, or interact with new medications that have been introduced, it could be an interaction with Rivaroxoban, an anti coagulant medication I take that replaced the equally insidious Warfarin drug, I don't know.... all I do know is that after coming off Istin, I do FEEL BETTER! It seems a mighty waste of time, money and resources that Health Professionals do not look into the side effects of drugs, maybe the millions of permutations of drug- interaction are impossible to analyse and, after all we are all different. Thank God for our wonderful NHS and for sites such as this where we can share our experiences and hopefully, encourage others who are still suffering, often unnecessarily.

Amlodipine,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/stomach-and-digestive-problems-with-amlodipine-691449,Stomach and Digestive Problems with Amlodipine,"I was prescribed 5mg of Amlodipine by my doctor for hypertension just over four weeks ago (on 10th December 2018). Just ten days later, in order reduce my blood pressure further and quicker, the doctor prescribed a further 5mg to bring my daily dose to 10mg in total. Nine days later after a light late afternoon meal (30th December) I suffered a severe bout of nausea, stomach discomfort and flatulence. The stomach discomfort was mild - approximately around the area of my navel - but the flatulence moved down from my upper bowels right down to my lower ones over a period of several hours.  This problem continued day after day and I completely lost my appetite - indeed any meal often made me feel nauseous and thoroughly bloated and uncomfortable. I started to lose weight because I was eating little .. surviving a lot on bananas, rice, applesauce, toast and porridge - the usual foods for sensitive stomachs. This was very unusual because I very, very rarely got any digestive problems at all through my 70 years beforehand.  It always happened a few hours after my main meal in the middle of the day. Sometimes, during the day, I can walk this off, but sometimes I am left awake and suffering it night. Having read other posts on this forum and further information on Amlodipine, I deduced that the drug upset other people the same and was likely the source of the problem. So decided to stop (with the agreement of my doctor) who said that I was probably one of the unlucky 18% of patients who have serious and unacceptable side effects. I stopped the drug on 2nd January 2019, only 23 days after starting it, but even though I wasn't on it very long it seems to be taking an age to get out of my system and I am still suffering daily, although I find it will ease after a few hours having taken a rehydration drink. I understand the half-decay rate in the body of this drug is 30-50 hours, so assuming one is fit and healthy, and it should take around no more than 12 days (approx 12 x 50) to clear. But I am still waiting with little improvement. More than 2 weeks later, I still suffer.  I have read that some people have found it much long to get rid of, perhaps 2-3 weeks. Have others had the same experiences, please, and how long did it take them to eject this ‘poison’ from their body and feel and eat well again ? Thanks Ian 0 likes, 8 replies "

Amlodipine,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/this-can-be-a-dangerous-medication-beware--257391,This can be a dangerous medication - beware!,"I took 5mg of amlodipine without problems for about a month. After the first-week period of adjustment, in which it completely knocked me out, I felt normal again and was overjoyed that it lowered and kept my usual 150+/90+ BP down to a textbook 120/80 (with minor variation). But then side effects began to develop. I found my sleep increasingly poor, until I could only reach a half-sleep, no matter how much exercise I had had that day (or benadryls or Ambiens I took), ""twilight sleep"" I think it's called, and I arose as tired as when I went to bed, as if I hadn't slept at all. Then I noticed that I would suddenly have shoulder and upper back muscle pain within an hour of taking amlodipine. The doctor lowered my dose to 2.5mg of amlodipine plus 40mg of benazepril, which brought only temporary improvement. The painful muscle spasms returned.

I will   take this medication again. I believe it can lead to muscle pain, unrestorative interrupted sleep, and worse, strokes. I now consider it poison for me. By the way, amlodipine has been banned in the Netherlands and other countries because its dangerous negative side effects outweigh its benefits. I don't think the Dutch are arbitrary or capricious in their decisions - I   agree. This substance should be banned everywhere. 12 likes, 109 replies "

I know it will likely take a long time but I am very keen to know how long the wait is likely to be.  After many years of having all of the symptoms, for example, being pale, feeling the cold, easily getting ill, feeling exhusted most of the time, having heavy and painful periods, having heart  , etc. I decided to finally see the doctor with my list of symptoms. I have never had a blood test before and being 29 I thought this would be a good idea to check on things. My doctor informed me that I was severly iron deficient and therefore anemic. My number was 4 when it should be in the 20s. I was perscribed 3 iron tablets a day, take on an empty stomch with a high vit c drink and put onto the pill to lesson my periods. I have increased my diet with regrds to iron intake greatly, I avoid calcuim around the times I take my iron tablets and stopped drinking tea and coffee completely. I even eat meat now.

Amlodipine,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-recovery-story-from-the-misery-of-amlodipine-563393,"My ""recovery story"" from the misery of Amlodipine","I apologize in advance for the lengthy post. For a very long time, I had been suffering from a lot of intense aches and pains in my joints and muscles and was not able to get any proper diagnosis for it. I was beginning to very worried that I had some serious illness like cancer. Thanks to the posts in this site, I was able to pinpoint amlodipine as the source of my misery. I shall try to put as much details as I can regarding my own experience in journal form, in case it becomes helpful to others. Background: I am male, 40yrs old, former competitive swimmer and in good shape (apart from the hypertension which is genetic). I was placed on 5mg amlodipine after being diagnosed with hypertension 6 years ago. 5mg seemed to work fine with no side effects. In July 2016, I went to our local clinic due to a serious case of the flu. The GP on duty was not happy with my 130/90 and said that I should increase my dosage to 10mg. Thinking nothing of it, I complied but did not consult with my specialist. In hindsight, this is when my symptoms started to appear. Symptoms: It first started with muscle pain in my left forearm and joint pain in my left shoulder. I assumed that this was due to carrying my newborn baby in the same position for hours on end. These disappeared but then I suddenly started suffering pain in my hands and feet as if someone had taken a hammer to them. I felt like my bones were crushed. In December, pain in my knees and elbows followed. My knees felt swollen at the back while my elbows felt as if there was constant pressure on my funny bone. There wasn’t any actual swelling or inflammation, just the sensation of pain really. I then started to have muscle spasms at the beginning of this year. The spasms and twitching were almost constant at night. How amlodipine became a suspect: After researching everything from arthritis to cancer, I stumbled across this site and the symptoms posted seemed similar. So I figured, what the heck! Let’s give this a shot. So on 29-Jan, I decided not to take my medication and felt some relief almost immediately. My “recovery” is detailed in the journal below: Day 1 – 0mg. By the end of the day, muscle spasms stopped completely. Have not had any ever since. This was my first clue that amlodipine may be the culprit. Pain in my right knee completely disappeared with pain in my elbows and left knee lessening and not constant. Day 2 – 2.5mg – Afraid of rebound hypertension, I decided to still take 2.5mg. Pain in right elbow, completely gone. Less pain in left knee and elbow. Developed slight occasional shoulder pain though. Pain in right thumb and toes. Day 3 – 2.5mg – No more knee and right elbow pain. Though pain in left elbow remains but significantly less. Foot and toe pain greatly reduced. Day 4 – 5mg – Started getting a headache and uncomfortable feeling in left arm so I thought I could be getting hypertension again so decided to take 5mg. Slight pain in left index finger and right thumb. Slight occasional shoulder pain. Joints in elbows, shoulders, knees and ankles started popping and clicking. Day 5 – Back to 2.5mg – No more pain in elbows and knees. However, shoulder pain increased and developed lower back and hip pain. This was after I took the 2.5mg at mid-day. Also developed a stomach upset about ten minutes after taking it. Day 6 – 2.5mg – No knee and elbow pain. No pain in fingers and toes but have feeling of stiffness. Joints still popping and clicking.  Shoulder pain increased. Felt like stabbing pain. Something new is that the front of my neck felt sore and muscles felt swollen. Day 7 – 0mg Since it was the weekend and expected less stress, I decided to try and not take amlodipine. No pain in major joints. Neck and shoulders felt stiff and sensation of neck swelling still there but not constant. Day 8 – Still 0mg – Felt almost normal. Neck soreness was there upon waking but became negligible towards the afternoon. Day 9 (today) – Pain free!!!! Still some tightness in the neck from time to time but nothing like it was in the past days. In fact, it is non-existent as I type this. Observations – Symptoms seem to get worse before they get better for each joint. Improvement also seemed to start from the bottom and progress upwards with pain in the upper joint getting worse or appearing just as the bottom joint was feeling better. Example, as my knees were getting better, my left elbow pain got worse; and as my elbows were getting better, I started to develop pain in the shoulders and neck which I did not have previously. Conclusion – I am not sure if I shall be getting off amlodipine completely. I actually plan to take 2.5mg again for a few days and work my way back to my normal 5mg dosage. I did not have any side effects then. I do plan to go back to my specialist but he only comes in on weekdays and it is a problem for me to get time off from work.   Again, apologies for the length of this post but I do hope that it is able to help someone.  6 likes, 61 replies "
Amlodipine,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/anyone-experience-acid-reflux-while-on-amlodipine-norvasc--588071,Anyone experience acid reflux while on Amlodipine (Norvasc)?,"Hello, on the first of the year I woke up with  /tightness and some asthmatic like symptoms. I have a bicuspid aortic valve so I monitored my blood pressure which was slightly high and called my cardiologist who put my on 2.5mg of norvasc. Later on in the month I started having bad regurgitation. Called my GP and he told me to start taking 20mg of prilosec. I started to notice less regurgitation but in Feb I started to feel a sensation of a lump in my throat. I was then referred to a GI specialist. Had an endoscopy and was informed I had mild esophagitis. He told me to continue prilosec. No help. Beginning of march I had an esophageal manometry and 24hr pH study. Was informed my esophageal motility was low and was probably caused by continued reflux. Was informed to take prilosec twice a day. I've since continued to exercise, remain active and eat well. I'm 27, 5'4 and weigh 135 pounds. It is driving me crazy and I feel like I am not the prime candidate for these symptoms. I also noticed some swollen pockets on the top off my feet . Last week I read online that calcium channel blockers can cause reflux because it can relax the LES and allow acid into the esophagis. With the permission of my cardiologist I stopped taking the amlodipine on 4/19/2017. The first 4 days I felt terrible. High   and nerviousness with some weird feelings in my body. My blood pressure remained normal and those anxiety symptoms seemed to have went away. If the amlodipine was the cause of the reflux how long will it take the side effects to go away after taking it 4 months? I'm ready to feel normal again. The doctors seem to have no idea what could be causing this. This is the only thing I have to blame at the moment. 0 likes, 15 replies "

As the month progressed I started to get forgetful, dizzy spells, very tingly left hand and painful joints all througfh my left side. BP did not drop as fast as hoped so Doc added Lisinopril 2.5mg. Hey... off with the faries now! After two weeks I could not concentrate on anything people were telling me and to the point that I was becoming detached from the real world. And that was only after a couple of weeks on the cocktail. I decided to trial which drug was causing this and first removed the Lisinopril for a few days then swapped over to stopping Amlodipine. Cor.. what a difference. Almost the next day after stopping Amlodipine I started to recover. After just one week people at work are now saying 'welcome back'  and I know what they mean.

Anyway, I was at uni and going through a bad time in my life, whenever I get stressed my guts go into turmoil.  As a result I was off uni for a week with severe rectal pain and feeling lower than a snake's belly.  I booked an appointment with my GP as I had experienced similar symptoms before. My GP recognised the symptoms immediately, I thought I had piles, she said I was too young so had a look.  The digital examination wasn't fun, in fact she said she had never seen anyway change colour so quickly but it was worth it because I was refered to a colo-rectal surgeon. I took my sick note back into my tutor and as I was doing a clinical degree, he said straight away that fissures were worsened and sometimes caused by stress.  The penny dropped. As I said I was going through a very very bad time in my life which necessitated me going on antidepressants (Cipralex) for my emotional state.  When this was added to wall climbing agony due to fissures I was near breaking point.  I remember after one bowel movement almost fainting with the pain, I was lying at the top of the stairs at my mum's house and clawing at the wallpaper with my fingernails - I have had a broken leg and in terms of pain that fissure was far worse, trust me. I went to see the colo-rectal surgeon a few weeks later, I was terrified, but he was a lovely man, very very considerate. He told me that I had a large fissure that could be helped with an ointment.  I told him my background so he talked a bit more openly and said that fissures are an incredibly debilitating condition.  He once had a 16 stone rugby player openly weeping on his consulting couch with the pain - I can understand why. I was prescribed GTN ointment and started using it as directed.  I had a slight headache which I could live with, but this was far better than the agony of the fissure and this headache was pretty much gone after the first week. After a week of use the pain from the fissure had also subsided to nothing.  After six weeks I went back to the surgeon and I was healed. I wish that was the end of the story but it isn't, I have probably had four or five bad flare ups since and dozens of other twinges, spasms, bleeds and itches since but I am nowhere near as bad as the first time - I can live with this now.  I have seen the surgeon twice since and he has offered surgery but my frame of mind precluded me from that, I was simply terrified. My GP is very understanding and I can get GTN on prescription whenever I need it.  I was prescribed Anoheal by the surgeon as well but this didn't work as well as GTN for me, but I have seen cases in work where this has been incredibly effective. As I said earlier, I was doing a clinical degree, which I have now passed, so I feel that I am pretty well qualified to offer a bit of advice, so here it is. 1. Go and see your GP. Don't be embarrassed, your doctor has seen dozens of these -  they are very very common.  If you get fobbed off or feel that you haven't got anywhere, go back and tell him/her that you are not happy and you will go elsewhere i.e. change your GP.  Changing your GP hits their bank balance, and as GPs are notoriously greedy, they will do something.  Nobody should have to suffer with this.   2. Take something for the pain but NOT codeine.  Ibuprofen worked best for me. 3. Drink plenty of fluids and lay off the alcohol while you are healing. 4. Eat lots of fibre and fresh fruit and veg, switch to brown bread and have something like Weetabix for breakfast.  This softens stools and makes them easier to pass - less pain and less damage to existing fissures. 5. Use a stool softener, one Movicol sachet daily really really helped me.  You can buy these over the counter from your local Pharmacist but tell them what it is for.  Alternatively get them on prescription from your GP. 6. Lay off the red meat, there is some science to this as meat increases the residence time in the gut and predisposes to harder stools.  This really helped me and I have seen a few accounts here where sufferers also say that. 7. Try to relax, easier said than done, but try simple things like having a hot bath instead of a shower.  If anything helps you, no matter how crazy or off the wall it may sound, carry on doing it.  Going out for a drive helped me.  Staying active also helps constipation and makes you feel better.  Don't stay in and stew - stay positive. 8. Stick to the doctor's directions of any drugs you are given. If you are told to apply a cream for 6 weeks into the anus, then make sure it goes into the anus for 6 weeks.  And into the anus means into the hole - not nice, but a lot nicer than the agony from an untreated fissure. Remember you are not alone, these things can be cured.  You will feel terrible and you will feel like nobody else understands what you are going through but believe me, these things are very very common. And if all the above doesn't help there is a simple operation that can be done on a day case basis that has a 95% chance of curing it for good. If you are reading this you are no doubt feeling horrible but believe me, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Good luck with your pain in the ass. 13 likes, 208 replies "

Anaemia,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/anemia-cancer-scare-692202,Anemia cancer scare ,"Hi, I'm a 35 yr old female and I found out I was a little anemic and iron deficient at a regular checkup in July 2018. I mentioned to my dr I was having restless legs very bad and was slightly more tired than usual. She decided to test my ferritin. It came back extremely low at 5.2. My hemoglobin was down at 10.2. She had me start taking iron, initially childrens vitamins with iron but I later switched to Blood Builder (MUCH more effective). Now I started the copper iud 1.5 year ago, notorious for causing heavy periods. And from Dec 17-well last month when I had it removed- they were HEAVY. At least 3 times heavier than I had ever experienced. I also let my dr know that I had experienced rectal bleeding but had been to a different doctor a few months prior to address. They said probably just my hemorrhoids and did a stool test which tested negative. My current dr said, ok glad you went and to let her know if it kept up. Well it did, and in September she wrote a prescription and gave specific advice on how to control them. To keep the story short, I was eventually referred to a colorectal surgeon for further investigation, she found lots of hems and a fissure (joys of childbirth), but due to my anemia has scheduled a  . She said ""all of those things can certainly cause anemia, but we are seeing an increase in young people with colorectal  "" !! what a terrifying thing to tell someone who is   prone. My hemoglobin is great, now at 13.6, and my ferritin is slowly but surely building back up. BUT I can't get out  of my mind that the bleeding isn't something more sinister. If I hadn't experienced anemia this year she likely wouldn't have insisted on a colonoscopy since there were obvious sources of bleeding. Basically, finding the iron deficiency has felt like a domino effect of feeling that my health is failing and that I may have cancer. I have never had any health issues in my life until this. Additionally, I feel like I'm in a vicious cycle, because the Blood Builder pills, while not too hard on the stomach, still cause things to be a little harder than normal, therefore never improving  my other issues. I am very anxious and looking for experiences/ advice! 0 likes, 1 reply "

It provided a little relief but didn’t heal the fissure. My colorectal surgeon in Toronto eventually offered the LIS surgery as he said it was unlikely to heal after such a long time. I was very hesitant to do that surgery as I’ve read about possible complications and being in my early 30’s I didn’t want to risk it. I researched and found the Kenalog procedure. Where the fissure is cleaned out, cauterized and injected with kenalog steroid. No cutting of muscle so not worry about being incontenet. The only doctor to do it is Dr. Feingold who invented this alternative to LIS in New York City.  I contacted the hospital that he works at and got my colorectal surgeon in Toronto to provide me with all my documentation regarding my condition.  I sent it to the hospital via global services and after a fairly long process (4 months) I got word that Dr Feingold was willing to take my case. I flew to New York and had the procedure done yesterday. So far I’m in very little pain and am optimistic that the procedure will be a success.

My episodes were about 6x/year earlier, but thankfully are down to about one per year. The attacks can be incredibly painful, and scary with the worst ones, you feel like you’re going to pass out.  After suffering through these for four years, I discovered something that consistently gives me very fast and complete relief. It’s a hot bath the hottest you can stand. And while you are waiting for the tub to fill (you only need 2-3 inches of water), apply a washcloth, soaked in hot water, to your anus. Stay in the bath until the pain is completely gone. Run more hot water if necessary.  As for cause, a couple times it has come on after ejaculation, but mostly it comes on while sleeping. My theory is that there is a stool in close proximity to the anal sphincter that cause the sphincter to spasm. So I think there is a correlation between the episodes and mild  .  That said, though the episodes often are accompanied by the strong sensation of needing to poop, don’t try! The sphincter is in no condition to permit a bowel movement during spasm. If anything, trying to poop lengthens the episode.  Other tips - lying on side is better than on back; passing gas, if you can, helps a little, anti-  meds (e.g., Ativan) help, but not nearly as fast as the bath; deep breathing helps take focus off the pain. This is as close as I’ll ever get to childbirth!  Some consolation no matter how long or painful the episode is, it will not kill you and it WILL pass.  Good luck! 2 likes, 10 replies "

Since maybe September of 2018, I've been having a sharp pain and itchiness in my anal area post-bowel movement. It wasn't that painful at the time, I would just poop as normal and then clean the area with witch hazel and call it a day.  Then in February, after a bout of   the pain got worse, it felt like I was passing razor blades, with little streaks of blood on the toilet paper and I feared having to use the bathroom! I thought it was hemorrhoids so I just used more witch hazel and soaked the area with a warm towel and eventually, the pain and bleeding subsided, and I got back into my university work.  Coming down to the end of March, I went through an emotionally stressful time, as I had lost a dear pet and still had to commit to my assignments. The Sunday afterwards, I went to the bathroom, expecting a normal, peaceful poop, and to my shock not only was it the most sharp, painful bowel movement I've had in my life, there was a LOT of fresh bright red blood coming out on the toilet paper, which scared the heck out of me. It's been like this since then, with the exception of last weekend when I had mild   and had very soft stools courtesy of diarrhea.  Right now, I'm waiting on my period to end so I can see my doctor, but I was wondering if there was anything I could do in the meantime aside from changing diets and sitz baths( which I'm already doing) to try to lower the post- BM bleeding at least, because that's what's freaking me out the most.

This post is not to scare off anyone but to share my own experiences with Dr Feingold's AF surgery.  He is still an awesome Surgeon as far as I am concerned.  I know He and his nurses will to everything they can to help. Before my surgery he told me again I have a 85% chance of a successful healing due to my size and health issues. unfortunately I am disabled from Spinal Stenosis which leaves me suffering in pain in my upper and lower body. All this added hardships has taken its toll and of course little to zero quality of life.

I am no expert but keeping stress down, diet, sitz bath, medication,  supplements will help as far as I know. No One way will work since what worked for one person is only subjective to that person's healing. At least we get some direction to cure this Hellish wound.

I've been suffering from an anal fissure since 11/2018 -currently. it initially started due to a hemorrhoid a develop in 11/2018 due to some constipation, the hemorrhoid was so bad got thrombosed that I went to the ER and got it sliced open (great awesome no,more painful hemorrhoid) however I know that the ER doc must have cut me other places by accident or because he was in a rush. my PCP diagnosed me with anal fissure shortly after. *now- quality of life is poor, I haven't been able to work due to this. *I can't stand, can't sit, can't drive. *I'm losing ton of my hair from all the pain that I feel, all the trauma that I feel. *passing stool is debilitating to the point of almost fainting, it is one of the worse pain in the world. *I bleed everyday *the spasms, stabbing & burning pain is present everyday. *I cannot enjoy life anymore, all I think is about the pain and the next bowel movement. *my pelvic region has been suffering so much due to the painful spasms, stabbing needdle-like pain that recently I can no longer hold my urine. that area is completely exhausted from all the pain and spasms and my urine leaks out, sometimes all of it, I went to buy briefs recently. I take briefs and extra pants plus a portable bidet everywhere I go (I don't use toilet paper and I got a real bidet At home) *the pain is something I don't wish on anybody! and I've been through kidney stones, gallbladder rupture, childbirth x2 , and this tops the list easily. I can't do this anymore guys, I can't stand the pain. I have an appointment with the surgeon late April (this month) my GI doctor referred me still waiting for my insurance to approve the nitroglycerin ointment , it's $798 dollars if they don't approve. the pain is described as someone cutting me open very deeply and me feeling the torture pain of it all 100% . then that someone adding a combination of lemon, salt and alcohol and hot salsa and filling up the fresh open body parts with it! 😭 I don't know how to live like this! I don't know if surgery or rectiv cream will change a thing. I have 2 beautiful children whom I can't even give my best time with because with every step there's pain. my life has stopped. but the pain increases. I wish others knew what I feel when I tell them how debilitating this is. I wish this would go away God help me please. 1 like, 10 replies "

Now i recently learnt that saw Palmetto, L-Licene and Lycopene can help in hair fall.

If anyone has any suggestions or info please please please do share. As only a person who is loosing hair and turning ugly day by day can only understand the pain of loosing hair  Please if anyone has any info about this do share it. I previously thought that if hair follicles become weak then it remains like that and eventually dies. But saw Palmetto has given me some hope.

I’m 18. I always have had issues related to scalp from my early childhood (Since I was 14). To be precise I had ""Seborrheic dermatitis"". That problem is not gone yet & I have suffered a lot for that. The itching would be so painful that I would stop by the road during cycling and rub my head using nails like a madman. I would stay inside home and cry for this. This was so severe that I frequently got distracted my studies and was never actually able to concentrate on them. Went to many doctors but everything failed. Finally using Aloe Vera on my own has significantly reduced the itchiness and I barely touch my scalps nowadays.  Unfortunately, I have lost a heck lot of hair for that disease. Excessive dandruff coupled with my roughness with the scalps has literally ruined my hair. I have given up and both my hair and confidence have fallen apart.  This evening, I decided to check the crown of my head. The pictures I clicked would've terrified anyone but I don't have anything to lose. I had shampooed last Thursday and lost more than 30 hairs during that. I am calm and just wanna know how severe this thinning of my crown is. I want you to rate the severity of the baldness. On the scale of 1-10, what would you rate? I have shot them from five different angles.. Pardon me if you find those awfully shaky. But they are visible still.

I was 25 male at the time. At the time I had a long mop, and I was just about to wash my hair because it was greasy and the light is less than a foot above my head in the bathroom mirror. I panicked I was using a 2 for 1 shampoo and conditioner conbination shampoo which I had used for years. But because I panicked I brought and tried many different shampoos I brought -A Caffeine shampoo that is meant to stop hairloss over a period of about 4-6 weeks I would wash my hair nearly everyday. I first used the thickening shampoo but did not see any difference so brought the caffeine shampoo, I used as the instructions said and would wash my hair nearly everyday. every time I used it, i would my scalp tingle like itwanted to be itched. but I ignored it. It also made my hair feel rough. I used it for about 2-3 weeks, The tingling would really peak if I was sweaty.  I ran my hand through my hair and noticed a lot of dandruff fall. I aksed my mum to look and said that looked like dandruff and some of my scalp looked red. I stopped using that everyday and started using an anti itch scalp shampoo until the redness had gone away. I also looked onlinewhat else could help so I brought and anti residue shampoo and used that. then used the anti itch shampoo after as that is what the instructions said. However, the shampoo did make my hair feel soft but it made the dandruff worse and the itchiness was bad as well. I used the anti itch shampoo for a few days a week and the caffeine shampoo the rest ofthe time. I decided to get haircut, I went from long mop to short mop with the idea to go shorter each haircut. i noticed around this point that my hair was getting greasy the day after washing so I was washing everyday still but was mainly using the anti itch shampoo. But was everyday In April I did not wash my hair for around 5-7 days as  I had nothing on and try to gain  a bit if balance back. I decided to wash my hair 3 times a week, Monday, wed and fridays, saturdays only if something was happening. My hair would get greasy so I guessed I had done some damage to it and brought a repair shampoo and conditioner with keratin in it and is smelt really nice. In May I started therapy for depression, something I have battled for years, the sessionswere on a Tuesday, and I did not want to risk having greasy hair going to see her so I swapped the days from  monday to Tuesday and then would wash my hair either wed or thursday. I would use the repair shampoo and conditioner on the Tuesday amd then just a shampoo inbetween then on the friday a little bit of anti residue shampoo and sometimes just shampoo sometime repairshampoo and conditioner. I did notice that after using the conditioner on the second day my hair did look dull and sort of greasy If I remember correctly I started to grow my hair out as well and just wash my hair on Tuesday and Fridays and if I was going out special. This continued through the summer months and then I swapped the shampoo and conditioner to a different one as I had ran out. I continued to just use the shampoo Tuesday and Fridays and use the conditioner on Tuesday and experimented when to use the conditioner and how. After I finished therapy in October, probably in November I ran out of the conditioner and just used the shampoo, I noticed depending on what I did my hair did not look as bad as if I had used the conditioner on the second day I would use a brush which I would try and clean every so often, but I think my brother was using it as well. I did not have a haircut from November ish to march as I was trying to grow my hair out. I ended up getting a bit fed up with the longer hair as it was not growing that much or appeared to be growing really slowly so in March I had it cut to a short mop. By the second day I have noticed my hair does look greasy. Probably from last year I would ""scrub"" on my scalp with my finger tips to try and clean it when I amusing the shampoo. Could I have been causing too much oil to be produced? I have also brought a comb I have stopped using a conditioner. I am washing 2-3 times a week I am using an anti dandruff shampoo called vosene medicated to help with the dandruff,  however I did always find that made my hair rough compared with the 2for1 shampoo think it was called wash&go but that couldve made my hair feel a bit better because it had conditioner in it as well What other options can I take to try and make my hair less greasy? and less ""dandruffy"" Could it just be that my hair is naturally greasy and needs more washing and that it is not as thick or as long as it once was it takes more washing? Could also change pillow cases more often help? 0 likes, 3 replies "

So I bought Magnesium Glycinate and take 200mg in the Morning along with 500mg Of Taurine about an hour after I have taken One a Day multivitamin and Probiotic.  What I have found Is Im having really loose stools, and I bought the Glycinate because it was supposed to not upset the stomach... But I'm going to the Bathroom Immediatly when I get up from bed and usually again 2-3 more times during the day.. Its not really diarrhea but loose stool, the morning seems to be more normal. But as the day goes on they are really ribbon thin, and then sometimes Diarrhea..  I've also just recently switched to a Gluten Free/Dairy Free Diet .. Im just concerened about the stools being so thin.. but wondering if this is the Magnesium causing this or another issue? I have an appit with a GI doctor in about a month, for another issue I have been having with a feeling like something is always stuck in my throat/back, but have no heartburn etc... and after research I believe i may have LPR... so this complicates things more for me.. (( since PPI and antacids etc deplete magnesium)) Also after taking the Magnesium i seem to have a ""spaced out"" feeling and some lightheadedness... Just wondering if anyone else out there has experienced this and how to fix it? Should I just go to the oil? or Try the Malate? Im not sure./...confused 0 likes, 39 replies "

I'm begging any of you to take a look at the below and let me know of any insight that you can possibly provide on the matter.  Over the last four months, I have been experiencing a wide range of strange and disturbing symptoms. I have not found any answers from a traditional healthcare standpoint and decided to reach out to you to see if you've heard of anything like this. Below, I will outline the symptoms that I have been experiencing along with the tests that I have done from a traditional healthcare standpoint. Again, ANY help that you can provide on this would be greatly appreciated. I have a young daughter at home and really need to start getting better.  [ ]   Symptoms:  Frequent Heartburn - I've never struggled with heartburn before this. This causes a burning in my chest and tightness in my throat.  Chest Pains  Muscle Twitching - Body-Wide... This comes and goes and can be felt anywhere, especially in my legs.  Muscle Coordination/Off-Balance - I feel like my hands are not coordinated and that my balance is off, though when I test my balance, etc... I seem to be fine.  Muscle Soreness - This comes and goes and is not brought on by a specific activity.  Heavy Anxiety/Doom Feelings - These seem to not really be brought on by anything in specific.  Random Skin Rashes/Tingling Mouth - I do not have any allergies that I am aware of and this is a newer symptom.  Frequent Belching and Gas  Urinary Slowness and Frequent  Vision Floaters  Heavy fatigue after eating  Mouth Sores/Blisters  Hypersensitive Nerves - Water drops are very noticeable, etc.  Fine Motor Functions Appear to be fine  Traditional Healthcare Checks:  Heart Echo and Stress Test - Clear  Endoscopy and Celic/HPylori Screen - Clear  Neuro Exams x2 - Clear and no muscle weakness  Lyme Disease and Western Blot - Clear -  s  Rhumotoidologist Exam - Clear  Endocrinologist - Ordered 7-Day Glucose Monitor and Testosterone Check.  Diabetes Blood Tests - Clear  Chest X-Ray - Clear  EKG - Clear  ANA Test - Mild Positive  Blood Sugar and C-Pep Tests - Mildly Off - Investigating Further  CBC Tests - Clear  Brain MRI - Clear  Spine MRI - Clear  Brain CT Scan - Clear  EEG - Clear  Lupus Blood Test - Negative  Inflammation Rate Blood Tests - Negative  STD Tests - Negative  Heavy Metals Blood Test - Negative  Vitamin Blood Tests - Negative  Parasite Stool Test - Negative  Vitamin Tests - All Fine - Except Low D  Kidney and Liver Blood Tests - Clear  Celiac Blood Test - Positive but then Endoscopy Negative for it.  I've basically learned to live with these symptoms at this point but I feel like things are getting worse. I keep getting told that I am find but I know that I am not. I find myself missing things sometimes when trying to grab something/missing keyboard keys, getting random rashes, etc. The most disturbing is the muscle twitching that can occur anywhere on my body.  I am getting nowhere with traditional medicine at this point and I feel that doctors are scratching their heads. I've done so many tests so it is hard to argue with them but I also know that the symptoms are still present and persistent. Really the only thing that we have to go on is a positive ANA test but the Rhumologist says that I am fine.  My diet and exercise patterns have always been excellent and I do not take any medication.  I'm really very troubled by everything and am desperate at this point.  I would really appreciate any information that someone can provide on my issues.  Thank You, 0 likes, 11 replies "
Alternative and Complementary Medicine,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/lichen-sclerosus-cured-but-it-took-work--36244,Lichen Sclerosus cured - but it took work.,"I started having symptoms of LS when I was 23 years old (from what I can remember). It got progressively worse until I was finally diagnosed at 26. I did a ton of research and started seeing two alternative doctors about it. The symptoms gradually disappeared, and I have been symptom free for about 6 months. Based on all my research, it seems like the underlying cause varies from person to person, but I will briefly summarize what I believe were contributing factors in my case.  1.) Uncomfortable sex and/or sexual abuse. There is evidence that sexual abuse can cause LS, although I'm not sure if it causes or exacerbates the problem. Either way, my symptoms got a lot worse when I was in a relationship with a man who I was not very attracted to. My only advice (really, whether you have LS or not) is to not have sex if you have symptoms, or if you simply do not want to. The friction physically damages the skin. 2.) Underlying inflammation, which can be caused by the following factors: a) infection. I had a bad one for a long time. At this point the LS symptoms were quite bad - lots of itching and pain, and shiny white patches. After getting a million tests done, I finally gave up on western doctors, went to see an alternative guy, and he gave me an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-viral herb (it was a strong herb). The symptoms started to clear up immediately, and I mean by the next day. I suspect it was a fungal infection because symptoms worsened several months earlier when I was on a round of antibiotics (antibiotics alone will kill the bacteria that keeps fungus and yeast at bay, permitting fungal overgrowth). Anyways, that helped, but the symptoms were still not completely gone. There were other contributing factors... b) Allergies. I got my alternative guy to test literally everything I ate on a regular basis, and it turned out I was sensitive or allergic to many foods. Dairy was the big  one, and when I cut it out, I noticed the symptoms mostly disappeared. At that point, I was sometimes asymptomatic but sometimes it still flared up a bit, which still drove me crazy, so I pressed on. c) Deficiencies. I had major deficiencies in iodine (this one was important.. I'll discuss it in my next point), vitamin E, zinc, vitamin B12, and I suspect several other things. I took supplements for a short period of time and majorly changed my diet. Now everything I eat is organic, and almost nothing is processed. I eat almost no restaurant food. Just a very natural diet - like how your grandmother would eat. It is a lot of work, but wow did it make a difference. The foods I noticed to be particularly helpful for LS are kale, swiss chard (both blanched to get rid of the oxalic acid), and bison/elk/organic beef. I also eat tons of yams and sweet potatoes. The pain and itching is completely gone. The only symptom I now have is mild follicalitis on one side which only comes up occasionally, and I'm not sure that is even related to the LS. 3.) One more thing. There seems to be a strong link between LS and hormones. As I said above, iodine was an important factor because I had subclinical hypothyroidism (this is very common). The problem is, when your thyroid gland isn't functioning properly, it throws your sex hormones out of whack. So if you are always tired and/or cold, then there is a good chance iodine supplementation might restore some hormonal balance. On top of the iodine, i also tried a couple herbs for hormone issues - black cohosh tea and raspberry leaf tea -  and found they both seemed to help with the LS and other symptoms I had. From all of this, if I could recommend anything, it would be this: first off, examine ALL your symptoms. Chances are, if there is something else going on, it is probably related and might give you a clue as to the underlying cause. Second, FIND AN ALTERNATIVE DOCTOR! The truth is, a western doctor cannot help you with this problem. I found that the naturopaths trained in North America were just as useless. The only two guys that I found who were able to help me had no formal credentials and practiced techniques that allowed them to 'get inside' my body and really figure out what was wrong. One did Muscle Response Testing and the other is simply able to 'feel' what is wrong when giving acupressure. Although these types of practitioners are less common in North America, I guarantee if you start asking around, you will find someone. If not, try going to some herb stores in your local Chinatown district, and they can often point you in the right direction.  I hope this helps! I was so hopeless when I first found out I had LS, but am now so happy I persevered in finding a solution. good luck to all who read this! 28 likes, 307 replies "

Alternative and Complementary Medicine,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/100-working-treatment-for-my-ibs--257543,100% WORKING TREATMENT for my IBS!,"100% WORKING TREATMENT for my IBS! Hi, I am writing this to try to help everybody that I can because I have been on the same boat as you guys and gone through this living hell for 3 years!!!  Short description about my previous case was that I could almost eat nothing, only eat what is normally designated for IBS menu, I was always feeling that I had to go to the Bathroom, I would have IBS-D attacks daily, even taking a lot of Imodium would not work totally, painful bowel cramps, the whole works… I could go on with the list…but you guys already know what are the symptoms from personal experience. Doctors give this autoimmune disease the name of IBS because they are totally clueless of why this happens, so they just grab all the symptoms and put them in one bag calling it IBS… to me it is just the doctors another way of saying they are clueless but they don´t want to show it to us so they won´t look bad. Dr. Pimentel who has come up with the theory about SIBO is the cause makes me think that he is correct, this is the only one doctor that had a clue. Now for the Treatment that I used daily : From 10 gram to 30 grams of L-Glutamine, to repair the damaged intestinal mucosa and lining. Repairing this will block big food particles from entering the blood stream directly due to the holes in the intestinal lining cause by the bad bacteria.  12 billion Probiotic daily at least, start by using the 50 billion probiotic and then after seeing results you may try to decrease to cheaper probiotics, but don´t go below 10 billion. Using the SIBO treatment first if desired: Use Xifaxan ( Rifaximin) antibiotic to wipe out the bad bacteria but this will also wipe out the good bacteria ( check for Dr. Pimentel’s SIBO treatment). While you are doing this, I advise you to take probiotics daily to compensate the bacterial slaughter in the intestines. You can also start L-Glutamine ate the same time to repair the intestinal mucosa and Lining. After the Xifaxan Treatment, keep on taking the heavy duty 50 billion probiotic daily and glutamine. After getting better, you may try to change the dosages of L-Glutamine and Probiotics and see how you adapt to lower dosages to try to save money. Since many if not all IBS people are prone to getting E.Coli overgrowth again, you will have to keep on taking L-Glutamine and Probiotics for the rest of your life. I am on this treatment for 1 year and now I eat Pizza, Junk food, Spicy food, drink sodas and Coca-Colas and am totally normal as I was before. I will not say I am cured because it must be an auto-immune disease, but you may keep it in check and be 100% normal by just taking this for the rest of you days ( L-Glutamine and Probiotics). I have tried previously all know medications for IBS, Antidepressants, anxiolytics , antispasmodics, tried acupuncture, etc. and I was only 30% better, because this medicines do not fix the problem, the just drug your gut to numbness… This treatment will take around 6 months to reach 100% improvement, but you will notice improvements after 2 months, so be patient.

ALMOST CURED!","Hello ALL! PLEASE CONTINUE READING IF YOU WANT TO STOP YOUR lichen sclerosus... So I have posted on here before, hectic flare up/ anal fissure/ uti you name it and have had lichen sclerosus for about 8-9 motnhs now. This being the worst month of my life, I got a biopsy in feb came back neg for cancer and was perscribed Celestone a steroid to put on which made it so so much worse and progressed my disease. Then I got an anal fissure from the lichen (HELL). Anyways went to a new gyno and he couldnt do a biopsy cause it was too enflamed and gave me advantan fatty cream to try and said to stop steroids. THEN I finally decided to go to a Chinese Medicine Doctor in Sydney to try my luck as I was becoming desperate and feared I would never be able to have sex again with my amazing boyfriend of 2 years (I am 24). LONG STORY SHORT he had never heard of lichen sclerosus and did the standard chinese logical medicine exam (tounge, pulse, thyroid ect) turns out, my immune system was not functioning properly and my hormones were out of wack thus causing everything else in my body to be weak and allow for viruses and chronic diseases to attack my body very easily. He said my circulation was horrible and my digestion was not ideal for the nutrients were not being distributed throughout my body (I am so healthy its rediculous so I found this quite a shock!!)  Anyways, had two 'treatments' with him and he said to STOP using anything western medicine gives me aka steroids and antibiotics. NO NO NO these are your worst enemy. Westen medicine is taught to treat what is enflamed, not the REASON why it is enflamed. He said one set of antibiotics can ruin your whole body system. So he gave me a cream that has chinese symbols all over it to apply to my lichen sclerosus, and brain/circulation herbs & toxic removal herbs at night & hormone balancing herbs to treat my immune system and get my balance back. He said if I get my blood count (white) back up and get my body balance back my lichen will simply ""dissapear"" I was hesitant of course to stop my gyno's orders and ditch the steroids for good, yes it was frightening, do I trust a little chinese man in a dingy shop who has reputable reviews of natural cures world wide? I chose YES. and for the past 9 days I have only been using the chinese herbs and the creams and limiting my gluten/sugar to help the toxins get out of my body. AND I sit here now. I have no itching, I have no pain, I can ride my bike, I went on a RUN today, I had sex again! I feel amazing and I feel mentally how I did about 3 years ago (NOT STRESSED AND ANXIETY FILLED) It is still not COMPLETELY healed but I am getting CLOSE GUYS. This is insane. My skin down there is becoming revujanated. I am never putting steroids down there again!!!!! Remember, if steroids have been helping you, they are simpoly treating the symptoms NOT the disease which I know will 100% claim is an autoimmune problem mixed with hormone imbalances and stress. So guys please try a naturopath, I know its hard. But I am getting better everyday and at this rate (I know everyone is different) but I rekon I could completely rid myself of this horrible disease FOREVER. Inbox me if you would like more details. I AM SO SO HAPPY and just want everyone with this horrible disease to have hope that YOU CAN GET RID OF IT! And of course I still use chinese medicine with the ""oversee-ing"" of a gyno but I choose to use natural NOT steroids that are going to make me have further complications later in life.  Other things to help all you ladies: MANUKA HONEY- USE IT ON YOUR FLARE UPS (I use +20 grade for extra strength) Do not use any other honey for wounds or medical purposes as it will be GRADE A and will cause further harm. EMU OIL- MOISTURIZER YES. Important to note that emu oil alone WILL NOT cure or reverse lichen sclerosus but will be an amazing natural moisturizer. COCONUT OIL- use it on your genitals. you will have a young vagina forever. Drink/ eat 2-4 tablespoons a day you will surprise yourself it is a natural viral stopper for the body. make sure it is EXTRA VIRGIN and organic. VASELINE- protector from peeing (if have flare up) and helps stop the vaguna opening from getting tighter (THIS WORKS) I apply every day now and can also be a lube! RASBERRY LEAF TEA- YOUR LIFESAVER. Drink this stuff everyday. It tones the uterus linning and is AMAZING for your digestive system, it also gets your hormone levels back to normal in about 5 days of drinking 2-3 cups a day.  There are more natural remidies which have been mentioned on this site, but in general you guys need to make sure you get heaps of sleep or your body will never recover. ALSO I only wash with emuaid Soap in the shower (bum/vag) and it is the only thing that doesn't sting for me (I have tried everything). I HOPE this helps you guys. I will chekc back in, in another week to let you know If I am actually cured, but at this rate I believe it will be. My bits down there have never looked this good, white almost gone, wounds almost completely gone!! (had sores for 4-5 months at a time) and my pink color is coming back! My swelling is completely GONE!!! My chinese doctor said I have decreased the swelling by 68% in 5 days. I am just so excited. Stay hopefull guys xxx Dsauce 32 likes, 176 replies "

Listen up people, if you want to see quicker results just use vinegar to get rid of your awful warts or veruca/s!! Get either white wine vinear or apple cider vinegar, cotton wool balls and some duck tape. Break the cotton wool into smaller pieces (slightly larger than the veruca or wart itself) Soak these cotton wool pieces in vinegar and place directly over the veruca/s. Secure in place over night with plenty of duck tape. Do this every night. In the morning, remove the tape and shower as usual. Let the area dry up during the day and leave alone. After only a few days you will feel slight tenderness in the veruca area and you will notice that it changes colour, becoming darker. I think that this is because the veruca has absorbed the vinegar and the flesh is decaying and drying up. This is the only thing that has helped me with mine. Don't waste money on over the counter products-its a waste!! Don't have them cut out or frozen or lazered-off until youhave tried this for at least 2 weeks.

Alternative and Complementary Medicine,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/how-i-cured-my-gastritis-185914,How I cured my gastritis,"When I got diagnosed with mild gastritis (but no H. Pylori) and esophagitis, I looked all over the internet to find what to do. I did not find many accounts of people who have cured themselves successfully and how they did it. So I thought I would write my story once I am cured. Here it is. If you have cured yourself from gastritis too, please share your experience below as well. Many people ask how long it takes to be cured. At first I started on dexilant for a month but I did not see any improvement. After a month I kept taking dexilant and I started the low acid diet in parallel. I got much better in 2-3 days. After two months on dexilant and one month on the diet, I felt completely good. Then I stopped the dexilant cold turkey and got a lot of pain and acidity back in my stomach. Now I regret I did not take the dexilant a little longer as my stomach was obviously not healed and not strong enough to go through the rebound effect of stopping dexilant. I regret also that I did not stop dexilant slowly taking it every other day for a week, then every three days for a week, .... I felt anxious about taking a medication that has so many side effects taken long term and I wanted to stop immediately, which was not reasonable. Anyway there I was back at the beginning with stomach pain and acidity day and night. I felt pain related to the esophagitis as well which really scared me. I hesitated to take dexilant again but I decided to try to cure myself the natural way. Below I describe what I did. I got cured in approximately two months, getting slowly better week by week. After two months of natural cures I had no stomach pain anymore and no excess acid, I was able to sleep again, felt like a new healthy (and lighter -- I lost a few pounds) person. However after those two months, I felt that I needed to follow the diet another month for my stomach to get strong and be able to handle a less strict diet. Most of what I did is summarized in two books which I found very useful: The first book is ""Dropping acid: the reflux diet cookbook & cure"" by Jamie Koufman.  This is the book I based my diet on. The only disagreements I have with the author regard dairy products that I stopped taking as they make the stomach produce more acid (very clear for me), and the use of ginger, manukka honey and aloe vera which I find too irritating and/or acidic (and I don't feel that they help). Also she does not talk about salt which is known to be irritating for the stomach lining in excess, I felt an improvement when I lowered my intake in salt. I will explain the diet more in details below.      The other book is ""Ulcer free! Nature's safe & effective remedy for ulcers"" by G. Halpern. I know you may have gastritis and no ulcers but the two conditions are related and what cures one usually cures the other too. I used some of the natural supplements recommended in this book. In particular slippery elm (this one is actually not mentioned in the book) and DGL licorice for stomach pain (coat the interior of the stomach lining), Zinc-Carnosine (reduce inflammation and protects stomach lining - I felt a great improvement after starting to take it especially with acid production at night), and cabbage juice (finished my recovery with this one, after two days I had no stomach pain anymore at night). I describe the supplements more below.     Mastic gum hurts my stomach. It is supposedly helpful against H. Pylori which I knew I did not have (I had been tested).     Prelief removes the acid in food and stomach very efficiently but causes constipation.     Tums works well for 45 minutes but then there is a rebound effect with the stomach producing more acid.     Manukka honey hurts my stomach (Too acidic, Ph level 4, but maybe also because of the tea tree essential oil in it). It is supposedly helpful against H. Pylori.     Aloe Vera is too acidic (around Ph level 4), and I don't feel it is doing anything positive.     Ginger is irritating and I don't feel it is doing anything positive.     Probiotics helps with digestion but not really for the stomach.     Zantac works very well at removing the acidity but makes me feel dizzy and incredibly tired.     PPI worked very well at removing the acidity and pain in my stomach while I was taking it while doing the diet, but I had a bad rebound effect when I stopped (one must stop slowly by taking it every other day for a while). Also having too low acid in the stomach because of PPI might cause problems in the long term (problems with Calcium and B12 absorption, bacterial infection more likely). 33 likes, 2975 replies "

Didn’t really make me feel good. I later had no follow up from my doctor and had to call in.

I'm 23 and have had trouble with diarrhea all my life. Last October I noticed blood in my stool when I wiped. I attributed it to hemorrhoids as I did have a habit of sitting on the toilet too long. Fast forward to about a month ago, I've been experiencing really bad intermittent stomach pain, bleeding, mucus in my stool, mucus that leaks into my underwear, and still putting up with the diarrhea. I sometimes have normal stools, sometimes its thin, sometimes its diarrhea, but as I mentioned I've had sporadic bowel movements my whole life. I am a bit of a worrier, so any little thing sets me off, but I have noticed that over the last week or so I've been constantly burping and feeling nauseous when I eat. I'm terrified this is a sign that the cancer has gotten so advanced its causing an obstruction. Could this really be anything other than colon cancer? I have a colonoscopy and upper endoscopy scheduled for next Wednesday, but part of me thinks ""what's the point. If I've waited months since my first symptoms I'm as good as gone anyway"" I know that's a horrible way of thinking, but as I said I'm a bit of a worrier. I suffer from severe anxiety.

Bowel Cancer,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/suspect-blood-in-stool--673408,suspect blood in stool.,"Hi, I am a 17 year old male who has just encountered a problem that has me seriously worried. While I have found red blotches in my stool 2 or 3 times in the last several months, it has occurred twice today, although I think I have found what's wrong. When it happened before, it always happened after eating something red, like pizza with tomatoes for example. So about thirty minutes ago - it's about to get pretty nasty so be warned - I went hands on with two pairs of gloves and the red solid I found appeared jelly like, and I remembered I ate red peppers and salsa with my dinner last night, which has somewhat calmed me down. After googling other symptoms of bowel cancer, I do not have any others apart from possible blood, as I have put on four pounds in the last month, very rarely suffer from fatigue, never get diarrhoea and rarely suffer cramps/wind. The fact it appeared like an undigested pepper and I am only 17 - I read it is very rare for young people to suffer from this disease, especially my age - do you think I can rest easy and attribute it to the food? Any reply would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.  0 likes, 3 replies "

Bowel Cancer,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/concerned-symptoms-676461,Concerned/Symptoms,"Apologies for long post in advance.   49 yo male, for the record.  For the past 2 months, I have been in a frenzy.  A little over a year ago, I was diagnosed with GERD, based on upper right and left quadrant pain.  A month later, I was freaking out over this, plus stool color change.  Went to gastro, did abdominal ultrasound, blood work and a stool test.  All came back clear.  In June of this year, had upper quadrant pain again, but when I went to bathroom, for a few days, not much coming out.  Freaked out, I first went to Urgent Care.  Got told GERD again.  Not satisfied, went to gastro next day.  He said same, didn't seem concerned.  However, I remained in panic mode since.  Stools have been all over the place- some well formed, some soft.  Sometimes high volume, sometimes just a bit(should be noted that I have always had stomach issues since childhood but never diagnosed with anything). And frequency for me is 2-3 times daily. Now, ever since that June appt, I have lost 10 lbs.  To be fair, my diet was all over- tons of fruits and veggies(had days where it was hard to eat, but ate), and at times was able to just eat anything.  Lost 8 lbs in first month, when the panic was super high, and maybe the other two when it may have lessened?  Or when I started eating differently? Anyway, gastro doc did more blood and stool work.   Again, all came back fine.  I was so obsessed over stool, I took pics of every movement for 2 months.  He looked at pics, was unimpressed- thought nothing about size, color, shape.   A few even had mucus.  He didn't seem worried.  Asked him if he was worried about the weight loss, he said ""no, but watch it.""  GP said he wasn't concerned.  Thinks anxiety, because it began since the first gastro dr appt in June.  Referred me to a psychiatrist.   Have colonoscopy scheduled for October.  But I am really afraid something is wrong, and panicking because I feel like my drs dont. I don't feel sick at all- never had a fever.  Never nauseous, no vomiting.  Fstigue?  I can't say, because I am able to do everything I need/want to with no issues.  As in, I don't feel overly tired, to my understanding.  Occasional night sweats.  No problems sleeping, however.   And no issues eating for the past few weeks at all. A doctor friend believes this is all ibs, but I am not sure.  She says my anxiety over it all- and symptom checkkng online, along with taking stool pics is making everything worse.  My wife feels the same, and I think that's what my GP believes, too.   Any thoughts from fellow forum members?  I am driving all around me crazy, as well as myself, and it's not fair to them.  Is a psychiatrist the right move, too?   Thank you in advance, and again- apologies. 0 likes, 3 replies "

I've had chronic constipation for several years now. I'm hardly ever not constipated. I haven't really thought about it much or been that concerned about it (I had assumed it might've been from my eating habits which probably aren't the best and I need to fix), but a couple of years ago my grandmother on my dad's side died of colon cancer, and now I'm kind of concerned about it. Yesterday I had a stool that was oddly narrow- Not super super thin but not full-sized either, and that's gotten me really freaked out. I also have some uncomfortableness in my abdominal region sometimes that I had chalked up to the constipation. I've never had any blood in my stools, haven't lost a ton of weight as far as I know and haven't lost my appetite though sometimes I do get full kind of quickly sometimes. Should I be concerned? Is there any reason to think I might have colon cancer? Or am I just working myself up over nothing? I could really use some advice. 0 likes, 16 replies "
Bowel Cancer,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/need-to-work-this-out-672276,Need to work this out ,"Hi all! Hopefully some of you can help me figure out what's going on. I'm 29 year old female with family history of breast cancer. Over Thanksgiving weekend of 2017 I experienced extreme lower abdominal pain and cramping along with a mild fever. The pain got so extreme that I needed to hold the bottom of my stomach as I walked. After about 4 days the pain calmed and I only experienced minor pain for about a week after. Even though pain was deminishing I did go to urgent care just to be safe. The doctor asked some general questions and pushed on my left side which did cause sensitivity. He told me that he thought it was ibs and sent me on my way. Following that visit I had fluctuating symptoms of constipation, diarrhea after eating higher fat foods and nausea in the morning. These lasted for about 2 months and then seemed to go away. With only occasional flutters twinges here and there.  In April, I spiked another fever this time getting up to 103  F (but quickly dropped back down by the following morning) , and same abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhea which lasted for about a week before going away. Lucky me though, I got exposed to hand, foot and mouth and while in the incubation period got another high fever. Again breaking 103  but quickly dropping back down. Back into urgent care I went, this time to get the hand, foot and mouth diagnosis. They took some blood and said that I had a high wbc and thought I had an infection but not hand, foot and mouth since I didn't display any rash. They hooked my up to an IV, gave a bunch of medication and sent me on my way. That night I broke out in hives and psoriasis looking rashes all over my body. Went back into urgent care and they told me they thought it was a reaction to the medication they had giving through the IV. Sent me back home and told me to take benadryl. Three days later I had a swollen lymph nodes and another visit to the urgent care. Again they told me not to worry and that it was common. And suggested that I make an appointment with my primary. 1 month (June, 2018 at this point) later I am in to see my primary and he tells me that the test from the urgent care showed me to have iron deficiency anemia. He send me out for more test and my blood work comes back with anemia, high wbc, high platelets and high c-reactive. Theysend me to a hematologist who tells me that I'm only slightly anemic and it's most likely caused by heavy periods. I inform him that I have irregular periods that do last a while but I haven't had one since these symptoms started. He tells me that it could be something to do with my intestine but only refers me out to get an ultrasound of my ovaries. The following weekend I start to experience pain again this time including extreme bloating and pressure. I go back in for another visit with the urgent care and they tell me wbc is high still but they wouldn't consider me anemic any longer. I ask them if these new symptoms are more psychological since I'm being bounced around with no real answers and they say it could be but to continue with the follow ups as you never know.  1 week later I'm still experiencing symptoms and now it feels like a balloon has been bloat up on my lower left side. Next day I'm back at urgent care this time freaking out because I'm worried that something is serious. The tenderness on my. Left side is back. I'm pooping normally during all of this but they send me out for an ultrasound of my ovaries and my stomach and xrays of my stomach. Ultrasounds come back good, and xray only shows some minor constipation. They give me some medicine for it and send me on my way.  Since I consider myself to be normal on my bowel movements previously they suggested I finish the bottle over the next week and go from there. However, by this point I'm so stressed out that I start pushing heavily while using the restroom. About four days into the medication and I'm having a feeling of pressure in my butt and feeling like I'm never finished. This last for another week but then seemed to clear up when I make some dietary changes. (This is probably July 10th, 2018 by this point.)  All my stomach issues seem to go away for about two weeks time by eating more greens and, however one day I get constipated again and the incomplete feeling returns. This has now been going for around a week and during that time. I've had both constipation and diarrhea along with general pain in my stomach still on the left side but sometimes across the bottom and on the right.  My question is this, should I be concerned. My initial assumption would be that this is ibs, since my stomach symptoms switch between the too and while I'll occasionally have an ache or a pain in my stomach majority of the pain has been resolved by using the restroom. That being said, I know ibs doesn't cause elevated wbc, anemia or high c-reactive. And that those type of workups usually accompany something more serious. I feel like the rash that I've been experiencing with the more extreme periods of symptoms could possibly connect to an ibd like ulceritis colitis but I'm also concerned about the possibility of colon cancer since constipation doesn't usually follow typical ibd symptoms. I do finally have a referral out for a coloniscpy but it has yet to be scheduled. My GI says that it could be ibs but he wants to rule everything out. Which honestly just kinda freaks me out more.  My family history does include breast cancer but not colon cancer, and I'm at a pretty young age which makes me find it unlikely. However, I worry that the overall delays that I've been experiencing with any type of really diagnose could be putting me at some serious risk. I feel like I'm so in my head right now that I can't trust my memories or my bodies. I don't feel like over the ladt 8 months that I've been experiencing any constant abdominal pain, and as stated about for the most part outside of an occasional ache most discomfort is resolved by using the restroom.  0 likes, 15 replies "

The doctor just said to keep on a bland diet in which I did and It took two weeks to get better. It was only until recently I started eating kind of unhealthy for the weekend and then I had listerine at night which triggered painful stomach cramps and then started my acid reflux again. The first time I went to the doctor I was 157lb which was 3 weeks ago, as of my follow up appointment which was 4 days ago I weighed 153lb, yesterday was 151.4, today is Sunday which I check my weight every morning is now 150.4. Does this sound like massive weight loss? I also feel bloated all the time and can't seem to sleep because my stomach is constantly pulsing which sounds odd. My stools were normal when I first started the bland diet but after that listerine incident they are back to loose mushy stools. I'm thinking about going to the emergency room or something but I don't think they would run any tests to clear out cancer, thoughts? I also eat like broccoli, rice, little bit of chicken for dinner or with cabbage. For morning and lunch I would have a turkey spinach sandwich or a probiotic yogurt and banana.

It started when I found swollen lymph nodes in my body back in my freshman year of high school. Also, I had a lot of bowel problems but this has been the case my whole life and suggests something else (IBS.) I went to Dr. Google and googled my symptoms and, of course, it came up with all types of cancers. As a kid, this scared me to death. I went to my family doctor 4 or 5 times, got 2   which came back normal, and lost sleep. I was convinced I had some sort of cancer. I would think about it so much that the   would literally make me sick and create physical symptoms (body aches,  , armpit pain, etc.) I eventually realized my worries were utterly stupid, as my symptoms would be worse when I would constantly think about it. So I stopped worrying about it. I also made some lifestyle changes because I ate unhealthy. As a result, I felt better and stopped worrying about it throughout high school. Now I am a freshman in college and I am starting to have bowel issues and gas issues and body aches. Of course, I looked these up and I have now convinced myself I have colon cancer. This can be seen as even more ridiculous, because colon cancer is extremely rare in 18 year olds (even though I have family history of it.) Now, I would not be shocked if I had something like IBS or acid reflux. However, those are not fatal illnesses and can be managed through better lifestyle choices. The problem is I cant seem to let go of the possibility that I do have cancer, even though I most likely do not. I know people on medical forums have little to no patience for hypochondriacs, but I am here to finally accept that I have a mental problem which is causing me to have exaggerated physical symptoms. I want this nightmare to end and just be a normal college kid. I hate living with the idea that I have some life ending illness, even though I do not give any indication that I am terribly sick. In fact, I have a lot more energy than most of my friends.

Just over 6 months ago I started having bad abdominal pains followed by watery diarrhea. Over the next day or so this turned bloody and I went to ER, where they gave me   and told me it was probably bacterial  . My inflammation markers were high and my iron levels were low (I wasn't anemic, just low in iron). The antibiotics seemed to clear things up, and any blood that was visible went away after 5 days or so, along with the stomach cramping.   afterwards showed my inflammation markers were normal, along with normal thyroid levels but still lowered iron (concerned about this because I know this is a symptom of bowel cancer). A month or so later I had a very itchy rectum and what seemed to be the early signs of an anal  , again I was prescribed antibiotics and it left. Fast forward to now (6 months later) I don't have any visible blood, but on a couple of occasions I have noticed foul smelling mucus in an otherwise normal looking stool. I have regular patterns of how often and when I have a bowel movement. Sometimes my stools seem pretty loose but I wouldn't call it diarrhea., but generally my stools tend to vary over the course of weeks. I visited a gastroenterologist to follow up the anal   and the scary symptoms which lasted 5 days, and he said I'm far too young for it to be colorectal cancerand didn't even suggest it as an idea. He said if anything its a 50/50 it might be crohns disease or a really bad infection that didn't get picked up in any stool samples.

I had a colonoscopy done in June due to symptoms I have - diarrhoea, bleeding from rectum, cramps, nausea, low grade fever, swollen glands, sore back and stiff and sore joints. Outside the digestive symptoms I feel completely ignored. The focus has been on those. Anyway, I had the colonoscopy done, I had to chase my results as they were lost. Eventually heard back and was told non specific inflammation. I finally had my follow up appointment today and was told all was normal and they can't do anything for me. I have an appointment January 18th with gastroenterology. I am just so frustrated with the whole thing. I've had symptoms for a few years but since the start of this year they've gotten a lot worse. Blood tests come back as CRP slightly raised, kidneys good, the rest satisfactory. These are the same results the past 3 times in the past 6 months. I've had calprotectin done twice (clear both times) and the FOB board done with the 3 samples. Clear as well. I am not lactose intolerant or gluten intolerant. No parasites. All those have been checked. I'm annoyed that after them losing my results I'm still no further forward.  I'm exhausted. I work 20 hours in a physical job and I do nothing but it and sleep.

Too many strange symptoms cropping up such as yellow gold colored stool, bloating every time stomach empties. Laying down helps as does Aciphex, tums. It acts like acid but I think bile. When I wake up in morning I can literally feel the dreaded bubbles of gas start to fill my stomach. If I eat every 2 hours exactly that controls it to some extent during the day but when my Aciphex stops after 12 hours I am in agony again. By bedtime I have to lay down so early just to slow the bloating down otherwise I have to take Tums until I do go to bed. I have always had IBS with multiple food and med intolerances but this is definitely not this. I know bloat comes with IBS but I never had this with my IBS before (over 50 years).

Just wondered if anyone has experienced anything similar? With regards to the feeling in the ribs at no point has it been massively painful to the point where I have needed to take any pain killers or anything like that. It just feels more uncomfortable than anything else rather than painful as if there is something under my ribs that should be there. The lower left ribs feel bruised to touch but again not that painful. I play football and go to the gym and have been able to continue both without any trouble or issues. With regards to my bowels they have just been a bit all over the place since it started really. At first I kind of felt constipated and was having bowel movements but size and quantity wise there wasn't as much coming out as normal or as expected and had a feeling of not fully emptying. In the last month that has changed slightly in that I have had a couple of what I would call regular sized and quantity movements but they seem to happen every 3 or 4 days and in between the movements are the fairly small quantities mentioned and usually very irregular shapes and sizes although the feeling of not emptying seems to have gone or reduced. I have been to see my GP 3 or four times since this started. First couple of times they had a feel around and couldn't feel anything untoward and suggested it was just a bit of   so suggest some over the counter laxitives and then when that didnt work prescribed some Laxido sachets which again didnt do anything really. I have now had a blood test and an chest xray that I am awaiting the results of and have an ultrasound booked in but that isn't for another 3 weeks. In the meantime I just really suffering a bit mentally not knowing what this is and obviously worrying this could be something serious. Just keep searching and searching online and must have diagnosed myself with about 25 different things which I know is silly but can't help it. I am someone that never usually gets ill so this is very out of the ordinary for me. I am only 32 and lead a pretty active lifestyle, eat well, don't smoke and don't drink too much, weight and BMI is all in the decent range - all things which my GP keeps telling me means that it being something serious is unlikely but at the same time it doesn't show any sign of easing up. Not had any diarrhea at all in the 3 months although stools have been pretty soft the whole time even when not much is coming out. Not had any blood in my stools that I have been able to notice. Its just so frustrating as for 3 months whilst I have been able to go to work etc I just feel like I am constantly at about 70%. I feel ok physically but not great and mentally I just feel shot to pieces. Obviously I need to wait for my results and take from there but just seems such a drawn out affair to try and convince GP that something just doesn't feel right and just wondered if anyone had suffered anything similar to this? 6 likes, 316 replies "

I know doctors know better than you guys but still have a few questions. can being ""unwell"" really cause ulcers in the bowel? the doctor I last seen said the symptoms do match up with chrons disease because I get stomach cramps, diarrhea, toilet multiple times a day and recently diagnosed with b12 deficiency.

My doctor however tells me he has never heard of this phenomenon and has no idea what is causing it.  Be that as it may I am not imagining it. It is compounded by a strong taste of salt which I never ever use on food or cooking. The last infection raised the question of colonisation in the tube.  I wonder whether anyone else has had the same experience particularly with salt taste. I drink routinely a great deal of water. 0 likes, 11 replies "

As far as I knew I didn't have any side effects. But I seemed to be going from one course of prednisolone to the next because of breathing difficulties. I kept seeing the GP who wasn't much help and finally put me on a graduated dose of  ...coming down 1mg every 3 days. That would have meant I wouldn't finish this course until almost the end of February. I wasn't prepared to do that!! I started wondering if the Septrin was causing me 'breathlessness'? I checked the side affects...yes was possible so I rang my pharmacist (Saturday afternoon) and she suggested I stopped it for 48hrs and also monitored my peak flow...it was a poorly 150 at that time. Almost immediately I noticed the difference and my peak flow increased to 200. I also had another 'light bulb' moment. My asthma has always been allergy related so I started taking a daily antihistamine again.  (I'd stopped taking them back in 2016 when a nutritionist wanted a blood test, I didn't restart them and shortly afterwards was diagnosed with BX.) I can't tell you all how different my breathing is now....peak flow 250, 8 days off Septrin and 5 days with an antihistamine.  I altered the dose of the prednisolone to down 5mg every 3 days so am due to finish those on Tuesday. I know my consultant won't have a problem with any of this self discovery and altering the meds around. The GP would be an entirely different matter...LOL. 4 likes, 12 replies "

I was diagnosed with bronchiectasis in June and then in September I got what is called a pulmonary cement embolism. (very rare, in told) Yes, it is an embolism in the pulmonary artery in my lungs that is made of cement that they used to fix my fractured vertebrae. This happened following a procedure I had. I started having problems breathing and ended up in the ICU for a couple of days. At this point I was sent home on blood thinners and oxygen. after 7 weeks I was told I could stop both and since my oxygen was doing well I was happy to quit it. in the last week or so I have been really struggling to breathe. Sometimes my oxygen will show normal and sometimes it will be around 83-86. this typically happens when I get up to do something like go to the bathroom or walk to the kitchen for a drink of water. I am back to wearing my oxygen 24/7 and yesterday I saw my pulmonologist again and he put me on 30 mg of prednisone and i had an X ray of my chest done and some blood tests done and a couple of pulmonary test done. the blood work all turned out fine. And he ran like a CBC and anemia panel and inflammation panel. the chest x-ray  was where I'm a little confused. he said that my lungs were not fully inflating with air so his suggestion was for me to breathe deeply. he is a very conservative doctor and as much as I appreciate that I find that that treatment is a bit, well ridiculous. It's not like I'm not breathing. I am making an effort to breathe deeply since they told me to start doing that. but of course every time I get up the symptoms return.

Breast Cancer and Screening,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/breast-cancer-awareness-feature-w3ibrahim-697638,Breast Cancer Awareness Feature | w3ibrahim,"Breast cancer awareness is an effort to raise awareness and reduce the stigma of breast cancer through education on symptoms and treatment. Supporters hope that greater knowledge will lead to earlier detection of breast cancer, which is associated with higher long-term survival rates, and that money raised for breast cancer will produce a reliable, permanent cure. Breast cancer advocacy and awareness efforts are a type of health advocacy. Breast cancer advocates raise funds and lobby for better care, more knowledge, and more patient empowerment. They may conduct educational campaigns or provide free or low-cost services. Breast cancer culture, sometimes called pink ribbon culture, is the cultural outgrowth of breast cancer advocacy, the social movement that supports it, and the larger women's health movement. The pink ribbon is the most prominent symbol of breast cancer awareness, and in many countries the month of October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Some national breast cancer organizations receive substantial financial support from corporate sponsorships (King 2006, p. 2). Marketing approaches The goal of breast cancer awareness campaigns is to raise the public's ""brand awareness"" for breast cancer, its detection, its treatment, and the need for a reliable, permanent cure. Increased awareness has increased the number of women receiving mammograms, the number of breast cancers detected, and the number of women receiving biopsies (Sulik 2010, pp. 157–210). Overall, as a result of awareness, breast cancers are being detected at an earlier, more treatable stage. Awareness efforts have successfully utilized marketing approaches to reduce the stigma associated with the disease. Generally speaking, breast cancer awareness campaigns have been highly effective in getting attention for the disease. Breast cancer receives significantly more media coverage than other prevalent cancers, such as prostate cancer (Arnst 2007). Breast cancer as a brand A pink ribbon, an international symbol of breast cancer awareness. Breast cancer advocacy uses the pink ribbon and the color pink as a concept brand to raise money and increase screening. The breast cancer brand is strong: people who support the ""pink brand"" are members of the socially aware niche market, who are in favor of improved lives for women, believe in positive thinking, trust biomedical science to be able to solve any problem if given enough money, and prefer curative treatments to prevention (Sulik 2010, p. 22; King 2006, p. 38). The brand ties together fear of cancer, hope for early identification and successful treatment, and the moral goodness of women with breast cancer and anyone who visibly identifies themselves with breast cancer patients. This brand permits and even encourages people to substitute conscientious consumption and individual symbolic actions, like buying or wearing a pink ribbon, for concrete, practical results, such as collective political action aimed at discovering non-genetic causes of breast cancer (Sulik 2010, pp. 133–146). The establishment of the brand and the entrenchment of the breast cancer movement has been uniquely successful, because no countermovement opposes the breast cancer movement or believes that breast cancer is desirable (King 2006, p. 111). Pink ribbon Main article: Pink ribbon A pink ribbon is a symbol of breast cancer awareness. It may be worn to honor those who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, or to identify products that a manufacturer would like to sell to consumers that are interested in breast cancer. Pink ribbons are sometimes sold as fundraisers, much like poppies on Remembrance Day. The pink ribbon is associated with individual generosity, faith in scientific progress, and an optimistic ""can-do"" attitude. It encourages individuals to focus on the emotionally appealing ultimate vision of a cure for breast cancer, rather than the reality that there is no certain cure for breast cancer, and no guarantee there will ever be such a cure (Sulik 2010, pp. 359–361). The practice of blindly wearing or displaying a pink ribbon without making other, more concrete efforts to cure breast cancer has been described as a kind of slacktivism due to its lack of real effects (Landman 2008), and has been compared to equally simple yet ineffective ""awareness"" practices like the drive for women to post the colors of their bras on Facebook (Borrelli 2010) Critics say that the feel-good nature of pink ribbons and ""pink consumption"" distracts society from the lack of progress in curing breast cancer (Sulik 2010, pp. 365–366) It is also criticized for reinforcing gender stereotypes and objectifying women and their breasts (Sulik 2010, pp. 372–374) 0 likes, 0 replies "

I'm so anxious and right now i'm trying my best to write with tons of tears in my eyes. I'm scared, too scared. It all started 2 months ago when I was in my third round of clomid. This time they gave me 100mg and also to take 4 mg of folic acid per day (the other 2 times i took 50mg of clomid and no folic acid). After taking the pills, while I was going to ultrasounds to see if I ovulated I notice that my left armpit was a little swollen ( I am right handed) but didn't feel pain just a little discomfort that sometimes went to my arm and neck but nothing that will make me stop sleeping or doing things. I asked my fertility doctor and said that it was not because of the pills. Went to the gynechologist and she couldn't feel any lump anywhere. Went to my GP and told me to go to a breast and cancer specialist. In the meantime the waiting was so long that my GP said to go to the ER so they can make an ultrasound. I did but... they did an ultrasound for my veins and not on my swollen armpit. Ridiculuos. Even though I complaint they didn't listen. My armpit looks a little bit less swollen, only a tiny bit. Today finally got the appointment and she touched my armpit over and over again. She was making me put my arms up and down. She was concentrating so hard closing her eyes but she couldn't understand what it was. She felt a little lump on my breast next to that armpit but she said it felt like a cyst. She saw my ultrasounds from the ER but she automatically said ""you'll have to do a mammography even though you are young (i'm 29. no history of cancer in family) and then an ultrasound"" That freaked me out and makde me thing that maybe she saw something in those other ultrasounds? idk. She then said ""i'll see you in 3 months and if by then you still have it or feel discomfort then we will send you for an MRI""...... idk what to think....  I don't want to be sick. I want to be a healthy almost 30 yo woman and be able to have a family as my plan was to proceed to IVF on January. I'm so scared. It's been 2 months since this all started and none of those days i've been able to have a calm day because i'm scared. I can't understand how much wait for an answer......  1 like, 14 replies "

Hopefully someone is still on here. I see that the group hasn’t been active for five months.

Another odd feeling I get a few times a day is the feeling that my nipples are leaking or wet, but when I check the bra, theres nothing there. I've even tried squeezing the nipples and nothing happens. I do notice the nipple is erect and cold, so maybe thats causing the odd feeling.  Im 44 and had a partial   two years ago.

Bipolar Affective Disorder,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-think-my-boyfriend-has-bipolar-661386,I think my boyfriend has bipolar,"I’ve been together with my boyfriend for about 10 months. Most of the time we have been together, it has been amazing - we are happy, and in love, and inseparable. But there are times where this happy, bubbly person disappears, and is replaced with the shell of a person, who can barely get out of bed and go to work.  After seeing him fall into this depression on more than one occasion, I encouraged him to seek help, which he eventually did. He has now been on anti-depressants for a few months, which I thought were helping in modulating his moods, but he has recently fallen back into this depression.  I am trying desperately hard to support him, but when he is in these moods he is impossible to reason with and completely illogical. I try to support him and even just be near him, but he says it’s “better for me” if I stay away. He pushes me away and doesn’t let me see him (which, after spending almost every waking second together otherwise, is quite a big change). We don’t live together but usually spend every night, but then go to seeing each other almost never. He blocks me on social media because he wants to escape, and doesn’t want to think about things, and then accuses me of not caring about him. Things are worse when he drinks. But then once he’s out of the slump, it’s like nothing ever happened, and he’s so apologetic and lovely and kind.  This is really affecting me mentally. I find it impossible to keep up with his moods, and am exhausted trying to have a conversation with him. When we talk, it goes around in circles about how he doesn’t want his mood to affect me so he pushes me away to “protect” me and, which hurts me more, and him, by not allowing me to be there.  I am lost and I don’t know how to break out of this viscious cycle. I love him so much and all I want is to help him, but I don’t know how to broach the pattern in his behaviour without him becoming defensive or verbally attacking me - especially when he won’t let me see him.  Please let me know of any advice.  0 likes, 6 replies "

I’m 20 she’s 19, She told me from the get that she had these type of issues, being bipolar being one of them, and I’m like a really chill person and everyone I know has always made it seem like I’m very helpful when it comes to emotions and such so I felt like I could handle it. We were good, great most of the time for a good 4-6 months. Then the types of arguments we started to have became a lot for me to process. I myself am not diagnosed with anything but I’ve been one and out of therapy and  psychiatrists and they all tell me about the same that i most likely have severe anxiety and depression (this I clearly already knew because lord know I might as well be in 07 with MCR) so already from there you can assume where my mind set seems to go once i have upset her. She gets upset about majority of things I say or might do. She doesn’t like my friends she feels they are all terrible people because when we were all like 15-17 there were stupid petty teenage issues and drama so thing were said and feeling where ofc hurt. So now that me and her are together she feels I don’t be respect her feelings by being friends with them. She always wants me to herself if I ask her for space she gets upset and tells me how I don’t want her around and I’ve tried telling her it so not her I just need time to myself sometimes specially when I’m going through extreme emotions, I have severely bad communication issue to the point I physically can’t speak and feel like s**t and i cant get out of it so any time after she starts upset I get like this. She wasn’t always like this it’s only when she’s upset and it got bad to the point she’s spit on me, slapped me, punched me in the face, hit my head on a wall, because I’ll refuse to speak when ever we argue because I don’t know what to say and when I true to apologize she gets more upset and says I don’t because my actions say other wise and how I do it to myself and that I could avoid it ignore I listen to her more and I honestly and at a point where idk anymore. People are telling me leave her people are telling me if I love love her trying because if you love someone you work on things instead of leaving. There’s so many like issues to get at I haven’t been even gotten into all of it yet. I’m not the best person ive sat and watched her cry and every time i do somethingg wrong to her I just want to let a leave her alone like i feel terrible like I shouldn’t be around around her every time time ive tries to break up with her she bugs out and tries to kill herself or just get overly depressed and Crys all the time and I’ll feel bad and go back because I love her and I hate seeing her seeing her I just feel like I’m the problem. She tells me I don’t dont consider feelings how I only a apologize to get her to Shutterstock up and that the tone of voice I use when we argue doesn’t be help and how I don’t dont love her and how I’ve i wasnt like this before and I just feel so drained I guess all the time like nothing I i do is right. Our sex life also started dying out because we’ll we are lesbians. Or at least I am she’s bisexual but im the first real female relationship she’s ever had and I myself have only ever been with one other person in my life which was also a female mean while she had multiple bfs before me. So I only really know but so much. The thing is. I’m a switch and shes 100 percent sub, she told me this in the beginning and at the time I liter hadn’t had sex in over a year I didn’t fr feel it was something i needed. Then I gotta with her and we were f*****g all the time burn it was just me f*****g her and my feelings about it began to change because obviously I’m attracted to my gf and want her to want me. I’ve tried to bring this up but it bothers her and she says she’s not like that and doesn’t know wh what to tell because she’s told me from the get and I understand but idk me confused like what person doesn’t want to like touch the person they are with unless they don’t like like sex she’s fully does if anything she’s a sex addict. I feel like I can’t take ralk  her about anything because when I do I try just upsets her and then when I distance myself and say things like nvm she’s gets more upset. I want this to work but it’s like how, she says all I have to do is love her and tell her I love her burn  can’t communicate the way she want or needs and I hate I it and she won’t let me leave  either.

Epilepsy and Non-epileptic seizures,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/increasing-seizures--673482,Increasing seizures?,"Back in 2014, I was diagnosed with PNES (pseudo seizures). I also have PTSD, Bipolar 1 with severe pyschosis (or schizoaffective disorder. I've had multiple doctors flop between the two or chalk everything up to PTSD), BPD, GAD with panic attacks. I still can't figure out what to do. I'm severely allergic to medications like Topamax, Lamictal, Tripletal, Depakote (sp?), Tegrotral (sp?). All of which I've tried and ended up with DRESS Syndrome. Whenever I get sudden bouts of panic/terror or a doom-and-gloom feeling, I stop recognizing where I am and my body. I don't believe this is related to PTSD because there isn't a trigger. It's more common before going to sleep and waking up. I hallucinate (mostly visual), tremble or shake but not violently, and always get a buzzing feeling throughout my body. Rarely, I lose consciousness. The few times I have, I was out for 10 minutes. Recently, I've had an increase in déj  vu, pounding in my stomach, and always feeling like I'm going to pass out. The longest it has lasted has been a week, resulting in an episode last night before bed. Usually, the episodes happen back to back (like 2 or 3 in a small time span) and then I'm okay. Aching and worn out, but okay. I understand that my stress and trying to cope with trauma can set it off. But what I don't understand is the manic that follows. I'm really confused as to what's what and how to treat it. It's interfering with my daily life. I do attend therapy regularly and am not medicated. I haven't seen a neurologist since my diagnosis because I'm tired of them just brushing it off or throwing medication at me, knowing I have   to medicines in the same group.

I’m wondering what your symptoms and signs of endometriosis were before and/or after diagnosis and what medications, treatments, and procedures you tried. I’d like to hear your story to offer hope and wisdom for all the women who suffer from this debilitating disease. I’ve had endo gor 6 years, I also am missing my right Fallopian tube after an ectopic pregnancy ruptured in 2012. After my surgery I had 2 more miscarriages but still have yet to conceive. I was diagnosed with endometriosis laparoscopically in 2013, had 13 spots removed from my abdomen, pelvis and ovaries and other areas, then went on a high estrogen pill. After treatment I felt pretty good! I had very mild periods for years and stayed relatively healthy, exercising with a balanced diet. I stopped taking the pill in late 2016 to try to conceive but sadly to no avail. Since then my partner and I broke up but I never went back on the pill mainly because of the depression symptoms. And now, at 28 years old I am seriously regretting stopping the pill because my symptoms have returned with a vengeance. I’ve been in agony the past 5 months with an array of symptoms like: lower right back pain (somewhat flank area) tenderness in ribs, swollen lymph nodes in neck, armpit, and groin, moderate pelvic pain. My right hip/buttock area has severe shooting pain that travels down my leg. The right side of my neck throbs in pain making it hard to turn my neck or keep it turned for any extended period of time, my right ear feels full, then the pain travels down to the right side of my chest and into my breast, even down my arm. There is a pulling sensation in my neck and back at times, like my muscles and bones are being stretched tightly at opposite directions. I have no appetite, which really sucks because I’m also Type One Diabetic and slightly underweight (115 lbs, 5’7). I also have allergic asthma, keep getting headaches, constant mood swings with a lot of crying and just feeling hopeless and melancholy. Sometimes it’s hard to walk properly, I limp because it hurts to apply weight to my leg. I get extreme gas and belly pain, loud bowel sounds and excess burping, mild heartburn, nausea, slight dizziness and malaise, extreme fatigue (sleeping 11-12 hours). My lack of energy is keeping me from doing all the things I really want to do😪 I’m on an array of prescription medications for type 1 diabetes (Novalog Insulin), (Gabapentin) for seizure, muscle relaxers (Baclofen), anti-inflammatorys (Volteren) I also sometimes use ibuprofen and Tylenol. I take Singulair for asthma, lisinopril for kidneys, Trazadone for sleep/depression, and a vitamin supplement called “ ”.

I am looking for some guidance/suggestions before I speak with my gyn again. My periods before birth control were insanely heavy (1 pad every 1-2 hours) and 8 days long with bad cramps. In 2016 I began experiencing intermittent pelvic pain, never in the same spot. I also had extreme pain with sex. I was on norethindrone at this time, which I now know is a treatment for endometriosis, hence some confusion now. I came off all birth control and it didn't stop. My birth control was then  switched to Junel Fe which stopped the majority of the pain but caused a blood clot so I stopped it. Because of the blood clot, my only option was an IUD. I got the Kyleena IUD in January 2017. My period was so abnormal I did not get a regular period until June 2018. Up until this point I would have random spotting with the occasional period at random times. Spotting more days than not. No pain, however. I finally got a regular period for 4 months and then I got a period that lasted almost 30 days, only stopped by starting medroxyprogesterone 2.5mg daily. I have been on it for probably 1.5 months but now I have my period again. It is fairly light, average I'd say, with cramps though. Day 5 right now. I was under the impression I would not get a period on this pill (called my gyn no answer yet). I know this pill can also treat endo. I hate this constant struggle and would love if I could get a doctor to give me a reason and a plan for once. Has anyone experienced this or have any clue? FYI- I have had multiple ultrasounds & tests; no cysts, fibroids, PID, STD/STI's, etc. No clearly visible problems. 0 likes, 2 replies "

The pain I'm experiencing is definitely different than period pain, and sometimes gets worse with periods, but not always - it's always on the same side too, and hasn't really traveled anywhere else, which is what makes me think it isn't endo, but I just don't know what else it could be. I really don't think it's just cysts since two of the ultrasounds didn't find them when I had pain, but I don't know what other roads I should be going down.  Just looking for people's different experiences and how they first started to know they might have endo Thanks 0 likes, 6 replies "

I had random spotting with mirena for the first year, with random sharp cramps. A year later I started ovulating and bleeding again, the cramps were so bad, it would radiate to my cervix and vagina. An ultrasound showed the mirena in it's correct position my gyn put me on a low dose of LENEST 20ED alongside the mirena. I have to say this thankfully stopped the bleeding and pain, however, the pain has returned. I'm quite worried about this pain and wondering if it's the mirena IUD that is causing my pain. This pain can last all day and feels like someone is squeezing my insides. My lower abdomen even forms a dip while it does this. Sometimes it is triggered after a bowel movement. I would like to know if this has happened to anyone else? If so, do you recommend removing the mirena and continue to take the pill back to back? I'm becoming so paranoid and anxious, I am worried about the next episode of pain happening. I would like to remove it for my piece of mind. Thanks 😃 0 likes, 3 replies "

I haven’t been diagnosed with endo but I’m seeing a specialist next week to discuss have an exploratory lap. I know someone who had all my symptoms and ended up with stage 4 endo so that’s why im going this route. I wanted to know if anyone’s main symptom has been nausea? I’ve been on a birth control pill (BCP) since I started my period at 15 (I’m now 28). I went on it because my periods were heavy, painful and two weeks long. I lived a normal life after starting a BCP. Once married I got pregnant 2 weeks after being off the BCP. After having our son and I got my period back while breastfeeding, I started having painful periods, those turned into extremely nauseating and somewhat painful periods. I decided to try the pill, it didn’t help. Tried Mirena and my body couldn’t handle it. SO MUCH PAIN. So we took that out. After the Mirena the periods got more nauseating. Now I’m nauseated every single day. I’ve had to quit my job, my family helps take care of our two year old and I am pretty much bed ridden with debilitating nausea which worsens during my ovulation times and periods. Ice had EVERY GI test/exam done. Even went to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota because nobody could figure me out. Have had brain scans and everything. I’ve seen three obgyns and they say I have “mommy tummy” WTF?! Anyways, has anyone had nausea as a main symptom? I have cramps and ovarian pain all throughout the month at random times but it’s the nausea I can’t handle. I’ve lost 20 lbs and weigh 105 on a good day. I just want my life back.

I am new to this forum and I am so glad I've found it. I've already read a bunch of different posts and I'm learning so much!  I come from a long line of women with gynecological issues. My mom had uterine   and only one working ovary, her mother had fibroids, and my great-great grandmother died of  . I know most pelvic issues are not inherited but I know you can have a genetic predisposition to them.  I got my first period 11 years ago when I was 12 (now I am 23). Up until four years ago, my periods were always relatively ""normal"" meaning moderate bleeding, mild cramps/fatigue and all my pain was managed with just ibuprofen. When I turned 19, my periods suddenly became irregular, going from two-three days long and a light flow some months, to super heavy, week long gore-fests with major mood swings/cravings and generalized body ache. For the last year however, my periods are very irregular, being light one month and heavy the next. When reading about  , I do exhibit most of the symptoms however the pain I experience is much different. The pain I have is not sharp, sudden stabbing pain, but rather the most intense dull deep ache that radiates throughout my pelvis, low/mid back and upper thighs. It feels as if someone is pulling my insides down/out/sideways, very, very slowly. The pain does not go away with stretching or ibuprofen and I am completely wiped of all energy with no thoughts of anything other than how badly my pelvis aches. This pain lasts about four days from the first day of my period. The rest of my cycle (not bleeding) I am relatively pain free with only moments of mind-blowing hyper-quick jolts of pain near where I think my ovaries are. It feels like a bubble is popping inside of me and the pain is over in about three seconds, but it takes my breath away.  Does anyone else have similar symptoms? Or am I crazy and this is just normal period pain? I have seen countless gynecologists who have told me to just take an anti-inflammatory but they don't help. I have been on tri-lynyah BC for about six years for my adult   which so far it helps with.  I am scared to have a laparoscopy done only to have them not find anything and just tell me that I'm over-reacting.  Any thoughts/ideas? Am I just a wimp or is there actually something going on?  1 like, 8 replies "

Please help. Open to any advice. ","Hello! I’m new here and was looking for anyone’s advice really on my current situation. I’m 25 and after years of going to the doctor with horrible pelvic pains and trouble with intercourse my doctor finally suggested an exploratory laparoscopy. I had it done last Monday which during the procedure he said he found extensive endo and “corrected it” by burning the tissue. He explained it was on both ovaries heavily and also on my pelvic wall where there was an unexplained large amount of free fluid. I came home to recover and was somewhat happy I had an actual reason for my pain (it wasn’t all in my head like others had said before). Tuesday evening I started having terrible cramps (charley horse like) in my right leg. I assumed it was surgery related and from what all I had just went through so I tried to alleviate it at home by taking meds, applying heat, elevation, etc. The cramping continued but the next day radiated to my other leg as well. It’s best described as an intense pinching feeling in my calf’s. Called my doctor that Thursday and explained and they had me go to the ER to be tested for blood clots which came back negative. All of my labs came back perfect as well no infection,  , or potassium issues. Now they are saying that they aren’t sure what could be going on and maybe I have nerve damage from surgery somehow. Where do I go from here? Am I stuck with this? I just want the pain to go away and I’ve tried anything and everything so I’d be happy to hear anyone’s input/ opinions. I’ve also read up on how endo can affect the sciatic nerve? Don’t know what truth there is to it but did the surgery hurt me in the long run? Hoping this goes away! 😣 0 likes, 0 replies "

Now the crazy part is that i dont understand how cardiologist do not have a clue how bad this drug affects people when they are coming off it, they litterally told me to just get off of it completely that i wouldnt need to wean..,.(holy crap) i knew that wasnt going to happen being that i have tried  weaning off this drug before with litterally no success! the effects i get from a tiny bit of cutting the pill by a 10th was horrible. For me it would raise my cortisol levels at night causing extreme panic.. like i thought i was for sure dead waking up at 3:30am !!!! This was litterally happening for months with no explanation and countless visits to the ER. After researching this drug and months later i finally figured the pill was the cause of high cortisol spikes at night/extreme panic attacks so i made sure my doses were exactly 2.5mg. Before i was just hoping to get the right cut by eye but of course that wasnt the case. Does anyone have any suggestions on weaning off Bisoprolol? How is life after getting off the drug? anything i should worry about? I go to the gym 4 times a week and notice the cortisol spikes at night get worse if i try weaning and still hit the gym. Im hoping to get off this pill completely sometime in 2018, i will be starting the wean jan 1st of the new year so im excited and scared at the same time and really would like some guidance. Oh yea i take Holy basil for the high cortisol at night which really makes a difference, thought id throw that out there in case anyone was going through the same thing! anything would help thanks 0 likes, 51 replies "

An   did show that I have a slight mitral valve reflux, but that this is not the  cause of the night-time palps. I found that taking the propanolol when I had the palpitations did no more good than sitting up or walking around for a while, so I stopped taking those and the anxiety pills. However, recently the problem was getting to me again and I thought I needed to do something, so I went back to see the cardio and was started on Betaloc (metoprolol). I soon began to get a tight feeling around my chest and numb arm/fingers, so I told the cardio and she changed me to Emconcor 2.5mg once a day (bisoprolol). Now I am getting flashing lights in my peripheral vision and I am convinced this is a side effect of these latest tablets. I saw a neurologist and he referred me for a   of my head, as I also get lots of optical migraines (not a headache, just a shimmering flashing spot that moves across my vision - I've been getting these for years, but was told they were nothing to worry about). I started taking the Betaloc in early September this year, and the Emconcor about three weeks ago, but I am seriously considering weaning off these tablets. I am not sure whether I can tolerate the original problem better than the side effects of the beta blockers. As I have not been taking them for that long, is it OK to stop these more quickly than if I had been on them a long time?

My father, a previously active 78 year old was prescribed bisprolol after a pacemaker was fitted in Sept last year. We were warned about possible side effects but nothing could have prepared us for how horrific they were. Cutting a long story short, once Dad’s prescription was upped, he started displaying symptoms similar to dementia. He was very quiet, but also very confused and struggled to get his words out. Over the coming weeks, he turned into a shell of the man he once was; barely any conversation, no personality and he just constantly hid behind his newspaper (but he didn’t appear to be reading it).  The worst came when he started to look for his mum....she died 50 years ago and he just couldn’t understand it when we told him this. Then he got my sister (his eldest daughter) and his wife (our mum) mixed up....then he started not recognising my mum altogether. To say this was hideous is an understatement - my poor mum, Sams age as him was caring for him but he didn’t know who she was. One day he even said to me ‘you can’t expect me to believe that’s my wife’.  As a family we were obviously distraught. My sister was convinced it was dementia, however it just didn’t seem that way to me. Eventually after a horrific 3 months, we frogmarched Dad to the GP and insisted they start withdrawing him from bisprolol. Within a week the difference was amazing - Dad was back! Within a fortnight he was practically back to his normal cheeky self and now it’s been 2 months he’s back to normal completely. The GP said it was likely hallucinations caused by these beta blockers and that some people can’t tolerate them but it was so much worse than that.  I’m writing this in case anyone is struggling to work out why their family member isn’t quite themselves - if I had read this at the time it would have given me hope.  1 like, 26 replies "
Bisoprolol,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/beta-blocker-bisoprolol-withdrawal-and-breathlessness-493734,Beta blocker/Bisoprolol withdrawal and breathlessness,"Hi. I am 43 yrs old and have been on beta blockers (initially metoprolol and then bisoprolol) for svt the last ten years. I had an ablation which went wrong and I ended up on higher doses of beta blocker after that (8yrs ago). They added in flecainide a year ago as they wanted to drop my bisoprolol down becacause I was still having daily runs and my BP was a bit on the low side. I have managed to drop the dose down to 1.25 bd over the last few months. Then 4 weeks ago, I started to have awful episodes of ?different kind of arrhythmia where i would feel very faint and shaky and it would last for a few minutes. Because they then wondered if I was having a ventricular arrhythmia, they stopped the flecainide and halved my bisprolol. However a week ago I had a couple of prolonged svt episodes so they stopped my beta blocker altogether and started me onto something new dronaderone (like amiodarone with less side effects). I was relieved at the thought of finally being off the beta blocker once and for all but all week I have steadily been feeling worse and worse. I know that there is likely to be a withdrawl period but it's been a week now and I can honestly say that I'm more breathless today than I've ever been. Even just sitting at rest. I can't talk or eat without stopping for breath all the time and I have never felt so unwell in all my life. I am aware that I can get marked postural tachycardia and if I so much as walk slowly to another room my rate climbs from 75 to 120 in seconds. Has anyone else experienced such marked side effects after stopping bisoprolol or another beta blocker? I would really appreciate any thoughts. R   2 likes, 266 replies "

I have been taking Bisoprolol Fumarate 5mg daily for the past 3 years following a frightening episode in town which resulted in my spending a week in the Cardiac ward of our local hospital.  I had SVT while in hospital and the 'specialists' couldn't actually put a cause to my soaring blood pressure and rapid heartbeat.  So, I've been told to stay on these tablets for life...  I'm 48 now, was 45 then. The comforting thing about reading the majority of these posts is that so many people are feeling ridiculous levels of tiredness; I don't recognise myself from 3 years ago.  This isn't whingeing, just stating a fact.  I have piled on the pounds - particularly blubby around my midriff - yet I eat less than ever.  I am sometimes so overcome by exhaustion that I have to stop even the most trivial of chores.  I have lost my 'get up and go', yet used to be so active with my three kids.  I used to be so house proud, yet now can'tbe bothered other than to 'keep on top' of the housework.  I used to love socialising, again, can't be bothered most of the time and when I do, I am glad when it is over.  I love the peace and quiet of my own company so much more now and feel exhausted by company.  Yet I AM ONLY 48 YEARS OLD!!!   I realise I am lucky to be alive, to be uncursed by serious ills, but still, it is healthy to have a little moan now and then, and gratifying to feel online empathy with other 'sufferers'.

Bisoprolol,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/bisoprolol-and-shortness-of-breath-696779,Bisoprolol and shortness of breath,"Hello, I am on bisprolol 2.5 mg for inappropriate sinus tachycardia, which was thought to have caused/exacerbated my shortness of breath (which was initially caused by severe anemia but persists despite normal Hb [but ferritin is low normal]) . The bisoprolol also brought down my diastolic BP which suddenly shot up a few weeks back. A few days before I started the bisoprolol, I felt some relief in the shortness of breath. No idea why/how. I've been on the  bisoprolol for 10 days now. While  my heart rate (between 70 and 80)  and BP are great, I am now having more shortness of breath than previously. I even have shortness of breath at rest. For the past few days, every time I take a nap I wake up feeling suffocated and have  . I am not gasping for breath, but I do wake up breathing faster and with a higher heart rate. I was concerned if this was symptom of heart failure, so I slept flat on my back last night without pillows. I didn't experience any shortness of breath or palpitations. My recent echo, nuclear stress test, chest x ray were all normal, and the only abnormality is the high heart rate caught on various ECGs and the holter. I am wondering if bisoprolol has anything to do with the shortness of breath and the suffocating feeling during naps. It's working so well for my heart rate and the diastolic BP (which was said to  have risen because of IST) that I don't want to go on another med asap. I also have t2 diabetes (well controlled, a1c of 4.9) that I can't use nonselective beta blockers as they raise BG.  I was on HCTZ which did nothing to lwoer my heart rate, and my diastolic mostly remained high on it, plus it raised  my fasting BG over which I like to keep tight control. but yes, if you have had worsening/new shortness of breath on bisoprolol, please share your experience. thank you. 1 like, 19 replies "

I recently went into status and was taken to resus where they injected me with diazepam and lorazepam which stopped the seizures. I was admitted to a ward and had a further 3 seizures which again they gave me Diazepam for. I later discharged myself and the doctor said i would need to go for a repeat EEG and a follow up with my neurologist. The whole time i was in hospital i felt paranoid like the doctors didn't believe my seizures were real but surely if they thought i was ""faking"" them they wouldn't have given me drugs?.

Epilepsy and Non-epileptic seizures,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/seizure-when-standing-up--681608,Seizure when standing up. ,"Approximately 4 years ago I went through a period of time where I got extremely light headed when standing and had blacked out vision and body tingling/numbness. These episodes caused me to have two seizures which I went to my GP about but they didn't seem too concerned about it which surprised me. Since then I have had occasional episodes of blacking out vision and tingling when standing but never full blown seizures. The majority of the time this is never an issue. Last week I began having increasingly worse episodes, along with pretty bad exhaustion as well,  I started taking my blood pressure during and after these episodes. It remained between 109-131 systolic and 71-100 diastolic with an average HR of 80. The readings were normal while sitting and rose slightly higher a period of time after these episodes. I managed to take 3 readings during the episodes 66/48 and 52/37 average HR: 150, the blood pressure readings obviously shocked me. During the third reading I actually had another full blown seizure, fell to my knees, limbs shaking and lost consciousness for about 3 seconds, during this time the BP monitor kept going up to 220+ and very slowly went down, then about two minutes after the seizure it gave me a reading of 82/53. I am a registered paediatric nurse so I am aware of both orthostatic hypotension and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, I believe it more likely to be the former. My question is: is it worth going to the doctors about this? I know there isn't much to be done and the GP wasn't too concerned the last time. I'm just concerned because it's been approximately an hour since the seizure and I just feel exhausted with a strange tingling in my head and limbs, mostly arms and almost light headed along with a feeling of being ""out of it"" and a general sort of off feeling so to speak. However the episodes stopped happening the last time they occurred and I have been under a lot of stress this week, extremely sleep deprived (staying up for 36hrs on two occasions then only getting 2-4hrs sleep to compensate.) and haven't been eating or hydrating very well. I have been recuperating today, I'm off work and have been eating/drinking and taking vitamins. Is there anything else I can do to prevent this happening again? I'm quite anxious about it happening at work or in public. Thank you for taking the time to read through my post and I appreciate any advice you may have to offer. 0 likes, 1 reply "

And I would really appreciate your comments, tips or guidance. I moved to Germany together with my husband 4,5 years ago. 4 years ago we had our little miracle come into this world, our daughter. It was the best thing that had ever happened to us, after all we've been through in our lives...it was a very long awaited child, a true gift. Everything finally started making sense, all the tough times seemed to be behind, and we were so happy despite being sleepless  And here it started.  Bit by bit I was “drowning"". Postpartum depression they told me. I was so demotivated, so disconnected from this world, from my family. I felt ashamed for not being able to do simple things like calling a doctor’s office, taking care of the bills and so on. I felt worthless. I felt ashamed for not feeling happy, for not wanting my husband, for not enjoying life despite all the things happening around me. I was getting deeper and deeper under my shell. The world was blurry and at some point things started feeling unreal.  We were sleepless for 1,5 years in a row. My husband said that it couldn’t go on like that anymore, and began to rescue me and us from the zombie land. I stopped breastfeeding, he took care of the daughter’s night sleep. Bit by bit, it took us about 6 months to recover more or less, but depression was still there. With a great push and help of my family I started working again, they feared that otherwise things would’ve got critical for my mental health. I started a completely new role - from previously customer supporting role to the proactive one, working in sales. Things felt quite stressful and new. A few months after the job's start, I began to feel changes within me. I felt kind of superior to other people, super self assure, my self esteem and belief in myself were as high as never before. I had lots of energy like never before. I started sleeping less (could be 4 hours vs “a post must have 8-9, and no issues)"", dressing more sexy, began to attract attention from people, and enjoyed this state quite a lot. Life seemed to be blossoming. All of a sudden I learned how to laugh - I never really laughed in my life, just smiled, as if I wasn’t physically able to. All of a sudden there I was laughing. I didn’t find it strange, I found it awesome. Then I met someone. It was a formal meeting in the first place (we’re in the same industry). Then he started telling me about polygamy and other bullsh…For some reason my brain accepted this information. It felt like I was on a constant high, not criticising things, taking everything easy, not taking into consideration serious and important things that we were discussing with my husband at that time. All in all it felt as if I was 15 or so. Then we started chatting. The world of polygamy, sex chats, cheating, porn, phantasies, ideas etc. - felt as if there was a second me that was living in that world.  Before I was the kind of person who preferred not to lie, it was simply too stressful and felt so wrong, that I would worry about a little lie like crazy. However this time it was different. I lied like a professional poker player. I was lying to my family's face all the time. Making things up so fast and naturally. The complexity of my lies was pretty high. During 1 year after I met this person I did terrible things… Lying, cheating, self admiration, photos&videos of myself, masturbation in different places, living in a phantasy world, not paying attention to my family, again lies lies lies…and oh cheating with more than just that guy. It felt as if there was a hungry beast was sitting inside of me. I was remorseless, cold, hunting, playing…All in all during the past year I had 5 men, 3 of which I slept with (2 times unprotected!), 2 kissed. The beast was unstoppable and was growing and getting more and more hungry. I was scared to death and excited at the same time. I told myself more and more often that I have to stop all this, but I couldn’t. The more I told myself that I have to stop, the worse it got.. to the point of being unbearable - all my mind would get filled 100% with the idea of chats, phantasies etc. Then my husband found out. I felt pretty crazy - it was a conference in our home town, and lasted 2 days. Day1 I slept with one guy, day 2 with another guy and in the evening flirting with the third one. In the meantime our daughter was sick. I didn’t think about anyone, didn’t think about any risks, just some crazy ideas of having sex with these people swirling in my head. He was devastated. We spoke several days non stop. He was trying to find out the truth, and I just wouldn’t let it all out. It was about 20 stories in total that I told him, releasing more important details as I went. I still felt hyper sexual at that point in time, still checking out men on the streets, still feeling like texting that guy. It took my husband some time to get me out of there. It was him to suspect me being ill. After going to a psychiatrist I was diagnosed with Bipolar II and started taking meds. After a few weeks on medication I started feeling a bit better, closer to normal.  We’ve been together with my husband for 18 years, and we’re the only family we’ve got (no relatives, no real friends). I broke his heart and betrayed my family... Now we’re divorcing and I question myself all the time - Why did I do it all? Why didn’t I stop/confess? Now I’m in the phase where I’m so deep under water, that I can’t see any bits of light. Sometimes, once every two weeks or so, I get out of there, it feels like jumping out of the water: again having lots of energy, loads of optimism and great mood all of a sudden, start believing in myself, have an increased productivity at work, increased libido and desire to dress up etc. It usually lasts 1-2 days, and then I drown again quite suddenly and rapidly. Apart from that I also have a strange paranoia that all men out there want to either sleep with me or have no good intentions. I get very overwhelmed by sounds and people very fast, communication is difficult. I’m also like a walking juke box, the loads of tracks playing and rotating in my head are wearing me off. It started a year ago and it just got much worse. And oh, I feel as if I have no personality, that I’m a walking blank disc. Most of the days I feel completely disconnected from the world, and feel no emotions at all. I’m sure this all isn’t normal, but have no clue what exactly is the reason. What scares me is that this strange condition is getting worse, and I have no answers so far...   I know I’ve said a lot. Sorry there’s been so much on my mind. I desperately need to understand:  1) if it was just hypomania, why didn’t I stop? ( I had no hallucinations or super rapid speech, they think it’s bipolar II) 2) how come my family didn’t notice any weird behaviour at home, I was a “perfect” liar 3) how could my husband stop mania just with conversations (it was very tough but still, I thought that normally one in mania doesn’t stop without meds, and goes all the way to the abyss until he ends up in a hospital) 4) why in the world didn’t I direct my hyper sexuality onto my husband, why did I need to cheat? 5)what can be happening with me apart from bipolar if bipolar at all?  Really appreciate your comments. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I had it ever since I was 16 but never realised until today where I’m 21 almost 22 July 25th,  I think at the time I was kidda like a rapper I loved the hype of the crowds. Especially when I was the first kid to rap in school assembly history  Like I always thought i was just normal and motivated individual but I would have excessive amount of me listening to music on my ear phones getting out of reality and pretending I was famous. I have been heart broken countless times in which I try to recover and improve.  I think inside I always wanted like a nice girl friend to feel a sense of peace and calmness  Along time ago when I was a popular guy in my school because of music i basically wasn’t that interested in parties and I think that’s why it was short lived that’s one thing that annoys me my wins in life are short lived for the amount of effort I put in Anyways I lost my reputation about more than 6 years ago and from that day on I was like  Oh these British ppl betray me now ima go join the Chinese  So Yh that was the start of my 2015 journey 3 years after losing my rep  In that year I found love of my life, that I was focused on a lot and making a ton of friends from China and Hong Kong even learning there language etc and Yh i was very proud because it’s not easy making it in these groups because sometimes there’s racism within Asian communities  Anyways I’m someone which is a life coach and I inspire to become a famous actor and if I do become that I want to create a group of elite life coaches to just do more justice for men which have been having dating problems socialising, fitness etc and il have coaches for women too cause they deserve help as well. I was born in Uk but basically I’m Vietnamese, Vietnam right now is kidda underrated and under respected in a sense that’s why I wanna become famous to boost the reputation of my country  But Yh there’s also a side of me that likes to show off because I feel like I do myself justice with what I go through and the effort level I put out there for instance I like to imagine me and a group of friends which I helped become more powerful just in the club with some nice girls in our circle, champagne bottles with good rap music in the background.  So Yh that’s my story I hope anyone that has this will be able to manage.  So guys in your opinion would you say I have Bipolar 2 Thanks.  0 likes, 4 replies "

","I don’t know wether anyone could help me understand and stop the sleepless nights and emotions running high but here it goes.... I have been with my Girlfriend for a year now and everything has been amazing, she has two kids of which we all get on very well. I adore them like my own and they adore me. She was going through a divorce and separation when we met of which isn’t the best of situations but our connection and time we all spent with Eachother made it worth it. Divorce is a sticky situation especially when kids are involved and when the other party refuses to sign the papers. Knowing the situation I was getting myself into I never put any pressure on anything and always spoke highly of the kids dad and always made it sound fun that it was “daddy’s weekend”  Our relationship has gone from strength to strength of which led to talking about the future.  Recently a few things have happened of which wasn’t normal and resulted into me questioning what was wrong.  We spent Sunday with each other and Monday she delivered me dinner and work and Tuesday she brought the kids in to see me and asked to go out for a meal. We all went for a lovely family meal and the kiddies wanted a sleepover. So I stayed at their house that night. We got into bed and I asked a couple of questions of which I noticed recently that didn’t seem right. Things never really got answered and then at 4pm whilst I was at work on Wednesday I got a message which was basically saying she is so stressed out and she can’t drag me along with her. This came to a big surprise for me, of which resulted into walking out of work and feeling lost.  After speaking to family and relatives everyone found it hard to believe that it was going to be the end of the road for us. We had a few messages to and from and then I was told to give her space. Which is the hardest thing ever, especially when they have become such a big part of my life. I haven’t been sleeping or eating for 5 days now and I just never know if she’s going to come back. Our relationship was amazing we have never argued and we always have an amazing time with one another.  I eventually heard from her 4 days later of which resulted into meeting up. I couldn’t talk in this depth just via text.  I met her and we both feel into each others arms for about 5mins with just tears and no words.  We sat down and spoke about things and I mentioned a post on Instagram that had a few hashtags relating to mental health. I asked her about this of which resulted into more tears.  Cut a long story short, I’ve known my girlfriend for a year and have come across this once. We don’t live together so I’m not always there.  We have decided that I should give her space with no communication or contact, until she is ready.  I have done a little research since finding this out and everything is starting to make since, but I do wonder will she ever come back. I am a very supportive and caring man of which makes it even harder for me.  We have decided not to move anything out of each other’s houses yet and the kids don’t know. I am willing to stand by her and support her as much as she needs. My love for her hasn’t changed one bit, but will she ever come back..... 0 likes, 0 replies "

I used to get bullied, 3/4 grand parents died, my dog ran away and within a month my dad went to prison. Only being nine I was confused and all but I attempted   by noose, it didn’t work as you can see but I was unconscious for about 3 minutes and my mother saved my unconscious almost dead body from death. Ever since I’ve had really bad issues involving anger, depression, trust issues, horrible flash backs, and I can even sometimes hear voices that I just try to push out of my head. My anger is my biggest concern, I try my best to keep a situation calm when it’s reached a certain point so it doesn’t escalate, it usually does and it makes me go insane. For instance two days ago me and my close nephew had our worst fight yet, he was in the hallway (he’s older than me btw) with his hands up and I lost my mind. I started screaming.. over and over again I was just screaming no words just hate as loud my blacked out body could while punching walls doors and him. It was an insane argument and my head couldn’t take being called psycho over and over again.  I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder but I’m not sure all of my symptoms fall under that spectrum. I’m wondering if I developed ptsd from the incident.. these flash backs I get are so horrible, and every time I see anybody hung in a movie I wanna cry my  in eyes out in shame. I hear voices, randomly throughout the day.. sometimes it’s my name sometimes it’s violent words. My house is 2 bedroom and my dad is pretty abusive.. my mom and him got into a fight like 3 months ago and she had to sleep with me. I woke up from feeling violent shaking and heard mumbling to listen a little over the fan it’s her shaking chanting “HELL HELL HELL HELL HELL HELL” and it seemed so real, the clock was accurate I was sitting up when it ended and had to sit back down to go back to sleep so it had me really freaked out. I was defiant of Christianity about 2 months ago, even made fun of it and with my current mental state I may have f****d myself. I’ve been making serious changes lately but people in my home are all changing for the worse while I’m becoming better dragging me down further. I’m a Christian now, I attend church and I pray daily. I’m worried I have much more wrong with me than people know and I have no idea what to do. 0 likes, 4 replies "

I just discovered that after taking multiple tests from different sites on the internet, i may have Mild to severe BP disorder. Problem is, where i live, there is no such thing. U are either considered Insane or Just whinny if u know what i mean. They are no good places to go to for advice, meds or anything mental beyond depression and total mental breakdowns so im sure there is no chance for me getting meds or let alone start depending on them for lack of a constant supply and financial issues, plus my family would surely not lend a hand even when they are fully capable.  I feel useless even though im good at a lot of things, i repeatedly think of my failures, i don't think i like myself sometimes, i wish i lived differently, I failed my girlfriend who loved me a lot that she ended up cheating and its been a year now but i still think and loose a few tears over her now and then, My little confidence was completely destroyed, I feel better people could have lived in my place even though i am happy for nothing sometimes. I live in a very judgmental small society and i always feel like the awkward one and im afraid one day, i might have the courage, disappointment, impulse or anger to do it. However, i know once i start meds i might make it worse and i cant get them everytime since im sure there is no such thing as lithium in my town apart from the scientific element. At-least the alcohol helps but i cant manage to buy it everyday coz i cant even wrap my head around responsible spending. I know im a ticking time bomb but i am willing to work on it because i would sell my soul for a good, normal life like everyone else.  Please someone tell me if there is things i can do without the medicine to treat myself or rather if its the only way so i can try to make ways of getting them. Sorry for the long verse but i have no where else to go. I need your advice guys 1 like, 6 replies "
Bipolar Affective Disorder,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/have-i-got-bipolar--672210,Have I got Bipolar ?,"I have had depression and anxiety for 10years now. I have beeb on medication for them for 6 years and have started CBT this year for the first time. This has been happening a lot over the years but only really noticed it this year.  Ill start about this year. Christmas time, was fine. Around 2nd or 3rd Jan I felt down and was depressed, I tried going out and exercising and doing things what i liked doing, but nothing. I referred myself to cbt wanting to get better. Probably from Jan through till early May I was depressed. I had a few days when i felt “normal” in April as I was looking forward to watching wrestling with my brother so that was like a 6 day. So probably in that time I was between normal and more positive. Then I was depressed again. Through till Juneish when I started to feel “normal” again.  Late June my parents went on holiday so it was just me and my brother. I was more positive and outgoing. I had saved some money up. More talkative and a few other things. That week I ended up spending the savings. On the Friday, we was watching Glow season 2 and I started to feel depressed again and i tried to forget about it. I was expecting to feel a little down because I had enjoyed that week. Since then I have been depressed. I am having CBT now and have been going since June.  When I say depressed I have been feeling sad, down, like a failure, comparing myself to others, putting myself down, thinking i dont want to be here, no motivation, not feeling anything bar negative emotions and a few others. 8 days as of writing my second cousin died. I am close with the majority of the family and i was close to her. I noticed that when i was told I didnt feel anything. Sunday into Monday I started feeling more positive. I was talking more, not sleeping much and not being tired. Struggling to concentrate on 1 thing at a time. Feeling like I could do anything. As well as a few other things but one was I was getting irritated And angry really easily which is not like me. My family noticed this as well Friday I snapped at my dad and that has broken my positive mood as I keep thinking I shouldnt have done that. When I snapped back at my family during in the week I did not care.  Now I am feeling depressed again. On a scale of 1-10 when i was feeling positive I would say 8. On a scale of 1-10 when I was depressed I would say 2. Id say 2 because 0 doesn’t count and 1 would be   and attempting   and i did think about how easy it could be to hurt myself because of the thoughts in my head but never acted on them. Id say 8 for positive as I was more talkative and other things, but I had a voice in my head every now and then questionsing myself.  Also when I was more positive I was quick at making decisions compared with feeling depressed Id let other people make decisions. Because of CBT I have got some “homework” to do to help and i have been doing it.  Should I bring this up with her? I havr wrote down on a piece of paper what i was feeling wheb positive and depressed  0 likes, 1 reply "
Bipolar Affective Disorder,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hypomanic-or-just-having-a-brilliant-time--679463,Hypomanic or just having a brilliant time?,"Sorry, a bit on the long side, but really need opinions if this was a hypomanic episode? In 2004 I went backpacking to Australia. Back then it wasn’t the way it is now.  Far more chilled.  I was 24. I’ve to say I’m on the quiet side and not into alcohol or heavy parting at all. I love having sitting together with others and chatting about this and that. Not that I don’t enjoy the odd drink now and then, but def wldn’t have more than a couple of drinks at the most. When I went to Australia I actually was in a relationship and the plan was to settle back into my “old” life after the year. I wouldn’t be really someone who spontaneously decides on life changing decisions. Or you wouldn’t call me reckless. I can make spontaneous decisions, but never reckless. Would be probably think about important things twice before committing. Thinking back, I’d say I had a “low” phase in Australia. Ice stayed on a farm and somehow  managed to withdraw and isolate myself. It was out of season and all the work that was there was tidying up and preparing for the next season. So, no other backpackers really. I’ve joined the local library and spend my free days reading in bed avoiding other people. The only reason why it wasn’t that bad was that the family I was working for literally mad me attend barbies and joint them for dinner.  After staying for three months on the farm I’ve “suddenly” decided to spend 1500 $ on a s****y car. Money I actually didn’t have. Put it onto the credit card. Suddenly I had another 4 backpackers willing to travel from Perth to Darwin. Within a couple of days my bags were packed and we were hitting the road.  I’ll never forget that feeling. It was hot. Music was blaring out of cheap speakers. There was no roof lining in the car. It was boiling hot. The airstream from the windows bring barely any relief. It was f...ing BRILLIANT. I just loved every second of being on the road.  In one of the National Park I was approached by a ranger. The gang were down in a gorge while I was lying hangover on one of the picnic benches. My drinking has spiraled out of control. We were drinking cheap wine. Buckets of it. Me who can not even drink half a bottle. Anyway, like in “Wolf Creek” we got invited to his house for a Barbie and beds. No comment. As it was me who said yeah. Well, luckily it was just freakish and nothing happened. Ok. It was mega freakish and now I can half laugh about it. When we’ve finally arrived into Darwin we didn’t go to a hostel but checked into a campsite. The partying continued. A six pack every night. Music. Chatter. Fun. Party. Every nite we went to bed around 1-2am and got up at 6am. Too hot in the tents and aside that we had s****y backpacker jobs waiting for us. Once on the way to a waitress job I got stopped by the police. I had some wine before I left for work and you barely can drink in Australia before losing your license. Well, I don’t know how, but I did talk myself out of it. I was over the limit. Another time I’ve broken red lights and the police came after me. Definitively wasn’t thinking straight. But again. I’ve talked myself out of it.  During that time I literately went on the “hunt” for “male blood”. Nightclubs. Can’t stand them normally. Well, one night stands are also not my cup of tea but I did manage to have four in four weeks hahaha. Not so proud of it at all. Ok. I never would sleep around like that. I just remember being horny all the time. Then I’ve met my partner. And decided he is THE ONE. He was dating another girl which didn’t stop me. I still can’t believe that I did that. But, yes. He ended up mine. Somehow I lost it then. I was supposed to fly home two weeks later, but booked my return flight to Australia. Put it onto my famous credit card . Yep.  I’ve know that lad for three weeks max!  I’ve moved to a foreign country because of him! On the positive side, we’re still together 12 years later and we have a family, but that was a bit very spontaneous.  Somewhere in between I got a perm, broke up with my then boyfriend of five years.  Shocked my parents by telling them I won’t be coming back.  The whole lot lastet maybe 3 months. I never went that bananas since then. On the other hand I might have self medicated by smoking a bit too much week. My lows were never really really low. I could cope and get out of bad and go to work. And as I’m more on the happy side most days anyway, no one would have noticed too much when I was bouncing around which I know I can do.  I’ve never realised it before but I have tons of routines set up and they might have just kept me as grounded as possible. So, what the f**k happened in Australia? Just a brilliant time or was it hypomanic? Opinions please :D 0 likes, 0 replies "

Have posted alot these past couple of weeks.  (Under venlafaxine). Have been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 recently (wrongly diagnosed with unipolar depression last year and this year and treated with   which made things worse).  Tapering off venlafaxine and was prescribed quetiapine a few weeks ago. Was really unwell this morning with hardly any emotions, slowed thinking and additional anxiety.  Felt even more detached than previously and had to get in touch with a CPN.  Luckily I got to see a psychiatrist (this was a pre-arranged appointment but I had never received a letter to tell me to attend!) . I (and my CPN) only discovered this when he was trying to contact the psychiatrist urgently.  My psychiatrist has changed me from quetiapine (after 4wks trial) as he feels it is to blame for flattened emotions and slowed thinking while the anxiety is caused by the venlafaxine.  He wishes to taper off the remaining 75mg of venlafaxine after I have been balanced on my new med. It's called Aripiprazole. Has anyone had success with this medication? Any replies would be a real help as feel like I'm on a bit of a rollercoaster ride at the moment. Thank you in advance.  1 like, 6 replies "

Also, I got a feeling of my eyes and tongue burning, muscle stiffness. This remained for 2 months. I have visited few neurology doctors and they did not have any solution. In September 2018 I told about my symptoms to my psychiatric. He suggested starting using respirdal again. From the first pill in less than 12 hours I start feeling 95% normal and all of the above symptoms were gone except little pain in shoulder and heavy right hand. The doctor thought it is depression pain and he gave me pill  Cyprilix. I did not get well and my doctor gave me Cymbalta and I started feeling pain in different areas like legs front and back, shoulder, eyes, and back. Mean I dropped to be only 60-70% normal feeling of the body. I visited few doctors and they are not aware of the right treatment and they informed that they have never heard about such side effects of respidral. I would like to know if any of any patient using respidral reported such cases and what is the correct treatment. Thank you. 0 likes, 1 reply "

I love him","Where to start. I work with a man who suffers from bipolar. We've been talking closely, and romantically for about 5 months. Pretty much daily. He was lovely, kind, funny, caring, a really decent guy, finally!! He asked me to go out for drinks with him and we were going to arrange it. He even encouraged me to get a new role in the firm in the same team as him which is a role I had been gearing up towards. I got the job, he was really happy. In February he became distant. Messaged less and didn't mention the date. Referred to me as a former friend on some occasions. He admitted depressed feelings on a couple of occasions, saying life would always be hard. 2 weeks ago I started my new role in the same team. He seemed more upbeat but different..... He's very flirty with the girls, they are married. He talks about sex. He talks about who is hot in the office. He does not stop talking, humming, joking. Seems to be sat on his phone all day watching videos or messaging. He's took a loan for a motorbike out, and is buying a new TV. Hes rude to me, called me a psycho a couple of times. But then he will message early in the morning or at night like he cares. My phone died one night and when I charged it I had 37 messages saying are you there, are you OK, are you upset etc Friday was the last straw. I had to work 8 hours where he did not stop talking. To everyone but me. He commented about a girl he had a dream about in the office. He had messaged one girl to save him a seat in the office next to her. She's married with a child. He was emailing another as I saw the email on her screen. I was sat next to her. He was purposely ignoring me and playing mind games. After work I checked his Instagram and he started following the girl from work. He follows a number of scantily clad porn star style women on there which I wouldn't normally be bothered about but coupled with his behaviour I got angry and blocked his instagram. I calmed a few hours later. I unblocked him but realised he had found a way to block me while he was blocked. He hasn't blocked me on whatsapp. I'm ashamed, hurt, confused. I thought I'd found the perfect guy and I helped him through the depressed bit, picked him up when he felt down. He said I was amazing, kind, beautiful, smart. Now I'm nothing.

Blepharitis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/blepharitis-i-cured-it-and-am-so-relieved-676354,Blepharitis- I cured it and am so relieved ,"Hi  I’m just posting this because I know how awful Blepharitis is and how debilitating this condition is.  I don’t how it started I just remember waking up in the mornings with pink eyes my right eye more pink than my left. The lower lash line also red I looked tired and as if I’d been crying all the time . I thought I was just tired then I noticed my eyelids and inner eye corners itching like hell. I was always rubbing my eyes. This horrible feeling always there led to to my eyes actually feeling dirty and itchy and my sight seemed blurry and the foreign body sensation was so horrible, and it was all the time. My eyes just randomly went red and then pink and then red but never back to a nice white eyeball. I finally reached my wits end by then I was fed up depressed and walking around with a really angry red eye that was not getting better. I went to the doctor and she sent me home with allergy eyedrops. No improvement went back came home with steroid drops used them for two weeks ....no improvement. By this time I had red small puffy swollen eyes and I was finding my self looking at them throughout the day. Almost obsessed it’s all I could think about so back I went this time to eye a&e. Six hours later I’m told I should never have been taking steroid drops and that I had Blepharitis and mgd. Prescribed dry eye drops and warm compresses and lid hygiene ie. baby shampoo !! Told I had it for life and I was devasted.  Was I really meant to deal with what they called a minor condition for life , surely they couldn’t be so casual about this, it’s a condition that affects your life so much. Refused to accept it but started with the programme they had advised. The warm compress made it worse eyes more puffy and pink. The eye drops only helped for a short time. I felt sick everytime I looked in a mirror and I looked in the mirror a lot , a vicious circle of discomfort and worry. Then I Was visiting my mum one day and was whinging about my eyes she also had noticed the state of them.  She went to the cupboard and pulled out just a jar Of standard normal honey. She said I’m going to put this on your eyes and it’s going to sting for about 5 minutes. I refused I said are you crazy things are bad enough as it is. Even the odd eye lash had started to come out nowadays.  She scolded me she said back in the days in India they didn’t go to doctors or buy expensive drops and scrubs they just whacked some honey in thier eyes. I did know my mum does this and my dad and have been for years and years for just general eye health. So I thought what the hell let’s just do it. She took a metal eye liner stick (you get them in Indian kajol bottles ) she disinfected it took a spoon of honey out of the jar doused the metal thing in it and then she swiped across my lower lash line as if applying kajol and then swiped some across the eye lid too and then she practically massaged it all over my eyes.  The stinging and burning was horrendous, oh my days it was so uncomfortable I couldn’t open my eyes they were watering so much. When I could open them for a second I had a hand mirror in front of me and all I could see was pink eyes. I remember screaming mum what have you done. I can’t see there going red ! She laughed and said stay like that for 15 minutes then go wash them with a clean flannel one for each eye.  15 minutes later I washed my eyes and omg the relief it immediately felt better , and no pink eyes. And most amazingly of all my eyes looked like glass and felt so good and omg my vision felt so clear..... it felt like a new lease of life. I carrried on and to this day I still do it once a week. My eyes are white clear and shiny my lashes are think and back to how they used to be. I have no problems now. I wear eye make up all the time but I make sure my eyes are clean and everything is off properly before bedtime. I don’t use my dry eye drops anymore I don’t need them I cancelled my repeat prescription from the doctors.  My mum also gave me some kind of other thing to wash my eyes with apparently they use in India for inflamed eyes I have to chop a bit of it off mix it in water and let it foam up then I wash my eyelids with it rinse off and done I do that about twice a week.   All I can say is I know how hard this situation is I know first hand how it affects you menatally and pysically. And if anyone’s was worse than mine then I don’t even want to think how you manage. I just want people who have Blepharitis to just please try honey , seriously , it’s an ancient old remedy used in India. And stick with it it stings it burns but once that subsides the relief is just so amazing. Thanks mum I always turn my nose up at your herbal remedies but mums know what they’re talking about !  Please try honey ! And all of those suffering from Blepharitis...don’t give up don’t let it get you down , do something about it that’s not text book advice from just the doctors. Because if I hadn’t listened to my mum right now I would probably be still popping drops in through out the day buying eyelid wipes shampoos and god knows what else because I am one of those people who doesn’t give up and I would probably have been trying any product on the market to just make it better.  It’s never come back, but I do my honey thing once a week no matter what and if I have a special occasion , just to get those eyes bright white and sparkly.  Wishing you all the will power to keep going until you find what works for you. 4 likes, 18 replies "

Blepharitis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/unexplained-vision-issues-622769,Unexplained vision issues,"I've been through complete hell for the past 6 months! This first started 12 years ago. I was in high school, 15 or 16 years old. Woke up with these weird blind spots throughout my vision. Thought it was an optical   because I got those a lot then. But it wouldn't go away. After two days my mother brought me to the e.r. and I got told it was   and sent home. This lasted about 6 weeks and went away. Fast-forward 3 years it happened again. I was home from school on break sitting on our front porch. Looking across the street at our neighbors house I noticed I only saw half the house. Everything I looked at had chunks gone. Not black spots, but it was just non existent. Again, thought it was a migrainewent to lay down, fell asleep for a few hours woke up and it was horrible. I was terrified of these vision problems coming back. This lasted a few months and slowly resolved. I was fine for 2 years. Life was great! I got done with school, got into a great relationship and had a healthy baby girl August of 2010. About March of 2011 I started having vision problems again. This time was different. Things got really blurry, I was seeing double off and on and I had a lot of really spotty vision Constantly but I had some days better than others. I saw an ophthalmologist who said my eyes are great. Sent to a neurologist and had a complete work up. MRI /lumbar puncture/EEG/vep. Nothing was found. Between appointments, about 4 months after this started, thing slowly got better and again, I was fine. But April 2013 it started again. I noticed a pattern, every time this happened it got a lot worse. This time I got it all. Blurry vision , spotty vision , double vision, weak and dimmed vision, eye pain, and whenever I woke up, my eyes would roll around uncontrollably for several minutes. I noticed a huge blind spot that never went away. Usually they would come and go all day. I saw the eye doctor again and I had a retinal hemorrhage. It healed but the blind spot remains to this day. I had a complete workup again with my eye doctor and saw a new neurologist. They repeated all of the same tests and everything was normal. I couldn't work anymore. I was terrified again that I'm loosing my vision. But after this completely overwhelming 6 month, thing started getting better. I was fine until July 2017. I was driving home from work, it was 12am. I noticed I couldn't see parts of the road. I made it home and had a full blown panic attack which caused me to pass out. I woke up at 7am the next morning in panic and got a ride to the hospital. This time I got it all again. Blurry vision , spotty vision , double vision, weak and dimmed vision, eye pain, and whenever I woke up, my eyes would roll around uncontrollably for several minutes. I got sent to see an eye doctor and everything was fine with my eyes. Immediately got sent to a neurologist. He repeated all the testing I've had done and everything was normal again. I noticed a big blind spot in my right eye again, and it didn't go away. Went back to the eye doctor and he found another retinal hemorrhage. He said its due to high blood pressure but the visual issues he still can't explain. So I have two huge blind spots in my right eye for life I guess. I saw my gp and he started blood pressure meds but insisted besides the hemorrhages that my blood pressure isn't causing my vision issues. I also have been diagnosed with severe sleep apnea and low iron anemia with no blood loss. My diet is and always has been iron rich. But the neurologist eye doctor and gp says none of this should be causing these vision problems. I'm still going through it and it's not going away. I keep hoping it will. Again I'm out of work and my life is a mess. Constantly anxious and depressed and just scared. Any ideas on what keeps happening to me I would be forever grateful.   0 likes, 4 replies "

Try it it's easy. ,"ALOEEYE: A solution for my 60 plus year acceptance and defiance of Demodex blepharitis infestation of my eyelashes. For 60 years I have suffered with this daily frustration. I had tried all, and nothing had worked. Until Aloe. 25 weeks ago while cleaning a fresh aloe vera, Aloe blepharitis, I applied a small piece of the freshly cut leaf to my eyes, as well as my face and hands. I knew that aloe has properties that are beneficial to ones skin. I said maybe, why not, it's one of many, blah blah, and said this may work to minimize the Demodex blepharitis that was been my longest frenemy. The next morning on awakening and doing my daily ritual of eye attack, I noticed less crumble. Odd. I did not think of the results for the rest of the day. The same day I prepared another Aloe to drink and again used the skins still containing gel to bathe my eyes and face and hands letting the gel dry in place. There was no irritation from the Aloe gel that was left on the skin or eyes. The next morning on initiating my daily eye ritual I noticed virtually no eye crumble. This time I said maybe the Aloe is responsible. I said this with an assurance as NOTHING HAD WORKED in the past. So. This third day I did the same with a freshly cut leaf that had drained of it's latex, the yellow liquid that flows so freely from the leaf when cut for several hours. NOTE, the latex is an irritant and a laxitive so be aware. My eyes, face and hands were once again bathed in Aloe gel. The next morning it was conclusive that the Aloe had vanished the mites. Even less than the virtually no mites of the previous morning. For 25 weeks now I have been applying the gel some days on some days off but consistently over 80% of the days Aloe was used. I would even apply the gel 3 to 5 days a day from the skins of the cut aloe. To date, 4 Oct 2017, no irritation of eyes, face or hands. AND NO MITES. NO Eye Crumble.  Will this work on all I do not know. I do know it worked and continues to work for me. Hope this helps many. PAZ from Chiapaz, Mexico UPDATE  Today, 4 October 2017. I am still free of Demodex blepharitis. I have reduced my application of the Aloe gel to two to three times a week. Today I also began a test of the effectiveness of the Aloe in threating Demodex blepharitis on my twin sons, aged 5 years 9 months. I will apply the gel three times a day for one week. I will take photos of the eyelashes each day. I took a photo today before the first application.  PAZ  0 likes, 18 replies "

It could be due to years of contact lens wear (which I had to stop years ago because my eyes couldn't handle them anymore), but I was just wondering if it may be the Blepharitis. If any of you have the same problem, is there anything that worked for you to make them less visible? Thanks. 0 likes, 13 replies "

I use one q-tip for each eye.After 15 minutes I rub in little honey on my eyelid and I just leave it or wash it.At the night I do same procedure like morning routine and still flare up again..😢 0 likes, 2 replies "
