Am going absolutely crazy with worry :(,"Ok so let me tell you a story. Apologies for the length Thursday 14th March i met a lady that id been talking to for months and met a couple of other times just socially, we met and had lunch..and we booked a room in a place with a private booth. Now before i went in the booth i went into the toilet and washed my penis with some handwash that was in the restroom (haha stupid i know!) that was strongly perfumed on the sink and was dark orange in colour..i put lots on all over the head of my penis without even diluting it with water! and to be honest don't think i washed it off properly...i did rinse a bit but not fully and some stayed on my penis head Anyway things got heated and she ended up with my penis in her mouth for around 10 seconds..that was it. I also put my fingers inside her vagina. Nothing else happened on the day apart from LOADS of kissing, deep french tongue kissing (literally loads) So the next day (Friday), i notice a bit of a painless rash on my penis head, like little spots or pimples. Now to add another dimension to this i have suffered from a fungal jock itch condition in my groin, and i am constantly constantly scratching it...ive suffered with this on and off for years..and might well have scratched and then touched the head of my penis inspecting it etc (i was inspecting it and pulling the foreskin back a lot on the Friday)..Saturday the spots started to fade..by Sunday they had completely gone and then on the Monday morning i noticed a little bit of burning near the opening and right underneath my peehole. NO other symptoms..nothing on the glans. So i spoke to her and she is mortified...she had a coldsore a week earlier that had dried up and dropped off and completely healed 2 days before we met(she even went to the pharmacist earlier that week and the pharmacist said it had completely healed and there was nothing there (as we wanted to kiss loads)..she had no symptoms of anything, she has had no sexual contact since last October (with her husband) and she split with her husband at In January (due to him being unfaithful)..again with no symptoms of anything So i got some canesten (thrush cream) and been putting that on, Smothering it all over and the burning although its not really burnining was just a slightly uncomfortable feeling, had been getting better..but now i think smothering my penis in canesten has also made it a bit sensitive..there is a slight bit of red irritation, no lesions or anything. So i go to the doctor...he takes a look and says this is nothing to do with herpes (i exlained everything to him) and that i have dermatitis. So gives me some Daktakort..i dont read the instructions and smother my penis head in it...which seems to make it worse...as in red dots under the glands skin (nothing raised) when i squeeze it, like little dots or blood vessels. I then read instructions and apparently you are only supposed to put it on thinly as it thins the skin and can cause irritation. In the meantime i go for an STI screen (two weeks after the 14th)..see the sexual health nurse who explains..the encounter was a risk..but a low one given the circumstances..she looks at my penis under a spotlight and cant see any lesions and says dermaitits is likely due to the stupid idea of putting strong perfumed and probably alcoholic handwash all over my penis and says with all the anxiety and stress if sores were going to come out they would have by now...and that also a lot of my symtpoms could be down to stress and anxiety Of course all this time my anxiety is going through thew roof..every little itch, feeling of warmth is amplified by ten. I was getting some warmth and a burning sensation between my scrotum and anus..no lesions or rash..but i do sit all day...so started to think i had prostate problems due to stress Have now started putting the daktakort back on and it feels slightly better but it still looks like there are tiny red small dots under the skin of the glans...and it still burns slightly from time to time with an occasional itch. Ive never felt ill, never got the flu...dont ever remember having a coldsore in my life and i am absolutely going out of my mind that i have herpes..it's causing me some serious mental strife!...If i am still getting these mild symptoms will go back to the doctor but the stress and worry is killing me. Anyone had similar? Or like everyone else do you all think i am worrying over what is a low risk encounter and my syptoms are driving me crazy in my own head and making the dermatitis worse Thanks All Gordy x",Genital Herpes

There is tons of information out there on how HIV is transmitted, and sometimes it can be hard to separate fact from fiction. Here are resources that might be able to answer some of your questions about how HIV is transmitted:  1)    2)    After considering these resources, if you still think that you may have contracted the HIV virus, it's important to speak with a medical professional and to get tested at the appropriate time.

Curious about numbers,"Today I was thinking about my health and was curious to see how my blood sugar levels are. So when I was at the store I brought a device with the test strips. I probably did over 20 different samples. I ate a lot of crackers and pretzels around 130-2pm. I started testing around 5 and finished around 530 just to get a string of numbers and to get the hang of it. I’ve never been diagnosed with diabetes or have symptoms but here are my values.  137  130  203  215  100  110  90  112  129  142  118  145  118  129  145  118  46  142  Those are some of the values I started recording. I know the numbers vary a lot. I’ve been trying to get the right amount on the test strip. Sometimes I would flood it, some times I would almost fill the entire little box up, fill it, and not fill the strip all the way. Later on 3 hours after I ate my dinner I tested my sugar again. I got a reading of 97,112,120, and before I went to bed it got a reading of 116. The next morning I woke up and got a reading after not eating for 12 hours a score of 107. Which is above the recommended fasting range of 80-100. So I tested a few more times ten minutes later and scored 112,108,86,99,94, and 92. A few hours later I ate a frozen dinner for breakfast and had my coffee and two hours after eating I tested again and got another series of numbers. I got many numbers in the low 100s, some in the 110-120 range and two in the 130s. I guess that’s in normal range.  I also was looking at my blood test results from my doctor from the past years.

I'm 26 now. It's been a huge pain in many ways. I've been jogging and running for a long time, I even do 10k and 15k races. I've been doing treatment for years. I don't think it has ever helped my performance, it just makes the whistling go away. The pain in my trachea when I run fast (not necessarily sprinting) is very intense, I can't breathe, my brain gets dizzy, my muscles get numb.

Most of those people play sports or do exercise once a month at most. My doctors never care, they always just tell me to keep taking the meds. Sudden change: About 4 months ago I was training for a race. Everything was fine, the usual sh1t in my cornflakes with the asthma. But my performance was improving little by little (was doing 5k @ 15 k/h). Then one day during training I had a very intense abdominal pain. Unbearable, I had to stop almost immediately. This had never happened before, ever. After that I was never the same, and now it happens every time I train. My performance dropped drastically (now doing 3k @ 14 k/h). This is a huge drop. When I'm done I have the usual painful asthma symptoms plus the intense abdominal pain. I'm so tired of this sh1t. The doctors still don't give a f@ck. I've gone to different pulmonologists and it's all the same. Someone please help.",

Quite by accident we have seen it work as an anti inflammatory in some people. That is, some people who have taken it on a daily basis for digestive disorders, have seen complete reversals in osteoarthritis joint pain and asthma symptoms.  My layman’s explanation for this is that the initial cause of the digestive disorder was also causing enteric inflammation. In reading research reviews on the subject it is possible that enteric inflammation can trigger inflammation elsewhere in the body, such as joints and lungs. Lately I have made it my mission to read all research about the gut microbiome and its possible connection to many health disorders. And there is research showing an association for almost every chronic health problem.  I recognize our testimonials do not constitute scientific results. They are legitimate however and there is other peer reviewed research showing the connections of these ailments to gut microbiome health. Maybe by alleviating a bad bacteria overgrowth and resulting enteric inflammation, Immunade can help some people with asthma and joint pain, which are both caused by Inflammation.",

I just need some insight, because I am getting a bit freaked out! When I was a baby, I had an asthma attack that triggered the fear of not being able to breathe.

I have mild anxiety as well that has not been diagnosed by a medical professional, but I know it exists in my life. I do not take medication for it. Sunday night, I went to sleep and woke up in the middle of the night not being able to breathe, and since then (today is Thursday), I have had a really hard time breathing. This means chest heaviness/tightness, shortness of breath. I feel like the only way I can get a good breath is through a yawn. This freaks me out and triggers that anxiety in me that ""I'm gonna die, I'm going to suffocate"", that I probably had when I was a baby.

Diabetes,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/diabetes/49876/anti-hypogenic-therapies,Anti-Hypogenic Therapies,"Beside of achieving the normal bodyweight for necessary preconditions,  that’s the smart way of therapies, but it means just a handful of older medications can be used with some supplements.  I’m prefer older medications where the long-term side effects known.  Anti-Hypogenic Medications: 1. The old Metformin by possible max. dose of daily up-to 2500mg.  2. 24 hours Basal-Insulin as Toujeo or Tresiba. Here the Insulin which  generally is Hypogenic as Anti-Hypogenic declared, because it can been  fine adjusted in such a manner that Hypos by the Basal-Insulin are  impossible. Attention, for example Levemir is not a Basal-Insulin  as seen at its diagram where it has a huge mountain with huge efficiency falling afterwards. Real Basal-Insulin as the two above have in the diagram a nearly flat horizontal line and because of that they can been adjusted for not causing any Hypos and by  this set at lowest Fasting Glucose of 80 – 90 mg/dl to be OK.  (T1D, Etc. has additionally the Hypogenic Rapid-Insulin for meals.) 3. The old Glucobay to support any therapies at Glucose Upside is a smart supplement, because any regular-sugars at about 90% get not digested anymore just fermented into facal transformed.  At daily 2 – 3x 50mg it has nearly no side effects, where at its daily max. dose up-to 300mg it may creates more poops – LoL  At its description Hypo risk mentioned, but this is to understand when someone got a Hypo and uses regular-sugars it will not function to increase the Glucose and therefore Dextrose (is Glucose)  Powder has to be used, because the Glucobay will allow it to be  digested und will not interfere at Dextrose- or Fructose- Sugars  of Fruits to know.  Resulting it is reducing the Glucose Peaks and also reducing the A1C and provides a better easier overall Glucose control.  (My client’s usually get it daily 2x morning, lounge-time and the once not able to stop junk-foods as Ice-cream, Biscuits, Haribo, Chocolate, Etc. and/or have to reduce weight more  drastically they get it 3x daily by also in the evening.)    4. Potassium as Therapy Supplement essential for good Heart Function and Glucose Metabolism. Daily 800 – 1000mg as for example by Slow-K one day 1 tablet and next day 2 tablets by the following day again 1 tablet for the AV. 900mg daily.  Potassium is not causing any Hypos. Potassium is improving the Glucose Metabolism and by that can reduce the Basal- Insulin up-to about 50% as at my own diabetes the Toujeo.  ( I made 3 Lab tests within 4.2-4.6 mmol/L ( N 3.5 to 5.1 ) Potassium AV. daily 900mg is adequate 2 midsize Bananas.  There is worldwide a Potassium deficiency in the populations.  5. Additionally to improve the blood circulation. Every second day ½ tablet Aspirin and daily 600mg Vitamin-E.  This is what I use successfully for the A1C less 6% Clients, but if you also like to use something from here, you first  would need to speak with your doctor.

While on active duty, I was diagnosed with Exercise Induced Asthma and used an albuterol inhaler for several years which seemed to diminish the effects somewhat. Upon retirement, I received VA benefits commensurate to that disability.  A few years ago, the VA conducted a follow-on test and determined that I no longer had asthma. After several months and visits to the pulmonologist, it was determined that I actually have VCD and not asthma as originally diagnosed. My claim with the VA is that my asthma was originally misdiagnosed and should have been determined to be VCD The VA has now not only denied my claim for asthma, but ruled that my VCD is not service connected. Some of their logic seems faulty and wanted to get some opinions. 1) The VA claims that my asthma issued ""resolved itself"". As I understand asthma, and I am not a medical professional, asthma just doesn't go away. Is that a correct assumption? 2) VCD and asthma symptoms present in very similar ways so they are easy to confuse. As I understand it, asthma medication, such as albuterol, should not have any effect on VCD symptoms. Would albuterol not make breathing easier for someone without asthma, if only marginally?

Asthma,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/asthma/9734/do-you-know-jesus-christ,Do you know Jesus Christ?,"Hi guys. I don't know where to post this, but the Lord has been laying it on my heart for the past few days to tell people about Jesus. This burden is so strong that I have felt sick and very desperate to reach out to others and tell them about Jesus. I asked my Pastor if there were any ministries I could do through my church to serve God, but all he said to me was that if there was anything, he'd let me know. God has been driving me to serve Him so bad that I don't think I can wait much longer for an answer from my Pastor, I am desperate here and I don't think he understands just how urgent it is to witness to the lost. People are dying and going to Hell. That is no laughing matter. So I am going to write a post and witness to the lost on here... Dear person much loved by the Lord, Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners like you and me. Have you ever thought about what happens after you die? I have. It has brought me much anxiety thinking about it, because I know that this life does not last forever and one day, we all will die. A lot of people today do not think about where they will spend eternity, and this thinking is a big mistake. But what happens after death? The Bible is the only book that can tell us what happens to us after we die. God Himself wrote this great book; it is probably the most important book that was ever written. Do you mind if I quote some Scriptures? Some people get offended when I quote the Bible, but I never do. Do you know why? Because I am a Christian and I believe that Jesus is my Saviour. The Bible says so. And with that being said, I will give you some Bible verses to help you and educate you. So what happens after we die? The Bible teaches that man is a tripart being composed of spirit, soul, and a fleshly body. At death, our souls separate from our body and goes back to God to be judged by Him. God will judge everything we do in the body, whether good or bad. But here is the bad news. You see, nobody is truly a good person. You see, only God is truly good. Have you ever told a lie? Have you ever stolen anything? Have you ever hated anyone? If you have, then you have sinned. Killing others is also a sin, and yet you hear every day on the news that someone has murdered somebody else. Why? Because mankind are sinners and on their way to a burning Hell. Rom 3:23 : For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Now that you know that no one is good in God's eyes, how do we then become good? How do we become vindicated before God? The Bible teaches that we need to have Jesus' righteousness but the only way to do that is to come to Him by faith: Rom 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Rom 10:10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. So you see that you need to believe in your heart that God raised up Jesus from the dead, and you also need to confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is the Lord. If you die without Christ, you will spend eternity in Hell. In our modern world today, people think that Hell is a place of never-ending parties and good times. They think that all of their friends will be there. But that is far from the truth. You would think that these people have never read the Bible, or that they have never taken it seriously. The Bible teaches that Hell is a place of never-ending fire and torment, and my dear friend, that is not very much fun (this truth has scared a lot of people). It is a place of tears and no hope. It is darkness and loneliness. You won't be able to see anyone at all. It is eternal separation from God Himself. Since God is the Source of Joy and Happiness, that means that everything apart from Him is tears, sorrow, and no happiness. And that does not sound like very much fun at all, doesn't it? So my dear friend, for your own eternal safety, I pray that you will accept Jesus Christ into your heart today, and make Him Lord over your life. If you have done this, you need to find a Bible-believing church where you can grow in God's Word. And you also need to find out what God wants you to do with your life, so that you may serve Him.

I smoked for the past 4 years, up to this day without any health problems. After this winter, which was marked by 2 or 3 colds(very unusual for me to get a cold more than once a year), I found myself coughing up tonsil stones. This spring, I started noticing pain in my chest(not localised in one place) while bending over and breathing deeply(sometimes). Another thing that made me question my health is that my smoker's cough changed into what I can describe only as a vibrating cough( vibration comes from the lungs or trachea?) that sometimes brings up some kind of white/translucent tissue that looks like the skin inside my mouth. I wouldn't be so concerned if those pieces of skin weren't striking my palate that hard(i drew the conclusion that they come from somewhere down my throat?). I don't know if I can blame any of this on allergies, but I think I should mention that they've hit me with full force this season. Any hope for a diagnosis?",Diagnosis

It is a long description but I think it was important to include.  I have tried to make it as readable as possible.  My father who is 70 years old has been experiencing continuous hiccups for a year now.  This is obviously very painful as he is unable to eat or even sleep properly. After testing countless home remedies, we got him checked by medical experts about 6 months ago.  Almost all of them informed us it is due to prolonged stress, which might be true due to certain events in our lives. ********** BACKGROUND INFO ********** Age = 70 years. Ethnicity = South Asian. He has had high blood pressure and high cholesterol for more than 25 years, has been gout patient too for that amount of time. He has been obese as well for 25+ years, current weight = 245 lb, height = almost 6 feet. He also had type 2 diabetes probably for 15+ years. He can barely walk and is not active at all, mostly due to back and joint pains. He has avoided almost all meat products for 10+ years, but I think he gained weight due to more consumption of carbohydrates, specifically white flour and rice. No smoking/drinking or recreational drugs habits thankfully. He has also been experiencing cough and weakness and loss of appetite for the last 20 days or so. None of the doctors were 100% sure about the solution and prescribed the following tests and medications:  ********** TESTS DONE ********** All information is within 3 months range. -Uric Acid = 7 [normal] -All Cholesterols Total/HDL/LDL within range -Triglycerides 10-20% above normal range -ALT normal -Blood sugar controlled by 2 medicines, Glucophage and Glucobay -His ultrasound was i think normal too. -In a very recent test, it was shown his heart walls have become thick due to prolonged stress and cholesterol.  ********** DOCTORS CURRENT CONSENSUS ********** Out of the 5 doctors consulted, 2 are Cardiologists, 2 General Practitioner and a very recent one is Neurologist. Should I also consult Gastroenterologist? -Doctors ruled out existence of tumors or cancers etc based on ultrasound and long history of hiccups. Few doctors also suggested it might be GERD or acid reflux but he does not have all the symptoms. ********** ANY OTHER TESTS NEEDED? ********** I wonder now why no doctor asked to check his ""cortisol"" range? Is it not important to test to measure stress? Any other important factors to test for his stress levels? Is ENDOSCOPY really needed? No doctor so far suggested it but after researching online it seems very important? **********RECENT MEDICATIONS FOR HICCUPS********** Medications for hiccups he has been using regularly since the past 3-4 months -Motilium tablet [4 months][1+1+1 before each meal] -Nexum capsule [3 months][1+0+1 before each meal] -Gaviscon syrup [3 months] [1+0+1, 1 tbsp after each meal]  -Motival tablet [1 month][1, in the night] for stress/anxiety -RIVOTRIL for stress management prescribed by a neurologist for 3 weeks. ******OTHER DAILY LONGTERM MEDICATIONS HE TAKES REGULARLY******* These are additional medications he has to take daily for heart, blood pressure, sugar, uric acid and pain killers etc. -COEZIDAY 100mg 1x  -CAPOTIN 50mg 2x [0.25+0.25mg] -GLUCOPHANGE 500mg 1x -GLUCOBAY 50mg 1x -DISPIRIN 300mg 1x -ZYLORIC 100mg [URIC ACID] **********THE ONLY TEMPORARY REMEDY THAT WORKS********** A very temporary cure [30 minutes to 1 hour] is drinking any cola [higher the carbonation, better] while standing and bending low. Drinking warm water helps a little bit as well. Please tell me what can we do about it? This has been very painful not only to the patient but for all family members as well. I can of course provide more info if needed.  Any help will be highly appreciated. Thank you very much again.","Insulin , Treatments , Type 2 Diabetes"

The problems also artificially created by medications registered for Type 1 or Type 2 where objectively some Type 1 medication has also advantages for Type 2 and some Type 2 medications have also advantages for Type 1. It needs to speak with the doctors  about to improve the therapies.  There is now some attempt to create 5 therapy groups as seen here:   (18)30051-2/fulltext?elsca1=tlpr      For example all Type 1 or Type 2 or LADA, etc. some more, should  have Basal-Insulin if useful with Metformin in different doses to adjust  to the lowest fasting Glucose of 80-90mg/dl.  Type 1 and LADA Basal-Insulin with SR Metformin 500mg every 12 hours. Type 2 possibly Basal-Insulin with SR Metformin 1000mg every 12 hours.  (Injecting Insulin can be pain free if well done as I do it daily. Additionally at Type 1 the Rapid-Insulin to meals and at Type 2 this possibly not. As Basal-Insulin I’m prefer the Toujeo because that can daily been adjusted to observe at following 3-4 days, where for example the  Tresiba need 4 days to be adjusted for afterwards to observe at following 3-4 days. The Tresiba creates a perfect straight line, where the Toujeo still has a very flat curve with a Tmax but this I like and for that reason I’m injecting it in the morning to have at evening a little more effect where I have at evening a little higher mg/dl, for people in the morning with a little higher to inject at evening.)  Metformin is also reducing heart failure risks. At my son with Type 1 and myself I could see the Metformin advantages combined with the Basal-Insulin, because the Liver-Glucose is much better under control and this provides a much easier Glucose managing. There has been only one problem, because we both underweight cloud not lose more weight and daily every 12 hours 500mg SR Metformin is monthly  reducing about 1-2 lbs and therefore we did need to stop that.  About the Heart and Blood Pressure it needs Potassium supplementing. There is a worldwide Potassium deficiency in the populations and the Heart cannot really function without the right amount of Potassium.  This especially by people using some reduced diets or low-carb diet.  From my own experience I can tell, by not having any micro-macro- vascular problems resulting neuropathic symptoms and not using diets, just normal homemade food, after over 50 years of SIS 110-120 and  Potassium more at normal-minimum, to my surprise got SIS 150-160 by myself a little underweight and the feet’s started to get swollen.  Since about 3 months now I’m supplementing the Potassium by daily 1 Slow-K Tablet every 12 hours and I got back my SIS 110-120 and swollen feet’s disappeared and the Basal-Insulin from daily 18-20 Units I could reduce to only 6 Units with the same fasting Glucose 80-90mg/dl and the Rapid-Insulin at meals could also reduce to less than half.  At Potassium is mentioned, also to regulate the Glucose Metabolism!  I can imagine that Potassium at Type 2 can also do a good job.  If there are diabetes related other disorders, it naturally need additional medical considerations or medications.

Diabetes,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/diabetes/2155/what-do-you-do-to-fight-diabetes,"What Do You Do To ""Fight"" Diabetes?","In order to beat Type 2 Diabetes, you have to ""fight"" to improve your health. What stands in the way of most people, newly diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes, is themselves. They refuse to look for simple ways to make improvements in their health. They think, ""I'll just let my doctor tell me what to do."" There's two problems with this line of thinking: 1. They don't follow anyone's advice, let alone, their doctor's, and 2. Their doctor only see's them for 15 minutes every 6-12 months (What about the other 262, 775 minutes?). It's the cumulative healing power of the ""little things"" one performs during the course of each day that's the real ""doctor"" in the fight against T2D (and every other lifestyle disease). Here's a few examples of some small lifestyle practices that can make a big impact on this disease... 1. Upon waking in the AM, drink as much water as you possibly can. I drink 3/4 of a liter, workout for one hour, drink 1/4 of liter of water, then, drink a cup of coffee, no sugar. If properly hydrated, you should pee all of this out in about 90-120 minutes. If not, you ain't ""properly hydrated"" (dehydration is at the core of most health issues, today). 2. I thoroughly rinse my mouth out with warm water after eating. This limits bacterial growth in the mouth that destroys the enamel on teeth and can contribute to inflammation in the gut. 3. Emotional wellness is good for the body. Maintaining a positive attitude and performing ""good deed(s)"" throughout the day places your mind (and body) in a good place.  4. Scrub your skin when showering to exfoliate and open up skin pores. This encourages new skin growth, fights aging wrinkled skin.  Remember: Think ""little things"".",

I am just done in, generally, and off I go to the ER. Invariably I am admitted because the neb treatments and mega doses of intravenous steroids given in the ER don't open my airways enough and my wheezing and overall illness continues. On average I spend 3 days in the hospital getting these treatments. I thought everyone with asthma went through this, but I came to understand that most asthmatics just go to the ER occasionally and they get fixed up and go home the same day. I don't know why my symptoms are so stubborn. The only good news is my attacks are much less frequent since giving away one of my cats. I was horribly allergic to her, but not particularly allergic to my older cat! But the real bugaboo is catching a cold. That's a guaranteed hospital stay, for me.

The last two of the five days, when I've sort of forced air out of my mouth, you hear a little rumbling, but not on a normal, shallower exhalation. I am a non-smoker adult male and live a fairly active lifestyle.  The doctor told me that the little rumbling which sounded to me like phlegm suggests that I have ASTHMA, that my bronchial tubes had become ""overstressed"", and the sound was due to the tubes having become swollen and touching each other on the sides, rather than a phlegm buildup. I was also diagnosed with a ""minor upper respiratory infection"".  Here are my concerns: (1) I am under the impression that you need to have at least a little bit more real evidence to diagnose someone with asthma, which as far as I was aware is a chronic disease and to diagnose it requires lung tests, etc. Is this correct? (2) The doctor attempted to give me a package of BREO Ellipta which she recommended I take once a day and attempted to prescribe me a ZPak along with it. I diligently read up on this BREO Ellipta and found that this should apparently NEVER be prescribed for someone other than someone who either has asthma unmanageable with less potent medications or who has COPD, and that to prescribe a ZPak / azithromycin along with BREO is definitely contraindicated. Furthermore, I've found no support in favor of diagnosing ASTHMA, a chronic disease, in any way resembling what this Doctor did. Everything I've read has convinced me there is no way in hell this should ever have been provided to me and, unless I am gravely mistaken here, I am very glad I did not merely trust this Doctor and begin taking this medication. Infact, after easing up on trying to cough everything out my cough has significantly diminished after 6-8 hours.

I am 52 years old that had bad asthma when I was a child. I seemed I outgrow from my 20 to mid 30's. In my mid 30's I started getting frequent sinus infections. I have had 3 sinus surgeries and take advair, singulair, nasonex, astepro daily along with other medications. Also, in my mid 30's I started getting severe IBS. After many, many tests I eventually found a ""cure"" for that on the internet. The 'cure' is taking digestive enzymes after every meal.  I have been on more antibiotic than I can count and any cold or flu always turns into sinus infection and bronchitis combination. My question... has anyone experience the below symptoms and if so what did they do to improve and prevent the same scenario moving forward? -a cold or flu turns into fever for 5 plus days. -cold or flu always turns into sinus infection and bronchitis which always required prednisone and long term antibiotics which get less effective and 80% of the time don't work. -severe coughing which requires quadrupling asthma medication.

It started in high school, while I was running cross country. My first semester I never had difficulty breathing, but the next semester I noticed my breathing was holding me back. Gradually my times tapered off as the years progressed. After races it's took me many more minutes that my friends to regain my breath. I asked my doctor for an invalid but it didn't make running any easier. One time I broke my mile time by 2 minutes effortlessly but after the race started coughing up mucus. Another time, I was racing my brother, who was 10. I beat him at sprints, but he won when we raced a lap around the track. He asked me if I had really been trying. It was clear to me then that I was fighting against something that he wasn't, and it only affected me in longer races that required efficient, constant breathing. I learned not to fight it and to just slow down if it happened. But the Shortness of breath was only an issue during exercise. I stopped running competitively in college, and in my final year of college I noticed Shortness of breath while not exercising. Now after graduating, I have episodes where my Shortness of breath is making me feel like I can't get enough air, even when I'm sitting or lying down. So now it's gotten to the point where I can't ignore it like I did before. The hardest part is expelling air- it feels like I can't breathe out to make room for more air. Pressing something against my back offers some relief. So what do you think? Is this asthma?",

Severe, chronic symptoms improved: • Asthma and respiratory issues. • Nasal congestion. • Constipation. • Headaches. • Muscle cramping, weakness and pain. • Insomnia. • Palpitations.

I have taken the following Oraquick tests on the following dates:  12/7 - Negative 12/26 - Negative 01/08 - Negative 01/10 - Negative 01/15 - Negative 01/17 - Negative I also went to CityMd yesterday (01/17) and took a rapid finger prick test called Chembio HIV 1/2 Stat Pack Assay and the result was negative as well.  My last encounters since the last 2 tests range from 60-74 days. Can anyone give me any feedback on whether or not my results are accurate using the testing methods I’ve used so far. I really appreciate the feedback. Thank you ahead of time.","Possible Exposure , Symptoms , Home Testing Kits"

She served me about 1 hour and 20 minutes. 1. She rimmed me about 30 seconds then I told her to stop, I know that oral-anal sex is considered very low risk, but the thing is earlier in the day, I had noticed some specks of blood on the toilet paper I had used after washing my anus after I used the toilet. Does this increase the risk of infection? And because I don't know the oral health status of the woman, if she had bleeding gums, will this increase the chance of infection considering there is at least one cut on my anus according to the specks of blood on the toilet paper? I don't know if she insert her lips or tongue into my anus(I can't remember very clear), will this behavior increase the risk? 2. She gave me a fellatio about 30 seconds then I told her to stop(I didn't ejaculate in her mouth). According to other posts in the forum, it seems that the risk of receiving oral sex is also considered a very low risk behavior, but on the CDC website, it says that bleeding gums or other open cuts and sores in the mouth can increase risk of infection. Is this a risky behavior? 3. We didn't have any vaginal or anal intercourse, she gave me a handjob at last, I was thinking if it is possible to catch HIV virus because there is semen from a previous customer on her hand. 4. At the end of her service, I kissed her about 10 seconds, it was an open mouth kiss but not deep. But I didn't have a very good oral health status at that time, after about 30 minutes when I was brushing me teeth, I saw my gums are bleeding, I won't say that it is very serious to confuse you, but I did see my gum is bleeding and there is blood in my mouth. Will this increase the chance of infection? If she also had bleeding gums when we are kissing, will this increase the risk? 5. If she has other STIs, will this increase risk?

I decided to take a trip to Japan and everything was great sightseeing and eating and eating more. Last night of the trip before flying back home, I ended up going to a love hotel with an escort. It was one of the escorts specializing in anal. I used one of those 0.001mm condoms they sold in Japan but broke during sex. I didn't notice until after I realized I ejaculated in her and pulled out (Probably lasted about 10 min broken). The agency offered bareback anal but I did not select that but the given the fact that the condom was completely broken and I did not notice for 10 minutes (might as well be unprotected sex at that point with most of the penis exposed) and even though Japan has a very low HIV rate, I am still worried I might've been infected. I shaved the morning of that day which also did not help this situation. It's been about 2 weeks since that happened and I am so paranoid about if I am infected with HIV. I read that there is a higher risk of getting infected through anal. I looked up the symptoms and do not have any flu like symptoms, rashes, vomiting, etc. The closest flu-like symptom that occurred was recent when I felt slightly dizzy and a slightly hot head for an hour but went away after. I figured this may have to do with the stress and sleeping 5 hours a day due to the anxiety and working full-time on top of that. The part that scares me is that the joint on my both thumbs started to hurt a little bit when I pressed somewhat on it. I read that joint pain is also one of the earlier symptoms. No neck joint pain or thigh area pain as of now. I did have skin peeling on my arm and face but that was due to getting sunburned and looking like a tomato. I did notice that I have slightly dry and flaky skin near my elbows but I'm not sure if that has to do with the sunburn, diet, stress, or worst case HIV. I have seen a few pinkish dots on my arm and stomach area but I think that's more towards a pimple since I always had skin problems on my chest and back (nowhere near the redness and density of a typical rash).  I am considering testing with the HIV RNA test which I heard searches for the actual virus and not the antibodies and allows the test to be accurate during the window period. Is this the way I should go or should I wait a week and test with the 4th generation test? I'm not sure which one is better. Also, is there a high chance I did get infected or is my paranoia psychologically making it a lot worse than it seems?","Possible Exposure , Symptoms , Treatment , Diagnosis"

HIV/AIDS,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/hiv-aids/37048/condom-almost-slipped-off-changed-condoms-twice,Condom almost slipped off. Changed condoms twice.,"About 4 months ago, I had sex with a commercial escort. Based on her face and appearance, it looked like she could be a drug user, not sure whether its intravenous or not though. She was a Caucasian female. Out of curiosity, I asked if she allowed unprotected sex, and she said no. Then later she said, “I mean, I’m ok with no condom as long as you don’t cum inside me.” That raised some red flags. Then she said, “But I’m clean.” Then I asked when she was last tested. She replied, “I get tested every 3 months. That’s my life!” Naturally, I know better than to trust some stranger so I didn’t believe her. We started off by doing some deep french kissing, lots of tongue too for about a few minutes. I also licked her nipples with my tongue. Then we moved on to her giving me unprotected oral sex. Before she started, she asked me if I was clean. I said yes. Then she started giving me a blowjob (fellatio). Her tongue swirled around my penis head. The we moved on to protected vaginal sex. First position was cowgirl and the motion got progressively vigorous. Then we changed position to doggystyle. After a while, suddenly the condom nearly slipped out as I thrust inward, covering only a little more below my penis head, but exposing more than half of my penis shaft. My tip was slightly inside her vagina when I immediately froze once I saw it slip. I then used my hand to pull off the condom, grabbing the furthest end that was near the penis head. Then I went to go grab another condom. I then handed it to her and she tore open the wrapper and put in on my penis. But my penis was moderately flaccid at that point when she put it on and it was loose. The size of this condom might have also been too large for me. So I told her to suck on it with the condom on to get it hard again. After sucking it, it got hard again. Then we continue on to missionary position. During the intercourse she rubbed a little area above her vagina with her two fingers during the intercourse. After a few minutes my penis went flaccid or soft again, so I pulled it out with the condom fully intact but loose. I pulled it out with my hand grabbing the base. And went to grab a third condom, gave it to her and she put it on and sucked on it again to get it hard. Then i went back to missionary. It was getting soft again so I used two fingers and pinch both sides of my penis at the base of the shaft to guide it in straight to her vagina as I thrust inward. I was trying to finish with an ejaculation but I couldn’t. As I was pulling out my flaccid penis, the loose condom slipped out and stayed stuck in her vagina. I couldn’t remember if it was me or her that took out the condom though. Then we were done. The day after, I was pondering whether I was at risk of exposure. 3 days later, I started having muscle twitches in various parts of my body such as thighs, legs, and arms. I also started to have sharp stabbing pains coming and going all over different parts of my body. My inner ear lobes were itching. I also had a few joint pain instances particularly on my fingers. I also had some muscle aches and tension, mostly on my right forearm. Roughly around 3 weeks after that suspected exposure an itchy mosquito bite-like bump appeared on my left forearm, but went away after a few hours. Could possibly be hives. A few weeks later another one appeared on my left calf. Then again on my left forearm in the same exact spot a week or so later. At around 3 weeks a little pink blotch appeared on one of my right knuckles and another one on my face to the right of my nose at over 3 months post incident. I also had a sharp pain on the left side of my head that lasted for 30 minutes at over 3 months post incident. Also at that time I woke up from bed one night with a little sweat around my neck and collar. Maybe it was a hot flash and not an actual night sweat otherwise my whole pillow would’ve been drenched. This happened at over 3 months post incident. Hypothetically, if the woman was HIV positive, was there a possible risk of exposure based on any of the actions discussed above? Is it somewhat possible that I may have mishandled the switching of new condoms and her vaginal fluid might have crept inward towards my urethra underneath the condom? Maybe when condom was loose? When she did fellatio on the condom trying to harden me? Or maybe during the intercourse motion? Maybe her saliva on my penis from the blowjob caused the condom to slip out. I know that kissing an oral sex had negligible risk. I wasn’t sure if she had any sores, cuts, or bleeding gums in her mouth. Now I regret for not checking beforehand. I am absolutely terrified. I can’t sleep well. I can’t focus on my everyday tasks. My anxiety is off the charts. My twitching, stabbing pains, and muscle aches hasn’t went away. I’m not exactly sure what’s causing these symptoms. Could it be a possible infection, other STDs/STIs, my anxiety, or something else? It’s been over 4 months and I know I could’ve tested at 3 months but I held it off because I wasn’t psychologically ready to take it. I’m so afraid. Sorry for the lengthy question, but I thought it was necessary to be specific. I need some clarity, and hopefully a peace of mind when I go get tested.

A few days later I got really sick and questioned her about her hiv status but she ensured me I’m fine. I let it go (big mistake) over the next two years I’ve experienced muiltple symtoms. Fatigue, mucle aches, joint pain (mainly knees) diarrhea(on and off), balantis, white tongue( I do smoke), stomach pains, anal itching, ringworm like rashes, consistent dry cough( not sure if it’s smoking and I’ve had bronchntis since childhood), red spots on scalp (itchy at times and lots of dandruff). No fevers or swollen lymph nodes! So after the initial sickness I felt okay but didn’t really feel 100% the last two years. I’ve had a run in with gonorrhrea January 2018. After my run in with gonorrhea I chalked that up as why I haven’t felt the best but after getting treatment I didn’t really feel a any different. Recently I’ve been feeling the worst then I’ve ever been and I’m concerned if I did contract hiv two years ago and me being a smoker my immune system is compromised already and maybe I have aids.

I’ve order the insti antibody and antigen test. Being that it’s been almost two years I feel maybe I received a false negative with Oraquick Test because of lack of antibodies. What are my chances going into this combo antibody + antigen test and receiving a negative result also. Was my Oraquick Test conclusive? I also just broke out with a rash under my right armpit. Small red slightly raised bumps, some contains fluids others are peeling dead skin. It hurts/ burns when I itch. Please help me! Is the a possibility I could still be hiv +?

If your answer is yes, then here is some food for your thought. The mind is said to be very powerful, when one focuses and channels one's energy the result is said to be powerful enough to move a mountain. Let's think of something much much smaller. Can we change a cell? Just one cell in our body? What if we gather a group of people diagnosed with HIV from different countries and hypnotize them to think they can bring forth a change in their body which will be able to destroy the virus. So as to give them the idea, that they have a chance to have an alteration in their genetic makeup, (just like what happens naturally). As that thought keeps working in their minds, maybe a change will occur, in 1 million if at least 5 people develop a cure, by studying them, we should be able to make the cure for everyone, suffering. Basically we're letting evolution give the answer and helping it by channeling people's minds. There are many psychiatrists around the world who are capable of hypnotizing patients in need. Hypnotherapy has been used to change behavior and feelings. So one would ask, why HIV? Not only is it due to the fact that the virus's illusive and changing nature has baffled scientists for years but also that it is the perfect disease for this study. It's easy to find at least 1 million people suffering from this illness who would be most willing to try out an approach like hypnotism in the hope that they themselves might be cured. Depending on the availability of hypnotists the patients can be hypnotized in centers around the world 10-20 per week in each center. From the moment of enrolment they should be followed up for at least 5 years.  The survivors will hold the key. A critic would argue saying whether this can be the cure for any disease, any cancer? Unfortunately for most other diseases we cannot find such a vast population of affected individuals. Evolution + hypnotism = a possible cure.",Treatment

I waited 3 years feeling sick or making myself feel sick. I told someone and they got me to go to doctors and I got a hiv swab test at 19. 3 years later after that stuff.

My life was never athletic and I sat at a computer most of the day. Recently (just starting college) I'll attend the gym 3-4 times a week and do standard weight training (focus a different body part each day) with nothing super intensive. I'm pretty much primarily focusing on upper body. It seems, however, right after I come home I'm crazy insulin sensitive. There will be periods where I'll give half the recommended amount of insulin and I'll still drop from 300 to 60 (if my blood sugar for some reason got high right afterwards). I feel very tired right afterwards (like a physical tired, not necessarily sleepy) and I get very anxious. The few days after I go to the gym I'll still feel this effect where insulin is much more sensitive. I'm getting a little annoyed/scared because I'll sometimes take my blood sugar at 9:00 PM (after going to the gym around 3:00 PM) and I'll be 250, I give a shot, then it'll drop really quickly/too much and I have to have snacks periodically to get it go to back up. Is this common? I know that working out will obviously make you drop directly afterwards but are there ever cases where it will make you THIS insulin sensitive? I've only been working out for maybe ~2 months. My diet is really sparse recently which I feel may be a leading factor in this. I'll wake up, grab a granola bar or something, then wait until later in the day to eat a full meal. Please let me know if you need any other information!

The immunological basis explained ...,"Technical version: Topical chicken protein to treat type 1 diabetes? The immunological basis explained ...     Simplified version: Strange idea? May not be for people familiar with food allergy treatment. Peanut protein patch applied to HEALTHY skin is a treatment for peanut allergy. One of the ways peanut protein applied to skin works, is the generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) specific to peanut. Tregs regulate/moderate the immune system's reaction to peanut exposure. One of the causes for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a reduction in the number of Tregs in the pancreas. This allows CD8+ T cells to attack the islet cells, unrestrained, causing T1D.   Why chicken soup? As explained in the articles below, chicken protein is the most likely source of the proteins that train the CD8+ T cells to attack the islet cells. We need chicken protein specific Tregs to restrain them.           The potential solution is to create chicken protein specific Tregs by topical chicken soup.   Why topical and not drinking/eating chicken soup? Tregs are trained to home to a part of the body. Eating/drinking chicken soup generates Tregs that home to the gut. Topical chicken soup generates Tregs that home to the skin. As described in the articles above, the CD8+ T cells that attack islet cells are trained to home to the skin. But it turns out the pancreas attract these cells by producing the same chemical attractant as the skin. Therefore skin homing Tregs produced by topical chicken soup will also home to the pancreas just like the CD8+ T cells.   Going by the peanut patch experience, it could take up to a year to see the effect ... if it works. IMPORTANT: Never apply food proteins to damaged skin, only to HEALTHY skin.","Treatments , Type 1 Diabetes"

Immediately literally seconds after she used my phone I went and got a sanitize wipe and cleaned my phone and washed my hands. I never touch her but I'm wondering if maybe her acne was bleeding or just the germs from her acne on my phone screen could transmit a disease to me. I have a small cut at the bottom of my nail near the cuticle from a loose piece of skin that I pulled due to not having a nail clipper and the skin was bothering me but could the short amount of time that I got my phone back from her if i have somehow touched my broken skin to my phone screen and gotten her blood from her acne or germs in my cut have infected me if she were to have something? I didn't notice her bleeding anywhere and when she handed me the phone back I only used 2 fingers to grab it cause I was thinking to myself shes probably not clean. I don't think I could've touched my cut to my phone since its on my thumb but I used that thumb and my pointer finger to hold the phone but if I did could that be a way to infect me?

As the disease has progressed from pills to injections, I have been unable to get a handle on diabetic ""Dawn Syndrome"". I have read and followed every article suggestion and book reviews on the subject but my sugar count was consistently over 200 when rising in the morning. At bedtime around 10:30PM, my sugar would be between 110 and 125. My last food intake was between 7:00 and 7:30 PM. Then I make a mixture of Gin (Beefeater) and yellow raisins. I took an empty sauce jar and filled it half-way with the yellow raisins. I covered the raisins with Gin and left a 2 inch surplus of Gin on the top of the raisins. I closed the jar and let it marinate for 7 days on my kitchen counter. After most of the Gin was absorbed by the raisins, I placed the covered jar in the refrigerator. (This process is usually recommended for people with Arthritis). After I took my diabetic medicine at bedtime, I also took nine (9) raisins. When I woke, my sugar reading were normal between 103 and 128. The phenomenon that has occurred still remains. I do not know why but the results obtained through this method continue. I also take the raisins before each meal and I have reduced my Insulin injection amount by 50 %.

Six months ago my primary care Dr moved away so I was assigned a new doctor . My original Dr never done an EMG on me so my new Dr sent me to the neurologist so she could know for sure what's wrong with me. Since 2014 I've been dealing with every pain associated with nuerapathy its gotten worse to the point wear both of my feet are nearly 100% numb on the bottom soles and my toes are going completely numb as well. I'm having a hard time walking ,losing balance, body weakness, arms going numb, and elecrtic shocks in hands and arms,etc.. I've been on amatripiline, venaflaxine, gabepaten, lyrica, and cymbalta.

Every diabetic has heard their doctor say these words. They say it at the end of every appointment. They say it, like it's as easy as, ""Don't leave the house without your cell phone"", or, ""Don't forget to brush your teeth twice a day"". But, anybody can brush their teeth twice a day. Very few, though, can ""eat more fruits and vegetables"". Why? Because, 1. Process foods are easy. Hand over the money, toss it in the microwave. You'll be eating in less than a few minutes. 2. Process foods are tasty. It's loaded with sugar and salt, the most subliminally addictive ""legal"" compounds in the world. Do you think manufacturers don't know this?  3. Process foods don't spoil. No need to throw away processed food because it's got ""preservatives"" (some people actually think this is a ""good"" thing!).  4. Process foods are cheap. Pancake mix? Cheap!. Crackers? Cheap! White bread? Cheap! Tortillas? Cheap! Pasta? What's cheaper than pasta?  How easy do you think it is to ""Eat More Fruits and Vegetables"" when most are not nearly as easy, tasty, can spoil in hours instead of months, and expensive (because it's got to ""cooked"" within a recipe that contains 9 other ingredients)? But, the biggest obstacle to ""E.M.F.V.""?  You have to actually perform WORK. Generally speaking, when you ""E.M.F.V."", you have to shop, prepare, cook and clean up after each meal. In other words, it's a lot of work!  A member said to me the other day, ""the reality is, most diabetics are just not capable of reversing Type 2 Diabetes..."" The sad truth is, he's right. People are ""too busy"". They have too many ""obligations"". They have too many ""mouths to feed"" and ""bills to pay"". They have too many trips to make and events to plan. They have to go back to school. They have to look for work. They have to buy a new car. They have to take care of their mom. They have to take their dog to the vet. Their kid was arrested for D.U.I.. They got arrested for D.U.I...yada, yada, yada. How can you eat more fruits and vegetables and still have time to live your life?  So, when somebody posts a question about diabetes ""diets"" and ""diabetes friendly foods"" to recommend, just remember ""E.M.F.V."". Unless you live in a cave, everybody, by now, has heard about the absolute critical importance ""Eat More Fruits and Vegetables"" has in treating Type 2 Diabetes. They already know what to eat. That's not the problem. What they're really asking is, what real foods can I eat that don't require any work, whatsoever, and are, of course, easy, tasty, fast and cheap?  Sadly, if all fruits and vegetables were easy, tasty, fast and cheap, there would be no disease in the world. If you want to be free of Type 2 Diabetes, you have to pay the price.",

I'm scared to tell my family?,"Hello. I'm a 16 year old female and the last couple of days I haven't been feeling the best. However, I noticed that right before I started to feel this way I became particularly afraid of developing diabetes. It started off with slight numbness in my feet. At first I assumed it was only a placebo effect causing the sudden numbness. And then the numbness disappeared and it turned into a weird feeling in my calf, not a pins and needles sensation but just a strange feeling. Shortly after, I noticed that I started to feel generally unwell, like I had a bad cold. I noticed that I would get chills at random times. However, right before all of these symptoms started I just felt generally less hungry and I wasn't eating much, maybe about one meal a day. At first I assumed that perhaps it was caused by me not eating much. Then I noticed that I felt an increased need to urinate. I found that I felt the increased need the most when I was worrying about diabetes. However whenever I urinated only a little would come out and it usually had a strong scent of ammonia. Also I'll occasionally get these weird on and off feelings of being very drowsy. I noticed they usually occurred around 9 pm until usually midnight. I found it strange that eating usually made the fatigue go away temporarily. I would assume that eating would usually make it worst so this adds onto my doubts. The weird leg sensation has also been on and off as well and it usually goes away temporarily while I'm being physically active. If I now think about it, this illness has been kinda on and off. One minute I'll feel almost completely healthy then next minute I feel as if I didn't sleep at all the previous night. Also, I checked my weight and I haven't gain nor lost any at all. Also I've been feeling feverish so I assume it might be an infection that mimics the symptoms of diabetes. I've been feeling this way for about 4 days now. Right before this I felt perfectly healthy.  I'm from a low income family so I kinda grew up eating crap and I still kinda do. I also usually do ingest a large amount of sugar and I have a family history of diabetes so I know I'm at a pretty high risk. I'm scared to tell my family because I don't want to burden them financially, and to be honest I'm terrified of needles! Before this, I've always been very healthy despite my eating habits and I've barely been ill in my entire life. I'm just kinda scared to accept the fact that I'm no longer healthy and that I'll probably never be able to eat anything sugary ever again. I've googled diabetic diets and it just seems so limited. I'm so angry at myself and I wish I could go back and change my habits. Does anyone have some advice? I'm so worried and scared. Not to mention my birthday is less than a month away and I want to be able to eat birthday sweets. And in case you're wondering, I'm at a pretty healthy weight and I'm not fat or obese.",Symptoms

Diabetes,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/diabetes/10099/type-2-is-the-most-common-form-of-diabetes,Type 2 is the most common form of diabetes,"Type 2 is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for more than 90% of all cases of diabetes. The number of adults diagnosed with diabetes in the United States has risen significantly over the past 30 years, from 5.5 million, almost doubling to $ 21.3 million in 1980 Type 2 diabetes has been known as adult onset diabetes and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), but the disease can occur at any age and increasingly includes childhood. What is type 2 diabetes? Type 2 diabetes is most common in adulthood and occurs in overweight and physically inactive people. Unlike the currently unavoidable type 1 diabetes, many of the risk factors for type 2 diabetes can be modified. Therefore, for many people, this can be prevented. The International Diabetes Foundation highlights four symptoms that indicate the need for a diabetes test: Frequent urination lose weight Lack of energy Excessive thirsty For more information, visit the Knowledge Center article on symptoms or diagnoses. Type 2 diabetes causes Insulin resistance is usually a precursor to type 2 diabetes - glucose enters cells that require more insulin than usual insulin. Insulin resistance in the liver leads to more glucose production, whereas the resistance of the peripheral tissue means that glucose uptake is impaired. Obese male abdomen. Obesity can lead to insulin resistance - usually a precursor to the development of type 2 diabetes. Damage will stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin, but the final pancreas can not be enough to prevent blood sugar levels rise too high. Genetics plays an important role in type 2 diabetes - the relatives of people with the disease are at a high risk, especially among the American Indians, Hispanic and Asian populations. Obesity and weight gain are important factors that lead to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, which play an important role in genetics, eating habits, exercise and lifestyle. The effect of body fat on insulin and glucose metabolism is hormonal. Once the type 2 diabetes is identified, health care providers can help patients receive education and monitoring programs, including how to detect signs of hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and other complications of diabetes. As with other forms of diabetes, nutrition and physical activity and exercise are important factors in lifestyle management.

Diabetes,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/diabetes/8905/may-i-suggest-this-to-reverse-your-diabetes-fasting,May I Suggest This To Reverse Your Diabetes:  Fasting,"How many supplements have you read about that supposedly ""cures"" diabetes? How many diets? How are those drugs your doctor's prescribed for your diabetes; How's that working for you? Here's my suggestion that I know will work: Fasting Why does it work? Because, when you stop eating, your blood sugar levels not only decrease, your INSULIN levels decrease, too. So, why is that such a big deal? Because, insulin is the ""Fat Storage Hormone"". Insulin clears the bloodstream of blood sugar and places it in the liver (glycogen) and any excess glucose, in lipid cells as fat.  The reason why bariatric surgery reverses Type 2 Diabetes well BEFORE you actually lose all the weight (in some cases, days after surgery)? You're not eating, anymore! You stomach has been stapled shut to the size of a walnut! Far less insulin is being produced and now your body can deplete glycogen stores in the liver and, then, go after the stored fat. Once excess bodyfat begins to be used as energy (in lieu, of food), blood sugar levels begin to stabilize almost immediately. Is fasting bad for you? Google it; Don't make me do all the work for you! Do you lose muscle when you fast? No. Does your metabolism slow during fasting? Not unless you decide to sleep in a cave for the next three months, no food. Is fasting expensive? Only for morons, it is. Are there rules for fasting? None that I know of?  Should I fast without telling my doctor? Only if you know absolutely nothing about Diabetes or have difficulty making a phone call without assistance.  The bottomline: If you lose weight, your Type 2 Diabetes will improve. If you stop eating, you will lose weight. 2+2=4 If you stop eating, your Type 2 Diabetes will improve. Fasting reduces insulin resistance...PERIOD!     PS: I just think it's very odd that nobody, out there, has responded to my posts, of late. All of them (posts) is centered around the same central theme: What if the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes has nothing to do with HIGH BLOOD SUGAR and everything to do with reducing INFLAMMATION & INSULIN RESISTANCE? Ie. What if the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes was LOWERING insulin levels, not raising them (which most diabetes medications are designed to do)? Then, that would mean, all these millions and millions of people who've been taking pills to ""artificially"" lower high blood sugar were actually doing nothing to stop the ""progression"" of Type 2 Diabetes. Then, that would mean, that they're symptoms would worsen over time despite making every effort (thru diet, exercise, stress management, etc) to keep them at bay. Then, that would mean, as taxpayers, we're paying billions of dollars in faux treatment protocols, that simply just don't work. In fact, the population in the US is getting fatter and more diabetic... ...and, who would receive all this trillions in money, either directly or indirectly, designed to treat Type 2 Diabetes? Medicine and Pharmaceuticals, that's who. We have a doctor, here, now. Not one word. Nobody, not one word in defense of present day treatment of Type 2 Diabetes?  Say, ""Bahhhhhhhhhh"". Like my dad use to say, ""Don't cry about it; Do ""something""! That's why its so ""odd"" and ""eerie"", this board. It's like the ""zombie apocalypse"".

However, his doctor yesterday basically told him he was prediabetic and noted ""IMPAIRED FASTING BLOOD SUGAR"" in his chart, even though he's never had an elevated fasting blood sugar level.

My mother always took her meds and checked her blood sugar. If it seemed high, around 180, then she made sure to make extreme adjustments. We have since found out that her BG went up to 428 and they are claiming that she refused to take her meds. I believe she wasn't alert enough to make that decision because she was going into diabetic coma. She passed away on June 19 from STEMI ecg, internal bleeding. What is your opinion? I don't recall her BG getting above 200 at home (her machine records). I picked up her medical records and there is a note where it was ""missed"" to give her insulin when it was first noticed that here BG was in the 400s.

I see plenty of people still smoking in public, to this day. When you see a ""smoker"", now, what goes through your mind? What sort of ""judgments"" do you make about people who choose to smoke cigarettes...especially, in public? I smoked for almost 30 years and I can honestly say, in 2017, I have very little compassion and respect...because, it's common knowledge: cigarettes shorten lives.  With that said , let's discuss alcohol for a moment...  It is clearly well accepted that ""excessive"" consumption of alcohol is ""bad"". Not only is it bad from a health perspective, but from a social perspective, alcohol clearly plays a pivotal role in a large percentage of abusive, violent and criminal events we routinely observe in daily life. As a parent sending your kids away to college, what's the first things you warn them about living away from home for the first time? If it's not about the dangers of off-campus alcohol and drug abuse, I can honestly say, you're either, A. naive, B. in denial, C. an imbecile, or D. an alcoholic (like I use to be), yourself. But, what I found to be most interesting (or, ""suspect"") were studies that ""proved"" that ""moderate"" alcohol consumption was good for you. That it was, in fact, ""healthy"". Now, how itf can something bad for your health, in large amounts, be good for you, in ""moderation"". lol Kinda like like eating poison mushrooms or produce with pesticides, how can eating a little bit, not only be OK, but actually good nutrition? Intuitively, that's a tough nut to crack, right?  And, now, decades after the first studies about those self-righteous ""Mediterraneans"" :)...the experts are beginning to reverse course. Maybe, what's bad for you in large amounts, may actually be bad for you in small amounts, too.  But, don't worry, just, yet. For all the ""social"" drinkers, out there, reading this, take heart! My guess, is there'll be plenty of ""rebuttal""studies, forthcoming, soon. Take comfort in knowing the beer, wine and spirits guys will not go quietly in the night! Distillers are not going to knuckle under to public pressure like the cigarette and soda folks, before them. When it comes to protecting ""turf"", these dudes are tougher, more ruthless than the NRA.

I am not having any luck keeping a bandage on the toe, so my doctor recommended that I could just keep it clean with soap and water and wear clean cotton socks. I would like to know if it would be a good idea to soak my feet in a solution of epsom salts or if that would not be a good idea. I also purchased a pro-foot vita-gel toe protector, but when I got home, I noticed that it is not recommended for use by diabetics. If I do end up using it, would it make a difference whether I applied antibiotic ointment, or would antibiotic cream be a better idea?

I then received the change and put them in my pocket. I went to another place and spent nearly 3 hours and then I decided to take a cab. As I was about to pay, the driver, one of the money bills seemed to have dark brown spots which I suspect is blood. I thought it was dried. I handed that bill to the driver. When I got home after like 30 minutes, I happened to pick my nose with the same finger that touched the money with the dark brown spots. I mean nose is also a mucosa and I worried if the spots in that money came from an HIV positive individual. I have no other risk factors and just asking if I can get HIV from nosepicking from finger that could have touched the spots in the money. I am worried. Thank you",Possible Exposure

Posted Sep 07, 2016     How many of you, out there, understand the link between Obesity, Type 2 Diabetes and Alzheimer's? Excerpts from article, above... ""...The more insulin levels rise, the more insulin resistant cells become. Over time, this vicious cycle can lead to persistently elevated blood glucose levels, or type 2 diabetes..."" ""...the level of glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding your brain is always about 60% as high as the level of glucose in your bloodstream—even if you have insulin resistance—so, the higher your blood sugar, the higher your brain sugar..."" ""...While most brain cells don’t require insulin in order to absorb glucose, they do require insulin in order to process glucose. Cells must have access to adequate insulin or they can’t transform glucose into the vital cellular components and energy they need to thrive. Despite swimming in a sea of glucose, brain cells in people with insulin resistance literally begin starving to death..."" ""...Which brain cells go first? The hippocampus is the brain's memory center. Hippocampal cells require so much energy to do their important work that they often need extra boosts of glucose. While insulin is not required to let a normal amount of glucose into the hippocampus, these special glucose surges do require insulin, making the hippocampus particularly sensitive to insulin deficits. This explains why declining memory is one of the earliest signs of Alzheimer’s, despite the fact that Alzheimer’s Disease eventually destroys the whole brain..."" Inflammation is a direct cause of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a direct cause of Type 2 Diabetes. And, now, they've connected the dots between Alzheimer's and insulin resistance. The test for insulin resistance is the measurement of fasting blood glucose, A1C and insulin levels. Insulin resistance is treated by ""lifestyle modifications"" and in some (most) cases, ""medications"". If the treatment of insulin resistance is through ""LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS"", and, it has been ridiculously well established, now, how utterly vital it is to NOT TO BE INSULIN RESISTANT... then, why be vague about the treatment of INSULIN RESISTANCE? Why doesn't the medical profession spell it out for everyone, when your doctor talks about ""Lifestyle Modifications""? Don't you think it's a wee bit odd, every single post, here, ends with the question, ""Should I be worried...?"" They are worried because they are CLUELESS. They are worried because they have no idea how to properly treat Type 2 Diabetes (aka, insulin resistance)... The truth is, nobody knows what ""insulin resistance"" is because nobody cares! But, when your lower legs and feet feel like they're on ""fire"", when you start to lose sight in an eye and, worst but not least, when you accuse your spouse of hiding your car keys or glasses, that's the time we should learn about ""insulin resistance""?  Obamacare or Trumpcare; what difference does it make? No insurance can possibly ""cover"" what insulin resistance does to the human body. Not one word in any medical insurance coverage addresses the prevention of ""insulin resistance"". And, the treatment of insulin resistance, now, represents 8% of our entire Gross National Product! Gee, if we could understand what ""lifestyle modifications"" meant, what could we do with almost a trillion dollars?  If any disease ""progresses"", that means it getting WORSE. If you're doctor is having to increase the dosage of drugs, prescribed, that means it's getting worse. Of course, it's every patient's ""fault"" their disease is ""worsening"". They're the ones not following ""instructions"". They're the ones, not losing weight! We are know, patients are ""weak"" and without ""discipline""... So, why be vague? If the treatment for insulin resistance is ""Lifestyle Modifications"", why not spell it out like we're 5 year olds? Why must people be ""worried"" about Type 2 Diabetes? Answer: Because. Nobody cares enough (to demand the madness stop). On your next doctor appointment, tell your doctor, ""I don't want to be Type 2 Diabetic, anymore. Tell me what I need to do to ""reverse"" my diabetes."" Just do it!",

For a country that is drowning in fresh, clean drinking water, such a large percentage of the population doesn't drink enough of it. At least 50% of the doctor visits for women end with the physician reminding the patient to drink more (freakin') water. Infections, constipation, muscle & joint pain, headaches, severe menstrual cramps, gout, insomnia, skin disorders, gum disease, chronic fatigue and, of course, Type Diabetes can be exacerbated by lack of fluid in-take. You can eat the healthiest diet in the world & exercise for hours...it will be all for nothing without enough water. The countries with the least amount of available fresh drinking water suffer the greatest health threats. Lack of water is the most insidious and destructive form of malnutrition. People come to this board complaining of chronic, unrelenting symptoms. They've tried ""everything"". Everything, that is, except drink more water!  75% of seniors over the age of 65 suffer from dehydration. Billions could be saved...BILLIONS!!!!!!!!!!!...if these people could simply drink more water. It's absolutely pathetic! If a medical equipment manufacturer could design a simple & easy device allowing seniors to receive intravenous fluid replenishment while watching Judge Judy, every afternoon, we could cut our taxes a huge amount. We seldom miss ""Happy Hour"" and, never, our morning Starbucks. But, we can't remind ourselves to drink a cup of water every couple hours.

She eats very healthy and walks 5 miles, everyday. She has less than 18% bodyfat. Yet, she doesn't drink enough of water! She's only 26 and suffering health issues you wouldn't believe...and, there's little I can do to help her because she can't establish the habit of drinking water throughout her day. PS: Every individual with Type 2 Diabetes, you could be suffering entirely unnecessarily. This is why I always say, each person is different, each case is different and people can't seem to get this through their thick skulls. The ""kicker"" is water consumption...at minimum, 64 to 72 oz! If you aren't drinking that much a day, you will continue to have problems no matter what you do. It's hard to drink more if you're not thirsty. I needed to drink more water to reverse my diabetes. It's hard, I know, but ""it is, what it is...""",

And I know some will say it dies right away but then how can he test my blood once it is outside my body for a couple seconds?

I am a 73 yr old, 20 year diabetic. When I finally retired and was able to eat what I wanted to, I lost weight and my blood sugar readings dropped and stayed low. I eat good foods. I buy blueberries and other 'healthy' foods. When I get hunger or 'tasty', I simply  eat something good from my pantry. Since I like all the things I buy (for the most part), My hunger is satisfied. When I go out, I eat basically anything I want; although most of what I choose is good for me. Now, having done this for awhile, I am 40+ pounds lighter, my AIC in the 6.3 area. What I am trying to say is that by surrounding myself with quality good foods and eating foods FOR the goodness they contain, I have brought my diabetes in check. For breakfast today I'll have oatmeal with blueberries and raisins. Later, I'll eat a small tomato and two apricots (the tomato because I know it is good and the apricots before they go bad). I brought an avocato because of it's good fat, I''ll eat it later or tomorrow for sure.  Simply put I buy and eat foods that are listed as good for diabetics and then eat them because I need the nutrients. I may grab a few dates and a tomato. Later I will eat celery and peanut butter. Later still I will take my delicious $5 loaf of 9 grain and make a sandwich of chicken with loads of veggies. When I go out, I basically eat anything I want; very seldom is it a hot greasy cheeseburger.I only buy nutrious things. No chips, no soft drinks, rarely ice cream, good choices of meat (the -loins, etc. and not much), only healthy cereals, always guided by nutritious values. My diet is a way of life for me. I am aware that I choose the things I eat for health reasons not necessarily taste. But the truth is there are many things that are good for you and filling yourself with what you should eat is easier than you imagine. Try it, for the next week eat only 'good stuff'. Two eggs and great bread with juice. Later eat a raw tomato and some grapes. Keep eating good stuff all week- force yourself. If you can focus on the nutrients when you shop, it follows that you will eat them if available. Soon this will be the way you eat. It is a small difference, but it could change your life. You will learn to eat many small items over the day and rarely overeat. Simply put, By filling your shelves with 'good' foods and forcing yourself to eat them, you'll just naturally become slim and healthy, diabetic or not.","Exercise , Insulin , Treatments , Diet , Type 2 Diabetes"

He’s married and said he’s clean, I don’t know if he’s been tested recently or not. I cam home the next day and went to my doctor, and he said there’s no need for PEP and should only be used in high risk situations because of the side effects? I couldn’t sleep last night. It’s only been 53 hours. Should I find someone else or go to the emergency room to get PEP? Is it worth it past 48 hours?

Find a meat bone...chicken, beef, ham, turkey...an big onion, some carrots, some sweet potatoes, some bell peppers, some garlic cloves, some celery, a bay leaf, some great northern or kidney beans. Add water. Sprinkle salt and pepper. Set to ""low"". Come back in 8 to 10 hours. Eat (and grin).  Bone broth soups are the one food staple found in every culture around the world...except in the US! The fact that Americans don't eat soup on a regular basis is a key reason why Obesity and Type 2 diabetes is a major health issue, here, imo. Bone broth soup is ancient food. You can be be bonehead and still make great bone broth soup. Bone broth soups make you horny. Bone broth soups are cheap, delicious, filling and, most of all, supremely nutritious.  Need to lose weight? Eat nothing but a bone broth soup for 14 days and you will lose 5%. Why?  Because, bone broth soups are completely nutritious but cause no inflammation in the gut. If you maintain no inflammation in the gut for 14 days, your body will release a ton of water. &, each gallon of water at sea level weighs 8 1/2 pounds.  Most fat people will counter: ""Losing water doesn't count! I need to lose fat!""    Wrong! Fat people don't carry nearly as much fat as they do, water! Fat people are fat because they eat foods that cause inflammation. It is this inflammation that causes their body to retain water. Unfortunately, water retention raises blood pressure which, in turn, tends to upset blood glucose control. &, this is why 9 out of 10 Type 2 Diabetics are either overweight or obese!  Fat people don't eat non inflammatory, bone broth soup, everyday. I don't know what they eat. I don't care to know what they eat. All, I know is, if you eat bone broth soup several times each week, you ain't overweight or obese (I don't know what progresso and campbells are but it aint the same as bone broth soup). It's ironic that for a country like the US, so obsessed with fine cuisine, alcohol, and weight loss and not one word, not one show, to teach people how to heal themselves through food. Bone broth soup is one of the simplest, easy and economical ways to do it. Once you witness the ""magic"" between weight loss and tighter blood glucose management, you will become inspired to eat even more bone broth soup! And, the more you eat, the better you'll feel. Reversing Type 2 Diabetes is about understanding how to minimize inflammation in your body. Regular consumption of bone broth soup is a great foundational step towards healing your body, once and for all.",

About sixty days ago, I had anal sex with a man I met. I didn't use a condom, but he told me he is HIV negative, and he is on PrEP. I was the receptive partner (the bottom), but he didn't ejaculate inside me. Since we had sex, I've been sort of freaking out. About four days after exposure, I had flu/cold-like symptoms (although I don't believe I reached a fever) that lasted about a week. For the past month, I've had diarrhea on and off. Over the past few days, I've had diarrhea fairly consistently. I had a 4th generation antigen/antibody test about 47 days after exposure, and I tested negative. Because I looked it up and read that the antigens may disappear after a certain time and then be undetectable, I decided to test myself again (on day 58) using a standard take-home oral swab antibody test, and I again tested negative. I plan to test again at 3 months, but I could use some advice. Is it likely that I could still be positive, even though I took the 4th-generation test and then another test a week and a half later?

I'll bet zero. You know why this is? I'll bet the drug companies have something to do with it... Total Cholesterol: Recently, cardiologists are now recommending everyone's level should be below 200 at all ages, but, in reality, it's a moving target range... = Upper level is 230 + age, Max 300 = Lower level is 115 + age Triglycerides: = Males upper level is 130 + age, Max 200 = Females lower level is 80 + age, Max 165 = Males/Females lower level is your age LDL: Normal range = 60-150 below age 20  = 70-180 age 30-50 = 80-210 above age 50 Any discussion on an individual's ""cholesterol"" is incomplete without some discussion on Hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism causes abnormal lipid metabolism which results in accelerated cardiovascular disease. The standard and most widely accepted measure for hypothyroidism is: ""TSH"" (thyroid-stimulating hormone). The official TSH ""normal range"" is 0.5 to 5.0.  On that range, a TSH under 0.5 (a low TSH) indicated hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid), and a TSH over 5.0 (a high TSH) indicated hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid.) Diabetes combined with Hypothyroidism (TSH > 5.0) is not a safe place to be.  Also, do your gums bleed when you brush your teeth even though you don't have a blood coagulation disorder? If they do, you likely have either have periodontal disease or Vitamin C deficiency or both. Either condition predisposes you to cardiovascular disease. Platelet count can identify bleeding disorders and slow clotting issues. Frequent presence of blood on your toothbrush is a bad ""sign"" and should not go ignored.  One of the simplest ways to identify basic health and diabetes/coronary issues is the ""WAIST Test"". Your waist measure should not exceed 1/2 your height in inches. I'm 5'10"" tall so my height is 70 inches. Therefore, to pass the WAIST Test, my waist measure should not exceed 35 inches. Insurance companies are good at making money because their actuaries are very knowledgeable in determining risks. Why do you think they insist on knowing your ""height"" and ""waist"" measurements as part of your insurance physical? Failing the WAIST Test is a strong indicator of pre-diabetes/diabetes and, consequently, a useful indicator of cardiovascular disease.  This is why, if you are independently paying for either life or health insurance and you, now, pass the WAIST test whereas, previously, you did not, ask your insurer if you may qualify for a lower rate. Don't be surprised if you save some money, either.",

It is fall and full of bad weather, and I normally get allergies at some point this season, but again I go to the worst outcome. The stupidly anxious part about all this is that it did not last very long (~5 min) and he did not ejaculate in my mouth, so the most there would have been was pre-cum and probably not even much of that. Also, I did not have any mouth sores or bleeding (though I do have sensitive gums in general, they wouldn't have been bleeding at the time), open wounds (nor did he), nor were there any visible cuts/bumps/problems with his penis.

But 10 days after this possible exposure I got my nodes swolen. They stayed like that for couple of days and went away. I had other symptoms like itchy hands in the morning. Actually to this day these symptoms are coming and going but its rare. Like every once in a week. Doctor said if you had hiv, swolen nodes wouldnt go away and came back. Anyhow, the problem is I get these symptoms I never had. 2 days ago I discovered scrabs in my hair. I checked it online. Site gave 12 reasons and last one is about HIV. I always have these little symptoms linked to HIV somehow and I am about to break down mentally. for symptoms I sometimes get very little bumps in my mouth. I sometimes have backpain. I dont feel sick or tired. But those little things are still there. The problem is I always had low Vitamin D count so in the first month I got medication to raise it so I always think can this medication somehow delay seroconversion this much? I know it’s a long shot but when It comes to your life and potentially someone elses, these tiny chances can make you go mad. Thanks in advence",

HIV/AIDS,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/hiv-aids/33918/three-negative-oraquick-tests-but-having-symptoms,"Three negative oraquick tests, but having symptoms","So about three months ago I met this guy who was friends with some of my friends. We had unprotected oral and protected vaginal sex twice (once eleven weeks ago and once seven weeks ago), after the second time a couple days later I noticed sores on my vagina that I assumed were herpes which made sense to me since he had performed unprotected oral sex on me. A couple days later I got it tested and came back positive for HSV 1, typically oral herpes. I started to get anxious about my HIV status, I had never been tested before but after contracting herpes I thought I should. Well I also just started birth control at thattime and about four to five days later started to experience mild headaches which I at first attributed to that. I also had had a cough for a month at that point that I thought nothing of. Well six weeks later I noticed a dry patch in between my fingers that was very itchy. I had a history of eczema so I bought cortozone lotion for it and it disappeared in around a day. I started to have really bad anxiety about it though and then started experiencing a sore neck and shoulders and sorenessunder my shoulder. I freaked out and bought an oraquick test (6 and ten weeks post exposure) which came back negative but it still didn't calm me down. I went to the clinic and had the nurse check to see if I had swollen lymph nodes which she said I didn't but I'm doubtful of her assessment. She also said a lot of my symptoms could be due stress. I was still nervous so I bought another oraquick oral swab test a couple days later which again came back negative. Then one night I woke up twice with night sweats and that really terrified me. I bought my last test at 7 and 11 weeks post possible risk events (I should note I'm unaware of this mans HIV status but he says he is negative. I'm pretty sure he isn't gay or an IV drug user which ik would greatly reducehis risk of having it, ive also asked his friends all of whom have said he doesn't have it) and it came back negative also but just this morning I noticed a possible cankor sore in my mouth. I haven't had these in years and it terrified me because I know that this is one of the symptoms of HIV. so my questions are 1. What is the chance I would contract HIV through giving oral sex without ejaculation, but possible pre ejaculation (ik a risk factor is open sores in mouth, I cant remember if I had any at the time but my wisdom teeth have been coming in for about a year. They don't bleed at all I was wondering if those count) 2. How accurate would my three oraquick tests be with the last possible exposure being 6-7 weeks ago testing negative 3. Could my symptoms really all be attributed to stress 4. Could taking antibiotics for herpes 5 weeks ago (I took them for four days) be delaying my production of antibodies, ik certain things like chemo therapy and bad immune systems can I was wondering if that could be why my tests are negative please someone answer I am worried sick I am going to get a blood prick tomorrow I'm so scared it will come back positive","Possible Exposure , Symptoms , Home Testing Kits"

Talk to your health care provider right away (within 3 days) about taking medicine to prevent getting HIV (called post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP) if you or your partner might have been recently exposed to HIV, like if the condom breaks during sex and the HIV-positive partner is not virally suppressed.

Partners can make different kinds of choices about their sexual partnerships to try to lower their chances of getting or transmitting HIV. This includes being in a monogamous relationship, choosing partners with the same HIV status (serosorting), and having sex agreements to protect themselves and their partners from HIV.

For example, you may not be certain of your HIV status, or you may not want to tell your partner if you had sex outside the relationship.

After my follow with the Gastro Dr. everything was fine. So when I started bleeding from kidney I didn’t think the procedure was the factor since I was bleeding from the kidneys.At the time I was seeing a rheumatologist for problems that I had been experiencing for a few years. I made an appt to see her but as I got near the appt they cancelled me and now the appt is pushed back a month. By the time I finally was sent to the right Dr. Now 3 months have passed. I was diagnosed with stage 3 kidney disease. 4 yrs into ckd my kidney I was stage 5 and after having several biopsies they couldn’t come up with my cause. After going to Mayos my kidney is back to stage 3. So my Dr. Of 10 yrs. said he still thought my ckd is caused by an autoimmune disease. I accepted it. Now as a procrastinator and waited 10 yrs. my colonoscopy is scheduled in 2 weeks. After talking to my Gastro Dr. He said I could have had kidney trauma from the prep for the procedure. I had the pills and I understand with research into the matter these could have been a cause. My caring Dr. Of 10 yrs.( and he has done a wonderful job) doesn’t think this was ever a factor and completely dismisses my concern. Now I’m nervous that I may not make the right decision based on my gut feeling. The first 4 yrs. of ckd I felt like I had the flu everyday. I don’t know if I can go back to that feeling again. I know the Prep has improved but I still see there are risks. Thank youDeb,Kidney Disease

Pretty healthy but not terribly healthy (cholesterol 188, blood pressure 120/80, 5' 10' 220) I know I need to lose weight and I am working on it. For six years, I was a daily alcohol abuser. I drank around 6-10 beers every other day and sometimes daily. Recently, I quit and had some tests done to ensure I am healthy. My bloodwork and liver enzymes all came as normal (surprisingly). I had an EKG done to test for damage which was normal. However, I had an abdominal ultrasound done to check my organs to make sure they were ok. Surprisingly, my Liver is OK and I don't even have fatty liver after 5+ years of alcohol abuse. Everything was OK except apparently I have a cyst on my right kidney (singular cyst). I am only 26 years old. I am alarmed since it seems only people 50+ get them. I used to smoke synthetic marijuana (I smoke marijuana generally but haven't in almost a year) and I know it can damage kidneys so I kind of blame that. I want to know though, at 26 with a kidney cyst, can I still live a long healthy life? It is not a tumor or maligant, just a kidney cyst. My doctor didn't seem too concerned just told me to get an ultrasound every 6-12 months to make sure everything is OK. Please let me know what your opinion on this is as I am very worried I may get Kidney cancer later on in life now. Is Kidney cysts at a young age curable? Are they common at all? Most importantly, can I still live a normal, healthy long life and raise a family without dying early? Thank You I appreciate it.","Kidney Cyst , Kidney Disease"

I fasted for blood tests and my blood sugar was 13.  A couple of weeks ago, my blood sugar was suddenly 63. Last week it was 150. My doctor asked me how many simple sugars I consume in a day. I said, I don't. I eat complex carbs, proteins, fresh vegetables, and fresh fruits. I drink caffeine free drinks like seltzer and Crystal Light and just plain bottled water so cold it's almost got ice crystals in it. I drink decaf coffee and tea, but never green tea because I think it tastes like hay smells. He said well, eat small frequent meals. I pointed out that I have been eating like that since I was 5, when I was diagnosed with chronic hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia makes sense to me. I've lived with it all my life. But these blasting high blood sugars are scaring me. They are above normal and they are far more consistent than the sudden drops to the 60s. And during the time that my blood sugar was staying in the 60s, I was not aware of it and I felt fine. When it goes up, I get shaky and dizzy and nauseated after I eat. One doctor suggested that I test my blood sugar during those post-meal really yucky feeling times. I almost laughed. When that starts, I have moments to get to my bed before I fall and hurt myself. I can hardly poke my finger, spread the blood on the strip, and insert the strip into the machine that reads it. And no, I don't have anyone who could help; I live alone. So ....

Also have a fear that my experience was not typical at all and may have only worked due to exact experience that would be hard to duplicate. So this is something that needs research and not an actual treatment. When I was about 30 years old I was told I needed to go on insulin, due to advanced diabetes. I am now 60 years old and so you can do the math and know what year that was. Problem was I had seen my parents and grandparents go through diabetes and insulin injections, diets, and early deaths, and was resistant to trying the therapy, to say the least. In fact I refused treatment and instead decided to do the opposite of what was conventional in treatments. I increased my sugar intake dramatically, until I was making myself sick from too much of it. At last I dropped off most sugars and used sodas, now I stick with Pepsi and Coke as they do not have the benzo chemicals as preservatives. How much am I drinking? 2-4 liters a day for the last 30 years. That's a bad idea according to my doctors, but I do not have diabetes as tested over & over, and my Body mass index is that of a 39 year old, no fat. Blood pressure is excellent. On the bad side however I have lost all my teeth and do have moderately high cholesterol. I have now outlived one of my grandparents and one of my parents as to age expectancy, and have not dieted a bit. That's it in a nutshell , do not try this yourself as when I did I expected to die rapidly instead of surviving, just didn't want to go through the heck my parents had. Instead I survived and prospered. I will try to answer questions if there are any but do doubt I can give a thorough enough explanation to advise researchers or doctors, just didn't want to die eventually without passing along my personal experience.","Insulin , Treatments , Diet , Living With , Type 1 Diabetes"

I hit the hospital, was preliminarily prepared when it turned out my cardiologist had not reported to the transplant people I had been put on Warfarin. Thank God I had my medicine list.

I respect my doctors and other medical professionals immensely, but I am genuinely desperate. In October (about 5 months ago) I visited my PCP after feeling sickly for weeks on end. I had been having low-grade fevers on a daily basis, joint pain and general aches, and fatigue so bad I would sleep for 16 hours. My blood work came back with normal CBC, but positive for mono. I was given prednisone (which did nothing) and told I would feel better in a week or two. 5 months later, my symptoms have only gotten worse. With my fevers come a bright red butterfly shaped rash across my face, and I am often too sick to get out of bed. I visited the doctor once again, who agreed that the fevers were not likely caused by the mono I had five months ago. She thought there was a chance of an autoimmune condition, so tested my ANA, CRP, CBC, ESR, and for lyme (for good measure). Yet, every single test came back within the normal range. I had been treated for kidney pain recently as well, but all that showed up in my urine was a little protein and white blood cells (but not an amount too excessive). With having tested negative for lupus, lyme, and any sort of infection, I do not know what to think. My fevers have not subsided, and the rash on my face shows up a few times a week at least (it's not itchy, just hot). I also continuously break out in hives, despite having had allergy testing (not sure if this is related). If I don't have an autoimmune condition, lyme, mono, or any infection, why on earth am I feeling so sick and what can I do to feel better? I feel like I have tried everything, and I eat and exercise well. Even pain meds do a poor job of relieving my symptoms.

I went to the ER and based on traces of blood in my urine, frequent urge to urinate and pain, they diagnosed me with a kidney stone. Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I started having a dull ache in my side, same side as last time. I assumed I pulled a muscle but the pain just would not go away. A few weeks after the ache started, I noticed that whenever I urinated it did not burn/minimal urgency, but rather felt like cramping in my lower abdomen. It would subside shortly after urinating. I went to a urologist who took urine and said no UTI/no blood. Sent me for CT scan and said I do have a small stone near the bottom of my right kidney ( he scanned my whole abdomen and pelvis to rule out ovarian cysts, fibroids, etc. and all was clean). My question is why did I feel cramping upon urinating when the stone has not descended? Is it possible I had passed another small stone so that's why? I swear I feel pain when the stone moves within my kidney. Could this happen?? Thanks!",

If they remain high (&, if your T2 Diabetes is worsening) then you can be sure of one thing. Despite all the advise, despite all the drugs, despite all the exercise, despite all the frustration and worry, one thing is clear. You still believe, ""Diet does not matter"".  Here's an excerpt that is the most revealing ""take-away"" from this article:  ""...But how did we eat before then? Actually 'not that poorly'. At least not if you consider what we thought was healthy... ...So we had a pretty 'normal' diet, and I think, better than most people..."" I believe this is how most Type 2 Diabetics think...that they eat ""pretty healthy"". When you think about it, what mother would attest, otherwise??? What mother would subject all 5 of her kids to such unspeakable pain and suffering? Clearly, this woman is well educated and loves all her children dearly. So, why doesn't her story reconcile? How could every one of her kids suffer suicidal mental health issues yet still be a ""good"" mother? She IS a GOOD mother! &, her mother was a GOOD mother, too! Their only ""mistake"" was simple.

In the United States, HIV is spread mainly by having anal or vaginal sex or sharing drug injection equipment with a person who has HIV. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the use of HIV medicines to treat HIV infection. People on ART take a combination of HIV medicines (called an HIV regimen) every day.

Some articles say it happens when it's advanced and others say it can happen within a few days of exposure. I'm super paranoid and feel like anything that is happening to my body is a symptom of ARS. Even when I sneeze I'm scared that it might be the beginning of the ""flu like symptoms"" associated with ARS. Could the thrush be an indication of HIV? So far I haven't had any other symptoms, except my lower left side of my back started to ache a little bit today, which could also be one of the symptoms of ARS.

Kidney Disorders,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/kidney-disorders/34885/pcnl-experiences,PCNL Experiences,"I am posting this because I don't think there is enough information available of what PCNL surgery is like. This is only my experience, I'm no professional, but I hope it helps to reassure and prepare others. I have Cystinuria, a genetic kidney disease where my kidneys produce too much cystine and my kidneys think sparkly yellow stones are a great idea. I had a mass in my left kidney that got blasted with lithotripsy when I was seven but we were only just told about cystinuria recently when we discovered stagnorn stones in both my kidneys. My kidney function is 78% in my right and 22% in my left, which added some risk to the situation.  They decided to clear my right kidney first, since that is the most important, and so one week ago I went into hospital for a right PCNL. When they set you up in theatre, you fall asleep on your back, but they roll you onto your side, once out, so they can access your kidney. A scope is put through your side into your kidney and a guide wire is threaded up through your urethra etc so they don't get lost. Various tools are put through the scope to break up and extract the stone fragments. When I woke up, the first thing I knew was that I needed to pass urine so badly it hurt. This, of course, wasn't the case. The uege to urinate is common, they had emptied my bladder and in my case my bladder and muscles were spasming. A day later the spasms meant I still couldn't pass urine and they put an indwelling catheter in to relieve the strain on my smaller left kidney. This pain was a 10 on the pain scale. Before your surgery, ask if you will need a catheter and ask if it can be inserted while you are under. My next one will be. I had two J stents inserted in the surgery. These are tubes that go from your kidneys to your bladder in your uretas. They allow urine to pass both ways, which meant until I got the catheter, my left kidney was sending waste to my bladder and then up to my right kidney. Finally, I had what is called a nethrostomy tube. It is a thin tube left in place of the scope to allow your kidney to be drained while you heal. It's a safety measyre in case your kidney clots up at the entrance to your stent. Here is where things went wrong for me. My nethrostomy tube somehow got dislodged from my kidney and got stuck in the surrounding fatty layer. This resulted in acute pain that would only subside with iv morphine. The nethrostomy site leaked every day and had to be redressed a lot. Most of the nurses hadn't really dealt with nethrostomy tubes, lor hadn't encountered my type. Some assumed I was exaggerating the pain. Some thought my tube was blocked with clots and then some of those people tried to flush it with saline. Flushing the tube can be risky, but seemed to give results so they kept doing it. Sometimes nothing would drain, I would be curled in the foetal position in bed unable to move or barely breath, and they would refuse iv morphine. They will make you get up and walk around the next day. This is to prevent clots and pneumonia. They will also be rather obsessed with when you poop. I got constipated and didn't go for four days. The catheter made it harder for me, but that's all working fine now. They made me wait days for a special xray scan with a contrast solution. This is a standard procedure after PCNL so they can track your kidney's drainage into your bladder to see if it is safe to remove the stents and nethrostomy tube. It's also to make sure your surgeon got all the stones. I was in so much pain, they had to slide me from my bed to the table under the enormous fancy machine. The staff wear lead vests and the room has to be kept cold for the machinery. When they injected the dye, that is when they realised the tube was dislodged. This raised questions of how was my tube leaking/draining if it wasn't in my kidney. There were talks of sending me back into surgery days before Christmas, lucky for me the urology team decided to take the nethrostomy tube out. Taking the tube out is uncomfortable, but not as bad as you expect. When you're sent to your ward, after surgery, the orderlies bring a wrapped up plastic doohicky that can go down into the tube, 'unlock' it and pull it out. It's over quickly, especially if you're exhaling while the tube comes out. My pain instantly subsided when it came out. They observed me overnight, took out the catheter and discharged me lunchtime the next day. ORDINARILY, upon a successful scan, they would remove your nethrostomy tube and stents all at once under a local anaesthetic. Because of my complications that were unnecessarily dragged out, I'll be getting a CT scan and then they'll be removed after Christmas. I hope this is helpful/insightful. I have to go back for my left kidney once I've recovered and hopefully I'll be able to add thoughts of a more standard experience then.","Kidney Stones , Kidney Disease"

It has 8 suggestions of snacks that won't spike your blood sugar. What are your thoughts? Any snacks you would add to this list? Or ones you would take off? My grandmother (who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes a while back) lived with my family for a time, and finding snacks that she could eat that wouldn't have a negative effect on her blood sugar was always a challenge. It became another kind of challenge after she was diagnosed with dementia -- before that she knew what was and wasn't good for her to eat when, how it may affect her, and the correct portion sizes. After, we had to closely monitor everything that she ate, and we basically had to start from scratch. Because she had always taken such good care of herself, none of rest of us were really that involved in her day-to-day care up until that point (something that in hindsight was not a good thing).  All of that to say that I wish I had a slideshow like this to work off of. I know that all snacks don't work for all people, but just to know if you're in the right ballpark is nice. Unsalted nuts were one of her go-to snacks and egg whites were a breakfast staple, but the others on the list we didn't really explore.","Diet , Living With , Type 2 Diabetes , Type 1 Diabetes"

I have what I describe as visible calcifications in my dip joints from trauma. I have ruled out gout(low uric acid levels), osteoarthritis(herberden nodes), arthritis(13 Rheumatoid factor). There is no visible sign of herberden nodes under x-ray examination. My main hunch is that it is pseudogout being caused by elevated pth levels despite being normocalcemic. I've been tested twice for pth levels along with calcium 1st Test-  PTH 71pg/mL (14-64 range) Calcium 9.4 mg/dL(8.6-10.3 mg/dL range) Vitamin D - 25ng/mL (30-100 range) The endo requested I go on vitamin D because she believes it is secondary hyperparathyroidism. After 3 months of 50k IU of vitamin D2 The vitamin D supplementation gave me extreme and constant trips to the bathroom, 5-8 bowel movements daily. 2nd Test- PTH 81 Calcium 9.4 Vitamin D- 27 I also have several other calcium results that range from 9.4-10.1 . Bowel movements normalized after she requested I go on 2000 IU of D3, which I instead opted to buy cod liver oil of 400IU of D3.  I suspect that the reaction to high vitamin D dosages indicates fat soluble vitamins malabsorbtion. One of the possible causes was gallbladder disease. I have not passed any kidney stones or anything, but after going to the ER with pain in my stomach, I insisted that they check my gallbladder(ultrasound) after reading possible causes of vitamin D malabsorbtion. Indeed I was found to have a fatty liver (Hepatic steatosis)along with multiple gallstones(cholelithasis). Also something no one mentioned to me was that my kidney walls were thickened.  The right kidney measures 11.8 x 5.2 x 6.0 cm the average size of an adult human kidney is about 10 to 13 cm (4 to 5 inches) long, approximately 5 to 7.5 cm (2 to 3 inches) wide and about 2 to 2.5 cm (1 inch) thick. My main suspicion is that there must be stones in my urinary system also or nephrotic syndrome, high blood pressure, high triglycerides I have to meet with a surgeon soon to discuss treatment of my gallbladder, they will probably insist on taking it out.

My first 2 (8 & 9 yrs ago)had to be surgically removed and ever since then I have passed each one on my own, although it normally takes me several weeks typically. About 2.5 weeks ago I started having really bad pain on my back/side, nausea, urinary urgency, along with a few other of my classic kidney stone symptoms. I have been drinking like crazy since then and taking Flomax 1x day. The pain only lasted 2 days and then it went to my normal being ""crampy"" on my side here and there like I usually have. The urinary urgency has not left. At times it's really bad and other times it's not. I have had a pinching pain down there a few times which with previous kidney stones for me meant it dropped into my bladder and my symptoms were then all gone.  My situation and question is this. I do not have health insurance right now and cannot afford to go to the urologist for self pay ($600 min). If the urinary urgency is so bad at times and I've had that pinching pain a few times, doesn't it sound like the stone is right there at the bladder drop and just stuck and not dropping? I know if it had dropped into the bladder and just hasn't passed then my symptoms would all be gone so I know that's not it. Is it possible that the stone has made it all the way through the ureter but is too big to drop into the bladder? (I think not if it made its way through the ureter.)

I will start off saying I have been battling anxiety, depression and hypochondria for 10 years. 28 years old and was in a relationship for 6 year up until October 2016. From December - March 2016 I was seeing someone and we eventually had unprotected sex a handful of times. She was in a previour relationship for 2 years. She had been previously tested for std’s. Come to March/April 2017, a girl had performed oral sex on me and had given me chlamydia. I ran to the clinic after I realized the symptoms I was having. I had performed an hiv at home test that had shown up negative as I was freaking out about the girl I was sleeping with. The test was negative. The urgent care place I went to had tested me for some std’s as well. HIV tested negative, chlamydia was positivre so I treated with one dose of I forgot what it was. I had no sexual contact up until about 3 weeks ago with someone I have known for a while. Her last partner (2nd person she has ever slept with) was sep 2016. She had a full std screening may 2017 with everything negative. Three weeks ago we had slept together. The condom broke and she said she was tested in may and has not slept with anyone since 2016. Around that time, maybe a few days later I had a dream my mother told me I had leukema. I have been freaking out over that and another HIV scare. I have been having tightness in my right testicle and cant stop obsessing over both. I have mollescum rash on my stomach and penis as well. The doctor at the health clinic looked at it and said it’s not genital warts. They ran a rapid hiv blood draw that was negative 3 days ago. She tried to calm me down. Today I am itchy.

Kidney Disorders,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/kidney-disorders/19274/kidney-stone-help,Kidney Stone help,"I have had Kidney Stones for 10+ years. My stone type is Calcium-Oxalate. I tried every diet, tried drinking water, lemonade, everything else they suggested, they still come back. Every time I went to the urologist they always told me that while the kidney stones are inside my Kidney that they won't cause pain. Most of the time they would still write me a prescription for Norco and send me on my way. I'd keep telling them that the Norco wasn't really helping that basically I would have to take so much of it I was in la la land and didn't care about the pain anymore but it wasn't stopping the pain most of the time.  About 3 years ago my stones were so bad they had to go in and remove them via surgery, lithotripsy wasn't working on them. They came back and last year they had to do lithotripsy again. Now, I've been having back trouble for 6+ months not sleeping well and I went to the Urologist and I have a 12mm stone in each kidney. He told me that they were not blocking my ureter that it couldn't be the source of my back pain plus I had a stone in my other kidney but it doesn't hurt on that side. He diagnosed me with something Sponge Kidney. He sent me home with an appointment in six months to check them again and hopefully by then I could get insurance and they could do the surgery. The medicine they have been trying to put me on costs over 100 dollars a month which I cannot afford. He gave me no advice as to what to do even though I told him it was so bad I was being forced to self-medicate with alcohol just so I could get some rest. I went to my regular doctor and they checked that it wasn't muscular or skeletal problems causing my pain and to go back to him for a reevaluation. She wrote me a prescription for Meloxicam 15mgs once a day which helps to a small degree she told me it helps make it manageable, well it's manageable about every other day as long as I don't do anything at all strenuous. The last time I tried Norco for this pain about a couple months ago it did NOTHING for the pain. It still put me into la la land, so it's not a tolerance problem, but the pain was so bad even that wasn't enough. I live with my mother whom I try to take care of and she makes barely too much money to qualify for any kind of help with insurance for me. It was going to cost us over $13,000 after the deductible before they would pay anything if I got insurance. That's almost a 1/5th of her yearly income. Most of the money she brings in goes out in bills from when my father was still alive. I am pretty certain that I will be turned down at the free clinic because of the household income and the same for the charity group, I am in my mid 30's and even though this condition is extremely disabling I'm almost positive I wouldn't qualify for disability. I don't care for the check I just need medical help. So here's my questions, is it ABOSOLUTELY impossible for your kidneys to hurt even if they stone is just sitting inside, and what advice can you guys give about finding help with my medical bills.",Kidney Stones

Diabetes,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/diabetes/901/leaky-gut-syndrome,Leaky Gut Syndrome,"Because of my drinking, smoking and exposure to toxic chemicals from work, my doctor believed my diabetes were caused by the following. Leaky Gut...     If you have this condition, it creates an environment of chronic, low grade inflammation in your body. This triggers your immune system to continually release anti-inflammatories in response to the ""injury"".  It's believed that this condition can contribute towards insulin resistance and possibly auto-immune disorders.  You need an exceptional dr. to diagnose this. What you can do instead, is maintain a ""symptom"" log and chronicle, periodically, signs of inflammation or infection: 1. Joint pain 2. Fatigue 3. Indigestion 4. Acid Reflux 5. Insomnia 6. Numbness 7. Skin rash 8. Susceptibility to cold & Flu 9. Headache, cough, congestion or chest pain 10. Allergies 11. Body odor, bad breath, tooth decay/loss 12. Weight gain 13. High blood sugar, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL 14. Emotional instability When I suffered from Type 2 Diabetes, I experienced ALL of these, REGULARLY. Now, that I've cured myself of T2D, I don't experience any of these symptoms. As you relieve yourself of stress and inflammation, the body is allowed time to repair and symptoms begin to fade, thereafter. I am 61.  PS: Obesity is a clear indication of inflammation and stress. Unless you take a full inventory of all sources of stress and inflammation your body is exposed to and begin the process of resolving, all, your body will work against your efforts to lose weight.  Think of obesity as an ""injury"", instead. You need to consume bland, healthy food, plenty of water, lots of sleep and, most importantly, support and understanding from friends and family in order to ""recover"" (lose weight). If you are insulin resistant (diabetic), too, this ""injury"" will respond to rehabilitation in exactly the same fashion. Resist the urge to reach for drugs and quick fixes. They can't facilitate repair which is what your body needs in order to lose the weight. If overweight, weight loss is the most impactful ""first step"" towards controlling (and, in some cases, reversing) Type 2 Diabetes.",

Yes I get therapy for these things.) So approximately 5 weeks ago, at the beginning of October, I performed oral sex on a guy without a condom (no anal/vaginal sex occurred). Someone I've known for a few years, and who has been with a few partners, but assured me afterwards he always uses condoms when having sex and is clean of STDs. Rational me believes this. But I worry. Recently, I've had some issues with headache, sore throat, general congestion, itchy skin (though I wouldn't say it's a defined rash...). Lately I've also found myself very forgetful and difficult to remember things in the short term. It is fall and full of bad weather, and I normally get allergies at some point this season, but again I go to the worst outcome. The stupidly anxious part about all this is that it did not last very long (~5 min) and he did not ejaculate in my mouth, so the most there would have been was pre-cum and probably not even much of that. Also, I did not have any mouth sores or bleeding, open wounds, nor were there any visible cuts/bumps/problems with his penis.  I have not been tested for HIV or any other STD. Is it even possible I'd have anything? All I ask for is peace of mind, or to just have someone say I am probably worrying way too much.","Risk Factors , Possible Exposure , Symptoms"

I was told in their most recent test of 6 months ago that they are negative. I was told it was a HIV test that was a blood drawn test. I do not know if it was a home test or in a professional setting. My first question is, could this be a false result? My second question is their partner who was diagnosed with HIV claims that they are undetectable in testing. Does this hold any validity?

Took 500mg 2 days in a row and then 250 for the last day, urination burn went away along with discharge after first dose but the rash on hands is still there. Stopped taking medication because of the symptoms I was experiencing: Abdominal pain, back pain, nervousness, sleeplessness, fatigue, chest tightening, vomiting sensation (but didn't), back pain, muscle cramps, chills, a higher heart rate, shortness of breath... Most symptoms faded now (3 days since off azithromycin), but still tight feeling where heart is though heart rate is fine, upper left back and left arm feel weak, and kidney-side portion of my abdomen is discomforted and hurts when I push into my kidney. I pee 2-3 times/day and it's a fair amount, but not as much as typical (by a longshot). Feel like I need to poop, but only get out a tiny bit once in the morning and once at night. Heart Rate returned to normal Feel okay but sluggish in the mornings, better but uncomfortable during the day, and the worst at night.  Concerned because don't want to ignore underlying symptoms of a bigger problem, but not sure if impatient for azithromycin to wear off and underestimating recovery time.

The dog was on my bed with me and he was stuck inside my anus. While I was passed out, the dog had *** me anally and knotted with me and was ejaculating in me. I tried to get him out of me, but couldn't. I kept trying and pushed as hard as I could finally passing out his penis and knot, but doing so tore me. I put my hand back there and saw fresh blood along with his cum. Some sick pervert had obviously trained him for sex with people. He only raped me that one time. I later found his owner. He was a very sickly looking gay man. He was glad I found his dog, but probably couldn't keep the dog, since he was going to an AIDS hospice. I was freaking out, but didn't tell him what his dog had done to me. So very nasty, but this gay guy with HIV/AIDS had been getting *** by his dog and who knows, maybe *** his dog as well. His dog had raped me, tore me, and his semen had mixed with my blood and open wound. I have read that dogs aren't affected by HIV/AIDS, which I hope is true, but can they still be a carrier of HIV, even though it doesn't affect them? Could the dog be carrying HIV from his owner and transmitted it to me during the rape? Still in shock about it. I haven't discussed with anyone.

Strictly relating to ARS. The only symptoms I have developed since then were:  1) Dry cough, 4 week duration  2) Discomfort in the throat on and off (but not your typical ""pins and needles"" sore throat), 5 week duration  3) Boils  4) On and off pain in my muscle (left forearm and heel tendon), 4 week duration and is now gone  7 weeks BEFORE my exposure with this female and I happened to have the misfortunate of having the condom slip out upon having sex. I may have been exposed to her vagina for roughly 30 seconds. 5 days later I did feel a bit tired or uneasy by the end of the week but immediately took my temperature twice during the day and evening and they both read 98.6 and 98.8 F, respectively (37 and 37.1 C, respectively). Since then I did not feel any overall body discomfort or fever.  Regarding my dry cough after my unprotected exposure I produced no phlegm or fever and the dry cough was more prominent when I would breathe in really deep or when I was laughing (pretty much gone at this point). Also less frequent or non-existent now, at the time I would get minor chest discomfort. I have been able to engage in 60-90 mins of high intensity cardio without having to catch my breath.  I have also noticed a weird ""discomfort"" in the throat which is the symptom that has lasted the longest. It is not your typical sore throat with the pins and needles feeling upon swallowing or eating but much rather a slight discomfort on the right side of the back of my throat that comes on and off throughout the day with a possible mass on the right side. BTW I visited a nurse practitioner who actually said she did not notice a mass but I still have this on and off ""sore throat discomfort"" that has been there for 3 weeks but I only just noticed the possible lymph node mass that was disregarded but I am not fully sure.  I have checked like crazy and to my knowledge have not noticed any enlarged lymph node in my axilla (shoulder), groin area or cervical area (besides the one mentioned above). I did however notices 3 boils, 2 in my groin/thigh area and armpit area which I ended up squeezing and they all produced pus meaning it was more like an infection but I'm not sure. Lastly, I also had severe skin itching that started almost a week after my exposure but it is basically gone now on or maybe it has subsided immensely or i don't notice anymore (NO RASH) and this on and off muscle/tendon ache for 4 weeks that constantly appears in heel tendons (more right than left foot) and my left forearm muscle but I do not have a general body ache. The ache could be there for a number of minutes (it varies from maybe 10 to 60 mins) and then suddenly reappear like an hour or two later or not at all during the day. Very confused by that.  I was worried about a possible Herpes infection too because of a dry scaly rash I noticed in my genital area 3 days after exposure (but that was brought up in another forum) which I heard can be related to nerve itching or pain that may be affecting my muscles so I am not sure. Very scared and worried I may have gotten HIV. Not sure what to do. Thoughts? I want to do maybe an orqauick or a rapid test at this point since it is free.

HIV/AIDS,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/hiv-aids/20524/extremely-concerned-late-ars,Extremely concerned late ARS,"87 days ago I had unprotected vaginal sex with a woman who I would consider to be high risk (due to meeting her off the internet), however I saw a GUM clinic at the time who considered this a low risk incident. I was definitely HIV negative at this time. About 2-3 weeks later I had an extremely uncomfortable sore throat, headache and tiredness and around this time my partner also started having headaches and tiredness. I also experienced an array of symptoms that were probably anxiety caused. At 28 days I had a full set of screening performed which came back negative. The clinic said that no further appointment was necessary. At once a lot of my anxiety symptoms disappeared completely but I continued to have sore neck/back muscles. I use a laptop for work so it is possible it could have been related to this. Two weeks ago I started to come down with something following my partner experiencing some gastrointestinal problems which she considered to be IBS. My symptoms for the past week+ have been as follows: -NO fever or rash -Throbbing, dull headache at the top of the head, EXTREME tiredness, struggling to focus/work -Moderate sore throat, sneezing, coughing, runny nose -Extremely stiff neck all of the time, nothing seems to help this -Dull aches which could be related to lymph nodes behind the ear, but no noticeable swelling -Extremely bad gastro problems/pain/pressure. Bloating and nausea all of the time. Around 20-30 mins after I eat my stomach goes into a frenzy of pain and bubbling which lasts for 1 hr, after this is fine. All foods/drinks seem to affect it the same. This is focused on the left side. -No diarrhoea or vomiting I had a subsequent HIV test at 84 days which I am waiting the results from. My questions are: 	-I can’t seem to isolate this to influenza or gastroenteritis (stomach flu) due to the combination of neck/head/throat/stomach symptoms all at the same time. I can safely say I have never experienced gastro problems like this in my life. Likewise, my partner having this same gastro problem means I know this is a viral infection of some sort. Is it at all likely that HIV could present itself in this way with no fever and no rash? Are there any other viruses which present themselves in both the respiratory and intestinal systems at the same time? 	-My negative 28 day test seems to be fairly conclusive based on what I can read. However, my symptoms at 2-3 weeks and now at 11-12 weeks are extremely concerning me. Is it possible that the lateness of my symptoms would correspond with a later seroconversion and subsequently my test results changing? Or is this far too late for ARS at this stage? 	-Are the dull aches behind my ear/stiff neck related to lymph nodes? Coincidental laptop use? Or just the effect of a general viral infection? 	-Would it be possible, if I transmitted HIV to my partner, that she would display ARS symptoms before me? Does each person react differently or would you expect the 1 week gap between myself contracting and my partner contracting to correspond with the timing of symptoms?  	-Overall, based on the fact this was a single incident with a woman, multiplied by the probabilities of my 28 day test etc, is it within reasonable possibilities that I do in fact HIV or is it possible to almost rule it out at this stage?","Possible Exposure , Symptoms , Diagnosis"

HIV/AIDS,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/hiv-aids/23753/concern-for-risk-and-possible-contraction-of-hiv,Concern for Risk and Possible contraction of HIV,"I was with a guy for one night only, We kissed and I think I tasted a bit of some blood, but I think it was my own blood as sometimes my gums cut. Because of this, none of us did any oral sex. Also we didn't have any condoms so there was NO penetration of ANY kind, so instead we masturbated each other off. We didn't ejaculate on each other (just the sheets) but I am concerned because I did shave earlier that day and cut myself a small bit on the base of my shaft. Also when we were masturbating each other he did switch from himself to me using the same hand but I don't recall feeling or seeing any pre-cum or fluids. (But I guess I can't be 100% certain). After we were done I was in his bathroom and found a bottle of Genvoya. my biggest concern is that if he did have pre-cum on his hand when he masturbated me and his hand went over one of the cuts from earlier that day could I contract the disease. I am really scared and all the doctors offices are closed today, your advice would greatly help.","Risk Factors , Possible Exposure , Treatment , Diagnosis"
