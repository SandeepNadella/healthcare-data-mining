Osteoarthritis,https://www.drugs.com/answers/friends-newbies-anyone-weird-side-effects-655170.html,"Hi friends and newbies, Is anyone having weird side effects from Gabapentin? Will this go away?","I'm whipped into a frenzy and feel as if I may spin off into orbit at any moment. I also am experiencing cognitive problems, my memory is so bad that family members have actually noticed that lovely side effect. (watched a film last night and my hubby said that it was the second time we watched it and I didn't recall it!)  I must 'hunt' for words which is really annoying, as I used to have a vast vocabulary. I now feel like a total eejit, which affects my self esteem.  (just had to sit here for an entire minute, probably, to hunt for the word ""annoying"".) That is a common word and I'm a bit upset about this. WILL this go away after continued use for a while, or am I stuck feeling stupid??? (some of my friends here may argue that I was quite the eejit even before doc upped the dose, funny, but true) OOps, almost forgot (no surprise there) that I am having terrible joint pain and insomnia. I could NOT sleep last night, so I took two benadryl just to get a few hours of sleep. I feel quite ridiculous, these problems, comparitively speaking, are of minor significance, in the grand scheme of things, but they are quite bothersome to me. Thank you in advance, to any and all responders, Lara "

I was put on topamax years ago and had severe, debilitating nausea. Moving a finger or eyeball would worsen nausea. I would pretty much (figuratively speaking) be paralyzed by how bad the nausea, loss of appetite was. Over 6 months to a year, i lost 25-30lbs, and i was 125 to begin with, 5'3"". My doctor begged me to continue taking it, as she was sure the side effects would subside leading to relief  And they did. I had significant releif and decrease in migraines/headaches for 3yrs or so. I was in between jobs beginning of 2017, without insurance and was not able to obtain my topamax refill. But I had been on it so long, i figured getting back on it would be no issue. WRONG! When i restarted low dose with intention of tapering back up, the nausea was WORSE. I tried to stick it out for a few days but it was unbearable. Zofran 8mg wouldnt touch it. So question is.. has anyone else experienced debilitating nausea as side effect, anything that helped it? I just got referred to a new neurologist and she wants to begin botox and prescribed Reglan to try for the nausea i get with migraines. I am seeing Trokendi XR, an extended release topamax, and wondering if anyone who experienced the severe nausea on topamax, has tried the XR form, and had less nausea? Topamax was the only thing that made a difference... and i even tried taking 7.5mg 1x day for a week, then 2x a day for a week, so on and so forth. The dose that had me stable was low, at 50mg twice a day. I just received an rx for reglan.. so im wondering if I could try to get back on topamax if reglan decreased nausea whereas zofran made NO difference. or if maybe a 4-7 day trial of Trokendi XR is worth a shot. Botox is my last shot... and benefit of improvement outweighs risk.. but if i dont have to, i dont want to. Please help with any pointers, experience, stories.. I am a nurse myself and stuck. This is beginning to negatively affect my ability to function efficiently in my job. Sorry for long post, just found this support group! Fingers crossed!!! Thank you, -Carley "

Opiate Dependence,https://www.drugs.com/answers/warning-about-suboxone-subutex-and-stadol-352742.html,"Warning about Suboxone, Subutex, and Stadol?","I've been on rather high levels of opiate pain medication for years. All are now prescribed by a legitimate Neurologist/Pain specialist, although in the past I've had a doctor with questionable morals, motives, and knowledge. Anyhow, I've always done my best to be very informed about these drugs, and since I've actually gotten off them a few times over the years, (trying to live without being a slave to medication, which didn't work) I've done a lot of research (especially after a recent episode) on Suboxone, and Subutex, which is the Bupenorphine just like Suboxone, but without the Naloxone, the ""blocker"". Well I once took a Subutex, (straight Bupenorphine) before coming off of the other drugs in my system (Fentanyl and Oxycodone). I was thrown into the worst withdrawl of my life, with insanely intense vomiting, diahrea, shaking, kicking, and cold sweats. I looked like I had been beat up, and had two black eyes when I was done because the vomitinig was so intense I burst all the blood vesels around my eyes, and on my face. I and nearly called 911 because I couldn't crawl to my car to drive to the ER. After doing my research I saw that Bupenorphine, and other drugs like it, like Butorphanol the active ingredient in Stadol, have such a strong binding affinity with the opiate receptors, that if you're still on high doses of other opiates, it will literally rip it off of the receptors, and block the receptors from recieving the drugs in your system, and as I mention, induce percipitated withdrawl. Moral of the story is, just because your opiate tolerance is high, it doesn't make all other opiates safe, in fact the WORST thing you could do is take SMALL doses of these other opiates, because they will replace and block whats already attached to your receptors, without giving you enough to supplement the required level to keep you out of withdrawl. In retrospect, had I taken more Subutex, I probably would have been OK, but at that moment, that was the last thing I was thinking I should do. So be careful, we all know what Suboxone can do if you take it too early, but Subutex can do it too, and so can Stadol! I had a similar experience with Stadol years ago, and just recently after this event with Bupenorphine did I realize what had happened to me. I had thought that maybe it had caused overdose since I was one high levels of other opiates, but that seemed unlikely, but was the only explanation I had for feeling so sick. Only now do I realize that was my first experience with rapidly induced withdrawl. Just be careful, and do research ON EVERYTHING before you take it, and make sure you consider all the variables of your own situation. Just because one drug worked for someone else, doesn't mean your situation is the same. I've seen too many people who have had Suboxone work for them, then reccomend someone else getting on it, WAY too soon. If you're not in withdrawl already before you get on it, it will send you there so quickly, and violently that you'll do ANYTHING to make it stop, and same goes for Subutex. That's my rant, I hope that maybe someone reads this, and it keeps them from making the same mistake I did. I wonder if anyone else here has already had a similar experience? "

Opiate Dependence,https://www.drugs.com/answers/is-it-common-for-suboxone-to-cause-side-effects-56225.html,Is it common for Suboxone to cause side effects that include severe abdominal cramping?,"I have been on and off suboxone for the last two years. The longest I took it was for two months. The first time the doctor put me on suboxone I stayed on it for two months. I experienced stomach problems including constipation and abdominal cramping and pain. Even after discontinuing it I had these symptoms. I never really put two and two together-- that the suboxone could be causing the stomach problems until recently. I seemed to always go back to using after being on suboxone for a while. Once i was using herion again my stomach issues would start to slowly dissapear over several weeks to a month. I began suboxone another time after this and continued taking it for 6 weeks. My stomach cramping and pain started again after being on it for 2 weeks (once i was past the opiate detox). They tapered me off suboxone and I was clean for about 7 months. Even after I quit taking the suboxone, I continued to have stomach problems for several months. At about 6 months clean (4 months after stopping suboxone), I slowly started to see a little improvement in the severity of my stomach and abdomen pain. The last time I was clean for 3 or 4 months (after using for close to 9 months to a year) I took the suboxone only to detox and I had stomach problems after a few days of suboxone. This time the stomach problems seemed to go away faster and only lasted a month or two after taking suboxone for a week. After about two months of being clean the pain and cramping seemed to become less and less. But i started using again and now i want to stop. I have taken suboxone to detox but only taken quaters to a half for a dose. But i keep relapsing and then detoxing- i even tapered my use to get off the herion instead of suboxone and found that i had no stomach issues when doing that (but only did that once). And the stomach pain hasn't come back yet so I am thinking it is related to taking suboxone. 8mg two times a day was my dose while on it. Now my doctor wants me back on suboxone and i need to stop using but i am scared i will go through the stomach pain and cramping again if i get on it- then i will end up relapsing for sure and have more stomach problems. Does anyone know if the suboxone could be causing my stomach pain and abdominal cramping? "

He has recently gotten off the drug and it has been almost 7 months since he has taken any. However, he is faced with horrible muscle spasms throughout the day and night and cannot get any relief. The doctors are constantly giving him new muscle relaxers and percocet and he has tried other options as well for relief (acupuncture, pot, herbal supplements, etc... ). NOTHING has helped to relive the symptoms entirely. He has finally resorted to taking one or two very small doses of methadone a week just to give himself a break from the spasms- so he can endure them the rest of the week. The doctors (possibly encouraged by Workman's Comp) have suggested this is not related to the methadone use. My question is if there are any other people out there with this same problem? Has other long-term methadone users experienced muscle spasms lasting up to or beyond a year? Also, if so, how were you treated? Did it work?! I sincerely want the best for him and would love any advice. He feels very much alone in this particular situation due to the length of time these symptoms have persisted. Thanks! "
Opiate Withdrawal,https://www.drugs.com/answers/is-cold-turkey-withdrawal-from-vicodin-physically-307777.html,Is cold turkey withdrawal from Vicodin physically dangerous?,"Greetings, I have been taking 2-4 Vicodin HP for the last three years. Doctor prescribed, never at work, but the pain due to arthritis and various surgeries’ is, well, a pain. For a variety of reasons, I have decided to stop the medication and re-asses the pain level. I did about a month of research prior to stopping the meds and used the Thomas recipe (without the prescription stuff). I stopped eight days ago and from what I have read about withdrawal consider myself fortunate as aside from a headache (which is now gone), one day of diarrhea, (fixed with Imodium) and very light insomnia and RLS, I feel great. God is good to me. So here is my (after the fact) question: Is cold turkey detox from Vicodin “physically” damaging? I’ve read all the relapse overdose stuff but I still have the Vicodin sitting on a shelf, I look at it every day and I just leave it sitting there. I have seen sites listing results from cold turkey ranging from psychosis to death….. Then I find they are selling a detox program so they have a dog in the fight to deter people from going cold turkey. I’m interested in your opinions. If possible, I would like medically substantiated (provide links if possible) research.

Opiate Withdrawal,https://www.drugs.com/answers/oxycontin-has-ruined-my-life-my-doctor-was-going-189359.html,OxyContin has ruined my life. My doctor was going to prescribe Methadone for my chronic pain issues,"... (inoperable osteoarthritis in both knees, complicated by earlier fractures and rods and pins in both femurs from a car accident in 1973). But he's getting me into a pain clinic in about a month and keeping me on the oxy. Doc says he doesn't know why I'm having withdrawals, even though he is taking me down from 240 mg. slowly. He's kept me at 200 mg. but says he's going to decrease it on my refill.  But I might not even be able to get to refill as I can't stand the withdrawals every day and every night and have taken more than I should, or earlier than every eight hours. Sorry to go on and on but if anyone has some helpful information, I know they'll need information.  I'm freaked out, needless to say, that I'm going to be in withdrawals, should I even be able to get a refill until the pain clinic will see me in about a month. I'm trying so hard to hang on and just push the edges when I get to panic attack zone. I'm only several pills short and have cut them to make them last as long as I can. But it's still a day or two short. I'm so confused now and the anxiety gets in the way of thinking straight. I was under the care of an addiction doctor (apparently not a good one as he put me on Suboxone after six year of tramadol began to cause mental disorientation and manic highs. But Suboxone made my mouth break out in sores and turn bright red and, to make more crude details to a minimum, he put me on 60 mg. of Oxicodone twice a day, reluctantly. Turns out he was ill with lung cancer and died four months later after increasing my dose to 240 mg. When my primary doc took over prescribing, he suggested that we switch to OxyCodone and wanted me to visit a pain clinic. Soon, the pain clinic I chose told him I was on an huge amount of medication that was very dangerous so he started tapering me. He dropped from 80/80/80mg. a day to 80/80/60 the first month, then to 80/60/60 mg. By then the discomfort from the reduction became withdrawals. I am an addict. I know without a doubt that I'm a full blown addict. I've talked to a treatment center but they use Suboxone and said they couldn't help me. I talked to the methadone clinic and they said they couldn't help me (because of the chronic pain part). I feel like I'm out of options and that an unthinkable ending is now thinkable. But I know many lives would be forever affected, especially my two grown children, and that it's the most selfish act. I know, I know, but please God, I pray so many times a day, show me a way so I can come home to You in your time, not mine. Twelve step meetings have taught me a lot but it's most AA and not NA that have meeting around here. Thank you for reading this. I forgot to add that I'm 63 and have Hep C and a bad thyroid (OK under treatment). Thank you for anyone with even a ""hang in there"" to say. God is watching us all and can do miracles, but it's not a great deal of help when I'm sick. I've been a little sick so long that I feel like there's no reserves left. And even though I know God is the answer (in my brain), my heart can't make the spiritual connection when I pray. But like Mother Theresa, who had a crisis of faith for most of her life, I believe. May God bless us all. Thank you God for this moment when I can sit here and and that I can write this. Kathy "

Money was missing all the time and in specific amounts. (Usually $60. I am in charge of our money) He always came up with excuses and I never really questioned it because I had no reason not to trust him. He had all the normal signs; tired at night, very quiet, sad all the time, not interested in doing things with his family (we have 2 children). I didn't know anything about oxy then, but after doing research it all makes sense. He told me he wanted to quit. I didn't get mad at him when I found out, I felt sorry for him. I held him and I said I would be here for him and what did I need to do to help him with this problem. He asked me to basically ride him. Ask him details about all of his purchases, never give him cash and call him out if I think something is up. He SAID he wanted to quit. Months have gone by and he hasn't been perfect. He has slipped up a few times, sometimes he tells me about, sometimes he still tries to lie about it. I tried to explain to him that the lying is more upsetting than him actually messing up and buying pills. We have done many things to help him. We changed his phone number, he no longer hangs out with the people that are involved (which I have no idea if he really is). I check our cell account daily and check the numbers he dials and I know which ones to look for. I have Fibromyalgia and Lupus. I have had to stop taking my pain medicine because he kept stealing them from me. I hurt everyday, all day because he has this addiction.  The other night he went to his friends house to work on his car. He came home and wasn't quite himself. I asked him if he was on anything and he got mad at me for asking. RED FLAG! When he gets defensive like that I know he is guilty. Finally about 3 hours later I got out of him that he was given two low dose vallium (spelling, I know). I got angry, mostly because of the lying AGAIN! He told me that since it wasn't percocet or oxy then it wasn't bad. Also he didn't pay for them. The next day (while we are still not on good terms) we sat down to talk when the kids were away. I told him, for the 7 millionth time, I can't help you unless you are honest with me. I also explained to him that I thought he feels he doesn't have a problem because he only messed up once a week or once every two weeks. (which is complete crap, but I have no proof). He's not trying to quit, it seems like since he has slowed down, he feels he has a grasp on it. Well, the conversation escalated into a fight. He told me that I treat him so horribly that I drive him to do drugs, to ""escape"" from his horrible reality. He also said he doesn't think he has a problem. He said some other nasty things and then went out with one of his friends. (I am not aware if this guy does pills or not, as far as i know he doesn't). He went out, got really drunk (this is rare, he goes out without me maybe 1 time evry 3 months or so, we are homebodies, always have been). He cleared out his phone log on his cell before he went to bed. So I checked the online call records. He called the 2 guys he gets pills from for 2 hours straight about every 20 minutes. GUESS WHAT HUSBAND YOU HAVE A PROBLEM! My question is, now what? I am thinking of asking him to leave (he can go live at his parents house, they are in Florida until the end of March). I want him to leave and come back only when he is going to be rational about his situation. Only when he is ready to quit. I'm scared, I love him so much, he is all I have. But he is destroying our family and me. I feel so weak and helpless. I thought our marriage was one of the good ones. The last-forever-kind. I don't want him to leave and never come back.

I took 8 strips (16mg) for the first 2 days, then 4 strips (8mg) for the next 2 days, went to 2 strips (4mg) for 2 days, then 1 strip (2mg)/2 days, 1/2 strip ((1mg)/2 days, then to 1/4 strip (.5mg)/2 days & then did a day off & a final 1/4 strip to complete the taper. 17 day total detox. Mild to no w/drawl. I took B6 vitamin, L-Lysine & wide spectrum vitamin in the morning. Over the counter sleep aide at night. Lots of fluids. If you're suffering w/pain ask your doctor about Sprix. Brand new non-narcotic pain reliever. It's a nasal spray that works instantly. If I can do this you can too! You have to really want to be off the meds & tolerate some discomfort, but it will work. Best of luck! "
Opiate Dependence,https://www.drugs.com/answers/is-there-a-pill-other-than-a-regime-of-suboxone-i-477155.html,Is there a pill other than a regime of suboxone? I want off all pills!?,"I've been addicted to perc's for bout 3 years now. Started @ the 5 milligram ones, to the teens and 30's and quite alot of them in a day. I don't want them anymore but cannot handle the withdraws. I get suboxone off the street to handle myself when don't have the other. A lesser of two evils I suppose. However, even now, mainly taking the subs more often than the perc's, I still have the same hardcore symptoms if I even try to go without taking part of a sub. I hate pills really, from coming from a family of this exact addiction I guess I thought u really didn't become dependant on them... just didn't want to stop. I was wrong and now dealing with the reality myself. My question boils down to this- is there a one time pill u can take (maybe for a week tops) that could and would totally rid u of having to take suboxone over an extended period of time? It's a vicious cycle I go through. If I can't find any sub's, I go back to perc's and the nightmare continues. I don't even want to take the sub's, but in order to function as a human, mother, wife, employee, part of society... I need to. Is there another way to just shake this monkey off my back with just one swift kick? Probably not for I've looked @ numerous sites already... but maybe this one might give me more hope??? Thanks "

Anyone else on this combo?,"I was on 60mg of Cymbalta and 5 mg of Abilify for major depression for many years. I am a 49 year old female and hated the weight gain from the Abilify. Many years ago I was on Lexapro and it did wonders for my major depression but it pooped out after about 14 months. I was also on Wellbutrin and can't for the life of me remember why I stopped taking it because it, too worked wonders for my major depression. Recently, someone told me about augmenting the Lexapro with the Wellbutrin and the combination is worthwhile. Since I am older and going through hormonal changes, even my gynecologist suggested this change so I spoke to my psychiatrist and we did the change. Its only been a week now as I weaned off the Cymbalta and am going on to the Lexapro on Wellbutrin (both generic). So, I am now on 10mg of Lexapro and 150 mg of Wellbutrin, going up to 300 mg of Wellbutrin. Is anyone else on this combination of Lexapro and Wellbutrin? How long before I should feel the effects of the 2 drugs together? This has been a tough week going through the changes of the drugs and I am going through a very tough time in life watching my mom suffering from a rare degenerative brain disease so that isn't helping my major depression!

Obesity,https://www.drugs.com/answers/levothyroxine-bad-3143208.html,Is levothyroxine really that bad?,"Hi, A week ago I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism after suffering ridiculous health issues for the last 18-24 months - tiredness, stress/anxiety, mental slowing, weight gain, stomach issues, constipation (if not the complete opposite!) constantly freezing cold, muscle aches and pains and generally just feeling miserable. I've fought my GP for blood tests throughout this time as they initially kept trying to tell me I was suffering depression and trying to get me on anti-depressants. I kept refusing because I know my body and I knew there was something else to it all. After finally getting bloods tested my TSH was 62.4 (VERY high!) and my thyroxine levels 4.8 (VERY low!) - hence immediate diagnosis and prescription of hypothydroidism and levothyroxine.  I've been prescribed 100mcg pills to start with a blood test scheduled for 8wks later to test again and work out next dosage stage from there. In the mean time I've been reading many online articles and sites about levothyroxine and it's affects on various people and I have to say I am now absolutely scared to death of being on this medication (but appreciate I cannot stop taking it as that would also be disastrous). I'm trying to give it time - I've only been on it 1 week and I am really not sure yet whether it's doing me good or not. Surely it's too soon to tell? Yet I have read reviews from people saying it caused them massive weight gain, nausea, headaches, major cramps and muscle pain, brain fog, terrible hair loss and fatigue worse than ever.  I would question whether those people are sure it's the levothyroxine causing all this? Have they given it enough time to regulate in their system? Is it not just the normal symptoms of under-active thyroid they are experiencing only now they are more aware of it and perhaps looking to blame it on the drug they are now taking? Is it that the levothyroxine is speeding your metabolism therefore your appetite is bigger and that's why weight gain happens? Are they eating carefully and managing exercise etc or just eating more? I just don't understand how a pill designed to replace a hormone your own body can't produce (which is supposed to help you) can really be so horrific to take? I appreciate there are listed side effects with levothyroxine including hair loss etc but all in all my GP tells me this should make me feel like a new woman. But all these reviews have me petrified it's going to make me worse and a long road of exploring alternatives might be ahead of me. Does anyone have anything good to say about vevothyroxine? :( "

Opiate Dependence,https://www.drugs.com/answers/second-day-into-suboxone-treatment-143148.html,Second day into Suboxone treatment?,"Hello, I'm day two into Suboxone treatment in an attempt to kick a moderate Hydrocodone habit. I'm working with an addiction specialist in whom I have a tremendous amount of faith. I debated heavily on whether and when to start Suboxone, and decided it was time when I couldn't sleep and was in the throes of sweats, chills and aching joints. In all honesty though, I never rated myself higher than an 11 on the COWS spreadsheet. After reading numerous accounts of Suboxone induction on this site and others, I decided to start with 1mg instead of 2mg as prescribed by my doctor. 1mg was sufficient to reduce my physical discomfort to zero for about 10 hours until my withdrawal symptoms returned. At that point, I took another 1mg and 0.5mg an hour later. This 2.5mg proved more than enough for my first 24 hours and beyond. I'm in contact with my doctor. He's suggesting a full 2mg to start each day, and another full 2mg every 3-4 hours if physical symptoms return, with a target of 6-8mg per day. Despite my respect for and faith in my doctor, this seems excessive to me considering my success which much less than that. My question to the Suboxone community: am I going to end up worse off if I don't start on a higher daily dose? I want off of Suboxone as soon as possible, but I don't want to end up with my previous pill habit either. From what I've read from Robert_325 and others, the less I start on, the sooner and easier it will be to taper off. I guess what I really want to know is if I should I listen to my body or to my doctor? Thanks in advance. "

I think there is a small amount of vicodin in the cocktail which makes the detox much easier and they do not let you leave on any opiates. I need to find out if this is a good place and I don't know how to do that. Their site looks real good and I spoke to someone who works there (most of the employees are recovering addicts that's why they understand and try to make your detox as easy as possible but you still have to do the work by going to NA, AA, therapy, yoga meetings everyday). I just wish I knew someone who went to this place. I can't do the cold turkey method. I just get too sick and too anxious. It's so terrible that I can't even describe how terrible it is and I only take 3 mgs of subutex a day. Today is my 45th b-day and my Mom is all worried about me going somewhere if we don't check it out, plus my Mom is very, very depressed and anxious since my Dad passed away a little over a year ago and I'm trying to help her too.

Opiate Dependence,https://www.drugs.com/answers/my-suboxone-withdrawal-diary-352728.html,My Suboxone Withdrawal Diary?,"Well, I have seen a few people post their experiences with sub w/d. I figured I would start my own. I've been on subs for a year. I decided to stop and took my last dose, or so I thought, on Xmas day. I got to day 5 and wound up taking some subs for the next 4 days. I did small doses, but the fact of the matter is I was weak and should have never had subs there to take. So now Im on day 2 again. I got rid of my subs, and Im ready to do this. I should add that this is not my first time quitting subs. I was on there for 2 years and quit cold turkey. I stayed off of them for a year then went right back on them. I have been clean from opiates this entire time. I never had a relapse... since March 2008. I dont know what possessed me to go back on the subs, especially since I wasnt even taking narcotics. But I did, and now here I am. So I will keep everyone posted on a daily basis and let you know how Im doing. Please feel free to email me if you want to talk. I know I will need support to get through this, and I hope I can offer support to someone else going through it.  Day 1 I didnt feel any different than usual. My anxiety level was a little high because I know what is in store for me. No w/d symptoms at all. Slept fine except for being up and down all night going to the bathroom. Something seems to happen to my bladder when I quit subs. Guess its just my body getting back to normal. I drank extra water too because I know thats good for w/d. So nothing major to report for day 1... but we all know about the half life. Day2 Im very tired today. I feel like I could go to sleep if I tried. No restless legs yet. I have that feeling in my gut... like there is a brick sitting there. Im sure you know what I mean. Anxiety is worst than yesterday. No chills yet, but I am very sensitive to the cold. Being outside was quite uncomfortable since its about 30 degrees. I ate a good breakfast and am drinking plenty of water. I just got done eating lunch and it doesnt seem to be agreeing with me. So there arent many w/d symptoms yet... but I dont kow what tonight will be like. Im trying SOOO hard to stay positive but its not very easy. The thing I dread the most is the insomnia. I dont have any type of meds to take to ease the symptoms, so Im doing this cold turkey with no help. I do have tylenol 3's but they havent helped me in the past. Im not regretting getting rid of the subs yet. Im ready to do this and I know I can do it. It helps alot that I have a wonderful husband that waits on me hand and foot... so I am lucky there. He also knows what its like to go through w/d, so hes very sympathetic. The most important thing is to have someone to talk to. Well, I will report again tomorrow and let you know how day 3 is going.

Opiate Dependence,https://www.drugs.com/answers/subutex-anyone-ideas-explain-anxiety-accompanies-540673.html,Subutex - Does anyone have ideas on trying to explain the anxiety that accompanies this drug?,"Well another new guy folks, just found this site (recommended to me by my counsoler) and have found it to be very helpful, Thank you in advance for any help you may be able to offer. I have just started taking subutex this week, been on it for three days. I was moderate/heavy abuser of oxys and hydros, for almost 15yrs. I have a pre-existing diagnosed anxiety condition. Several years ago I found that the pills got rid of my anxiety and gave me a great deal of pep... I was hooked instantly.  I have tried several ways to get clean and have opted for this avenue. I have been with the same girl for 4years; I was clean for the first 2 years and went back out about 18 months ago. My doctor is strictly above the board. My girlfriend is totally behind me going through this form of detox. She has been with me to see my counselor and my Sub Doc. In fact to be sure that I am taking the medication correctly she is giving me my dosages. She has seen me at my worst dope sickness, so understands my disproportionate anxiety that is associated with the withdrawal.  But what I am having trouble with is expressing to her this early out how anxious I get when getting ready to get my next dosage. She thinks a couple of hours between getting my meds is no big deal. Now I am sure in short time I will get my schedule set so that it is not as big of an issue but for now, how can I get her to relate to the stress taking that next dose cause just the unsettling feelings that start an hour or two before my next dose. She is (understandably so) of the opinion I am over just ""drug seeking” when I cannot pin her down on a time to pick up my next dose? I am not sure how it is for everyone else but, I start to get really anxious this early in waiting to get the next dose, the heavy dts are just so fresh I just want to be as far away from that feeling than I can. Still better than the alternative, I just want to know if anyone has any ideas of how I can get her to understand what it’s like. I may not be making any sense but she has been so good to me I just want her to know I am not trying to get the high just stay away from the crazy anxiety!! bcjjzs "

Opiate Dependence,https://www.drugs.com/answers/about-any-doctors-being-able-to-write-bupe-sub-465444.html,About any doctors being able to write bupe/Sub scripts?,"Hello Everyone, I felt like I just had to make a separate question/post about this. I mentioned it in 2 other places but this could be important to a lot of people. Especially folks who live where docs are scarce and Sub docs even more scarce. I have read where some people have to travel 50 miles or more to see a Sub doc.  I don't want to say any names, but someone on another board told me that ANY doctor who can prescribe narcotics can also write Suboxone or Subutex for pain. They can't prescribe it for addiction, but they can prescribe it for pain. She said they can even put refills on the script. This is news to me. She also said it is an off label use, but this is allowed. I think this woman is in a position to know because she works on a board that I believe is being run or funded by the company that makes Suboxone.  If this is true, it could be a very good thing for many people. Where I live some of these Sub docs charge an arm and a leg just to give you a Sub script. One doc I called charges $400 for the 1st visit and then $280 after that. I was told that if I kept going to him his fee would come down a little as time went on. Obviously I didn't go to him. Another Sub doc charges $100 per visit. This guy is also a General Internist and most of the people in his office weren't there for Sub. He further, accepts insurance for all his services, except for Sub. I didn't keep going to him neither. I called yet another and his quota of patients was full. Talk about a pain in the you know where. And now I hear any doc can write Sub or Bupe, if it's for pain. With me it is definitely for pain. Sure I'm opiate dependent at this point, but I came to be this way due to pain. Back in my party days, opiates were never my favorite things. I don't think I ever even took opiates with the intent of getting high and partying. I just don't like them all that much. I'd rather have some beers. So I take bupe for pain, and if any doc can legally write me these scripts, I really want to know?  Aren't some of you nurses or don't some of you work in the medical field? Maybe you folks can ask some docs that you know? I'd ask about Sublingual buprenorphine to start out, so they know what you're talking about. Then I'd ask about Suboxone. I mean what the heck. Many of us might be able to save over 100 a month if we can get scripts from our PCP docs. What you all think? "

They didn't give me energy or the other 'wonder pill' side effects others experienced.  I began taking Adipex in January 2010.

I was told by the Dr. I needed to take a DAILY water pill because my body was retaining the (fat converted to water) the pill was releasing. So, I started a daily water & potassium pill with my adipex dose. Before I started the medication, I wasn't eating much anyway. I had no appitie before the pills but when taking them, it became so bad that I would forget to eat somedays. I had to force myself to eat and drink the entire 4 months I was on them. I went back for the 2nd check up & had lost 4lbs of the water. Still a net gain of 4lbs. I was told at that appt I was one of the few who would have to work harder to get the weight off.  Has anyone ever heard of not loosing weight on Adipex? I have several friends on Adipex & they swear by it. After my experience, I was left thinking, ""What's the big deal?"" I decided two weeks ago to stop the pills and have my thyroid checked. I am hoping my metabolism is the problem and can be fixed with a thyroid medication. I'd like to hear from anyone who has GAINED weight on Adipex. I know there are many people who have had sucess, but what about those who are like me and didn't have the terrific results?

In the past year my doctor and I have discussed my weight, eating habbits, work routine, exercise, etc. I said my biggest thing was from noon to bedtime I'm constantly hungry! I feel I could eat a meal and an hour later I'm looking for more food. We discussed weight loss drugs and the new ones on the market. I had to see a nutritionist twice a month for 2 months BEFORE she would even prescribe me something. I did learn a lot about food, eating habits, fiber, protein, etc. and even lost some weight.  After that prescribed me the drug phentermine which is only approved for short term use. I tried it for 4 months with good success losing about 20 pounds. Unfortunately I had to go off the drug for serveal months as it's not for long term use. In that time I gained back 13 pounds. We tried it again after that for another 3 months with not much success.  After those 3 months we decided to try Contrave which I had good results with for several months but then the effects seemed to go away and again was hungry all day again. And here we are now...  phentermine is a ""stimulant"" and thought to reduce hunger. Contrave is suppose to work on the part of the brain that is your ""reward"" center and suppose to surpress appetite and cravings. Both seemed to work in the beginning but then lost thier effectiveness. Does my body just seem to reject the effectiveness of ""weight loss"" drugs after time? Thoughts on trying Belviq? Or does that work on the same part of the brain as Contrave? What about the Victoza? Heard that acts on the brain/stomach feeling full? Anybody that's tried different weight loss drugs or knows more? Any info, feedback or thoughts are appreciated. Thanks for your time!!! "

My Psychiatrist then lowered my dose from 300mg slow release plus 100mg instant release at night to 150mg slow release (tapering down to that) and 100mg instant at night. Despite buying multiple skirts and pants in an AU 8 about 4 months ago I have split open 2 skirts in the last week and can’t fit into half of my casual clothes outside of work. It’s really affecting my mood and I’ve cried again and again because I am unhappy with the way I feel in my body despite being within a healthy BMI. My psychiatrist also said a colleague of his swears that he has only noticed weight gain in patients on dosages of over 200mg total per day but is unwilling to lower my dose further at present as I’ve had to completely come off lithium as it caused me serious thyroid problems after 18 months of it working without any issue. I have started to take diet pills and shakes but I’m really down because I don’t know if it even is the Seroquel causing my weight gain or maybe it’s just because I’m now in my late 20's... and I won’t know for months because I can’t lower my dose yet. Do you guys have any advice or experiences with weight loss whilst still staying on Seroquel, or if I just need to wait for my body to change after the dosage already being lowered?

I am taking Contrave with Trintellix?,"Prior to Contrave, I've steadily gained weight over the past few years while exercising more and eating a better diet, which is very discouraging. My doctor specifically chose Contrave because he said it wouldn't interact with Trintellix, my current anti-depressant (since 2014). This has been my experience thus far - first month: no weight change; next 2+ months: dropped 24 pounds; last 2+ months: completely regained all weight lost. Throughout all, I've retained the same diet and exercise routine. Also, my panic attacks are becoming more frequent. Even general anxiety is worse. I can't prove it has anything to do with Contrave, but it's been the only change to my routine. Has anyone had long-term success with Contrave while on an anti-depressant? Has anyone experienced side-effects that couldn't be explained except for the addition of Contrave? I am probably going to go off it (it's also pretty expensive), but before I give up on it, curious to see if others stuck it out longer and found a better outcome in the long run.

During this time I have gained over 20kg (44lb) and cannot do anything without sweating profusely. It's really starting to get to me as excess weight and being drenched in sweat all the time doesn't do much for my self esteem. I also get the worst hangovers of all time. I have come to the point where I'm ready to stop taking it and all antidepressants completely.  I had a chat to my doctor about it and he wanted me to see my psychologist before he would help me begin that process which would involve more money and time. I had a long think and after reading many forums online about the intense withdrawals users have experienced, Cymbalta discontinuation syndrome and the best way that other users have tapered off the drug I decided to start the process myself. Cymbalta only comes in doses of 120mg, 60mg, 30mg and 20mg. I didn't want to have such large reductions in a dose while tapering.  First of all I made my husband aware of what I was doing so that if he noticed anything to worry about I'd head straight to the doctor. I then counted how many pellets there are in each tablet (60mg dose). I'm from Australia and buy the chemists generic brand. Each dose contained 570 pellets. I used tweezers and a black tea towel and put the pellets in groups of 10. I actually didn't mind this process because I knew it was the next step in getting off this freaking drug.  After considering other users' experiences with removing pellets to taper I decided to lower the dose 50 pellets at a time one week at a time. All going well this will work out to be approximately 12 weeks (3 months). I've been quite lucky with little side effects when changing from one antidepressant to another and changing doses so I'm really hoping this taper will be slow enough to have little withdrawal symptoms. If not it will be easy enough for me to slow down the tapering to what I can handle.  I have been on antidepressants long enough and feel as though I know my body and mind well enough to do this and my husband is also aware of what my ups and downs are like. I am on my third day of removing 50 pellets and I actually feel excited that I'm doing this.  In sharing my opinion I am not saying this is how tapering off Cymbalta should be done. I'm doing it this way as I feel as though it will work for me.  Has anyone else tapered off Cymbalta with the same or a similar method? What was the outcome? I'd love to hear it. I will also update everyone on my experience as I'm sure there are users out there who are curious or thinking of doing the same.  Thanks a lot Lee "

I will probably give this drug a try because I don't have much to lose and plan on tapering off the Xanax very slowly. Does anyone else have any experience switching from a benzo to Lyrica without horrible side effects? Like I said I plan on doing a very slow taper. Anyone with my same concerns or experience who has anything to offer me as far as advice it would be greatly appreciated :)

This has caused many problems with prescribing the right medication. I feel like i've been on everything. Anyway, I finally admitted to my psych that my depressive symptoms felt more severe than ever and that I was worried. I also admitted to myself that after trying to be off of medications for about 3 months, I need them. My doctor prescribed lexapro because from what I understand this is generally supposed to have less side effects. I have read a lot of great reviews that this has changed peoples lives and I am so hopeful that that can be me too. Im most concerned about weight gain, and this is because I'm getting married in 3 months. I'm already trying to lose weight and certainly can't afford to put any on. (god forbid i don't fit into my dress). Anyway, I'm wondering if a lot of people have experienced weight gain and if so, was it immediate? My doc said if it happens at all it won't be until 6 months or so after I start. If i gain some weight after my wedding (and I'm feeling happy!) then I think I can deal with it. But if I gain a bunch of weight before the wedding I'm afraid ill feel even worse. Hoping this makes sense and someone can provide some insight. Thanks and good luck to anyone who is struggling.

My Psychiatrist also said a colleague of his swears that he has only noticed weight gain in patients on dosages of over 200mg total per day but is unwilling to lower my dose further at present as I’ve had to completely come off lithium as it caused me serious thyroid problems after 18 months of it working without any issue.

Well now i am on week 4 and I have NO anxiety and my intrusive thoughts are completely gone but I feel spaced out and depressed. I have no feeling or motivation to study or live life.

I'm still awfully anxious and the side effects are coming back. But last night I took 15 mg. because I am too anxious, compulsive, and out of control.

Nothing worked, I only got worse, and gained huge amounts of weight due to an eating disorder, medications (Cymbalta was bad bad bad but my Dr. made me stay on it for 5 years). I finally gained footing with Wellbutrin, but it started to wear off after about 2 years. My new Dr. (fantastic... first thing she did was get a genetics test done, and the results were staggering and remarkable), she put me on Lamictal Lamotrigine. My anger / irritability mood swings went almost completely away, and little by little, we inched toward a diagnosis of Bipolar 2. I went back through years of emails and charted out everything I saw... hookups, breakups, massive shopping sprees, etc. and brought it to my Dr.  My type of Bipolar 2 is the type that is heavy on the depression, heavy on the anxiety, and deep problems with insomnia.  Though Prozac has been around forever, and Olanzipine too, the two put together in a formulation is almost made with my name stamped on it. The combo is the first-line treatment for my very specific issues, and can also be prescribed (if not for Bipolar) for treatment-resistant depression. It's perfect! Fantastic! I can't wait - maybe this will finally change my life, if my problem has been physiological after all. Then I read that basically everyone who takes it gains weight.

AND GAINED 30 POUNDS. How is this handled? Does weight just go on i.e. water weight? Or does a person's appetite go out of control? Do people just become ravenous, and not pay mind to the actual number of calories they're taking in? If a person used a calorie tracking software and stayed within boundaries, does that work? Or is this just a systemic ""you get fat, get used to it. You'll die young from a heart attack, but at least you won't be in full BP mode?"" Clearly I haven't started the med yet, and you're seeing a demonstration of the way my excessive worry presents itself. Sigh.

I had to switch drs because I lost my husbands insurance due to obamacare and they didn't take my new medicare plan. the lortabs don't always work anymore and was told at the old Dr that if the lortabs weren't working as well I could come every month for low dose percocets. I have a mentally retarded nonverbal autistic mentally retarded 21 year old son I take care of daily so I need good pain control. Please advise how I approach the new Dr. I no longer have a tens unit which helped but I only make 600.00 a month and pay my friend 170.00 a month to watch my son so I can work.I refuse t spend my work money on all copays.

Lighting storms in my head when I sleep. Why?,I have been taking 12-16 mgs of suboxone now prescribed to me daily for almost six months. While I am still an addict I replaced my opiate and upper addiction with suboxone and energy drinks. I consume upwards of 5-6 drinks daily coupled with my dose of suboxone. Initially when I started the suboxone treatment I had very vivid dreams which I later discovered was the result of sleep paralysis. The dreams were very intense but after several months eventually dissipated. Now I have noticed they are back again. Also as I doze off to sleep I have what I can only describe as a mild lighting storm in my head. I have had a more severe version of this happen when I was using meth several months prior. It was so intense it felt as if my brain was being electrocuted and I was almost fearful to fall asleep for fear of waking up. I now attend 12 step meetings and although I have slipped up once in the past seven months (three weeks prior) certainly want to get off of the suboxone and lead a healthy and sober life. I know I need to cut down on the energy drinks but am very curious as to why this has been happening and if there is any chance of serious healthy risks.

It was so bad, I just lay on the couch thinking I will probably die because even lifting my arm to change the tv channel hurt-the only time I forced myself to move was when I had to feed my pets or let them out. I ate whatever I could that didn't require any effort, like salami, cheese, frozen anything-mostly a lot of sugary foods. I would go to the store very rarely and with my neighbor so he could help me load up on supplies. I was just miserable. So, methadone helped somewhat, I only took a low dose. Then I got on savella with the meth and it was much better. So... my doc and I discussed finally coming off opiates and trying the savella alone without opiates after several months, that was our goal. He explained I would have to take the subutex for awhile. So I went on subutex and to tell you the truth I felt great. No pain to really speak of and my blood pressure was normal after many many years. Well, after being off work for a year due to my inability to move, I was let go. My first day back to work, I was not allowed in my office and I was given walking papers. I lost my med benefits and could not afford the subutex which I had taken for about 5 weeks 2x's a day. It was like 5 dollars a pill. So... my doc and I discussed that until I got another med coverage (no one will take me because of my fibromyalgia),through new employment which offered group benefits, I will go off sub and go back on opiate which is very cheap. I skipped methadone and opted for codeine 4, and I am feeling terrible pain. I am wondering how long sub stays in your system and blocks the opiates? I took the sub the last month of my recovery period before I went back to work and was fired. I quit taking the sub for a couple of days and began the Tylenol w codeine #4 and I have been taking the Tylenol for a week and a half with no relief. The only relief I feel is when I take my savella morning and night but just for a short while and not complete relief by any means. Still lots of pain though and my legs feel so weak, is that a side effect of being on opiates for years? I forced myself to take my dogs for a walk (we are all out of shape due to my inactive period) as we all need to build up some stamina. I have read some posts and I read that it can take up to 30 days to get out of my system, so maybe I would be better with some Motrin? I would appreciate any guidance for this matter "

I cannot get out of bed, my muscles do not work, my digestion is super sluggish, I have joint pain, am losing my hair in clumps, my nails are crumbling, and now six teeth that have never had a cavity and were healthy at my last dental visit two months ago crumbled while eating spinach. I do not eat candy, nor anything hard as I have Trigeminal Neuralgia and cannot chew well. Therefore, I do not use my teeth as tools. I cannot eat bagels because they are too hard and difficult to chew. I have been on a soft diet for 30 years. I do not grind, nor clench my teeth. My skin is very dry, and the callus buildup is incredible. Am itchy everywhere with no rash. Have weird random be sting sensations all over my body. I am freezing and then dying of the heat, like a hot flash, yet I am freezing cold. I am losing my hair in clumps, my thinking is so foggy - i feel like I am spaced out. I cannot function. My entire body hurts. I wake up with a swollen face, wrists, hands, ankles, feet and my stomach is so bloated I look 9 months pregnant. You can watch my belly grow. The swelling comes and goes. I have gained 60 pounds that will not budge. I used to be a mountain climber, but now I am completely bed ridden. I get dizzy and lose my balance very easily. I actually was doing better before I started levothyroxine, despite my TSH being a 39 when synthroid was started. It has been 14 months since starting this medication. My blood work keeps coming back with everything in the normal range, yet I am much much worse. I have revamped my diet cut out gluten and lactose and am eating a lot of fruits and veggies. HELP. How do I get a doctor to listen to me. I just want to feel well. My body is so physically depressed that I cannot keep going from doctor to doctor getting no where. My last doctor told me that I am severely hypothyroid, but my labs are normal so there is no change in my treatment. I am wondering if levothyroxine gives false readings on these tests? I have more symptoms now that I am t synthroid, than before I had any thyroid treatment. I cannot afford the natural medications, such as armour. "

Opiate Dependence,https://www.drugs.com/answers/suboxone-taper-with-xanax-355888.html,Suboxone Taper with Xanax?,"Hello, My name is Howie and I need some help. Two years ago I went through an extremely difficult time in my life and began having trouble sleeping. I have my own business that does not function without me so not sleeping and being able to work was unacceptable. People depend on me for a job. A friend has a prescription for Xanax and he said they helped him sleep so I gave it a try. Worked like magic, or so I thought. I loved how they made me feel. No stress, no worries and I slept. He also had an Oxycontin script, and since the Xanax worked so well I figured why not try it. That began a year and a half spiral. I started doing Oxycontin and Xanax in the evenings after work everyday. After a few months I started getting really agitated and angry after being awake for a few hours and decided to do some research on Xanax and figured out that i was probably going through withdrawal on a daily basis because of the drugs short half-life. I did not do enough research. I decided to stop the Xanax cold turkey. Big mistake I thought I was having a heart attack. I couldn't breath and I think I had a seizure. I almost called an ambulance but I didn't and I feel I am very lucky to not have died. I made it through but continued my oxy use. After a year of Oxy use I finally came to my senses and decided I did not want to be on these pills anymore and I tapered myself off the oxy. I relapsed a couple months later because i believed I had control over the drug because the taper went so easily. I was wrong and for the next few months used the drug more than ever. Christmas made me take a look at myself and I decided I couldn't go home to visit in this state. Time to stop. I was able to get my hands on (4) 8mg Suboxone. I researched throughly this time and came to the conclusion less is more with this drug and I should taper off quickly and try not to be on it for more than three weeks. Waited almost 36hrs until was extremely sick to take first sub dose. Day 1: Half a sub, 4mg. Can't believe how well this stuff works, within 20 mins I felt better and within a hour or so I felt amazing! Like I did years ago before taking anything. Not high, but normal, I couldn't believe it. Day 2: Decided, because less is more, to only take a quarter of the sub, 2mg. Worked well. decided to stay at 2mg a day for the next few days. Over the next couple weeks I tapered my self down to just a crumb a day. Now I started trying to extend the time between doses. Instead of every 24hrs I waited 36hrs. I did that for three doses and today I am at 42hrs without sub. I'm starting to freak out a little bit, I keep reading horror stories about trying to get off sub after being on it. I am right around the three week mark where a lot of people say its harder to get off. Did I taper too quickly? Should I try to jump off now or should I try to stay at 48hrs for a few doses? I have 12 doses (crumbs) left and about the same amount in powder form. (Too small to be crumbs) :) Help I don't know what to do from here or what to expect. I can not miss work. I feel very alone in this. No one knows what is happening with me and I've no one I can talk to about it. Also I read xanax can take the edge off and help with the withdrawls. (Thomas Recipie), but i need to know how long and often would be safe to take it I do not want to become addicted physically to it. "

Wel... after the third night of not sleeping a wink, I returned to the ER and the doctor on duty that night, who happened to be an old high school friend of mine, said that he would prescribe some Percodan. He told me off the record that it was illegal to prescribe an opiate for withdrawal symptoms (this was way before Subutex was available) so instead he prescribed them for the control of lingering post operative pain. He then told me (again off the record) how I should dose myself to taper off opiates with minimal withdrawals and it worked pretty well, He said if it didnt work adequately that I might have to consider the services of a methadone clinic. Fortunately, that wasn't necessary. I am hoping that the Dilaudid will do the same for Subutex withdrawal.

Want to get off -help?","I was sober for many years and I had a bad breakup with ex after 10 yrs together... I had terrible cravings so my psychiatrist said he would start me on Suboxone for these cravings. He said it doesn't make you high so you can still function normally, he said it was easy to stop. He started me on 24 mg a day for 3 years. I quess I had a negative side effect 2.5 months ago: I became terribly paranoid and my family intervened and put me in the hospital for severe paranoia and detox from suboxone. I was given a taper starting at 8 mgs x 2 days, 7 mg x 2 days and all the way to 1 mg for 2 days then stopped on the 11th day and discharged. I decided to go to treatment/rehab because my brain was not totally functioning when discharged and I felt it was the safest option. I went to treament and on my 4th day there I went into full blown active detox with all the withdrawal symptons. I spoke to the MD/psychiatrist at the treatment center and he saw I was in bad withdrawal so he decided to start me on another taper just like the one at detox. When I got to 1 mg I began to feel the same withdrawal symptons again and on day 3 of last dose I again feeling active severe withdrawal symptons again. I was told I needed to go back on a much longer taper for about 9 weeks. Starting with 8 mg/day x 1 week, then 7 mg/day x 1 week all the way down to 1/2 mg daily x 1 week and then stop medication.

Opiate Dependence,https://www.drugs.com/answers/why-do-i-get-sick-after-my-second-dose-of-suboxone-519804.html,Why do I get sick after my second dose of suboxone?,"I've been on suboxone/subutex now for 3 years. I've been trying to ween off of it for the past year. I feel sick on it and sicker without it but I usually feel good when I first wake up and take it (1mg.) and then I usually get tired about 4-5 hours later and need a nap and when I wake up I feel like I'm starting to withdrawal again (no matter what the dose) so I take another mg. and here I am feeling so nauseous and sweating. I think I need to go away for help but honestly I feel like the doctor's don't even understand how bad the withdrawal is. This never happened to me until last year around this time when I was put into the hospital for a cold turkey detox. I suffered for 11 days not even getting out of bed. They sent me home and expected me to attend a class everyday for depression and anxiety. I was the only one there going through detox. I could barely participate. I recently read that it takes about 8 weeks to start feeling better. Why didn't they tell me that in the hospital? They didn't know. The woman who was my room mate was taking 30-50 norco's per day for 5 years and they gave her some neurontin for her restless leg syndrome and I believe clonodine and she didn't feel very well but she was able to get out of bed and talk to people and she even left before me. I wish I knew how she was doing but I can't seem to get a hold of her. I honestly never had an opiate addiction. Yes, I liked hydrocodone and was given some when I had severe headaches and also took my Dad's script because he didn't like using them but I never abused them. I was having a lot of anxiety and depression and going to the same psychiatrist for years and when I told him that the hydrocodone made me feel better (normal), he said he finally figured out my problem. He said my opiate receptor's were not working correctly and he had just the thing. He said it was safe and not addicting and that I could take it for the rest of my life. My family was very upset when they read about it and begged me not to take it and I got off of it once after being on it for about 8 months. I just cut the pills in half every 3-4 days and I was fine. Now I'm in trouble because what they did to me in that hospital scared the pants off of me and I haven't been the same since. I don't know what to do anymore and I don't know anyone who feels like this except for some stories I've read online. Right now I am burning up and so nauseous. I can barely do anything. If someone in that hospital told me that it would be at least 8 weeks before I felt better and if they would have let me rest instead of sending me somewhere I didn't belong I may have made it but now the thought of going through that again. I just can't do it. I guess I'm weak. Suboxone has ruined my life. I can't feel anything, no joy, excitement, etc... I just dread everytime it's a b-day or holiday that I have to go to like tomorrow night we are having dinner at our daughter's for my husbands b-day. I'm so afraid I'm going to be sick. This is not me. I was always a people person and loved going out and loved excitement. I miss the old me even though she was depressed and had anxiety she was still participating and enjoying life. Has anyone ever felt like this or gone somewhere good that really helped them? Thank you. Larsy "

I just dont have the money to go so I want to kick this with my sister's help and then if I am able to afford this rehab go to it. I feel anxiety, sweats, nausea/vomit, bones ache, u name it its awful! Any advice. Thank u.  Jenn from California "

Opiate Dependence,https://www.drugs.com/answers/why-no-energy-with-subutex-486245.html,Why No Energy with Subutex?,"The generic Subutex that is. I just read a question by a person who uses Suboxone mainly for the energy boost. And many of you here have been honest enough to admit you also got an energy boost from Sub. And quite honestly when I was on the NB Subutex from 2005 - 2009 I always got an energy boost from Subutex too. Then I was taken off Sub and put on short acting opiates for a year and then I came back to Subutex. I then started with these generics. I was driven off 2 other boards for complaining that these generic Subutex don't give an energy boost. The people on those boards weren't as honest as you all are. They actually seemed afraid to admit they got an energy boost from Sub. I wasn't saying I only wanted it for the energy boost. But if that's 1 of the side effects that properly made Buprenorphine does, then I want it.  Now I'm going to be completely honest. NB Subutex used to give me an energy boost, help greatly with my depression, kept away most of my excessive anxiety, and I never ever wanted any other drug, not even a beer or a glass of wine. I didn't want to take anything that might effect how beautifully I felt with NB Subutex, and all I took was 5 mg a day. Now with the generics, I need Provigil almost daily to have energy. I take Wellbutrin again or I become depressed, and Wellbutrin also gives me some energy. I seem to need a Benzo 4 or 5 times a week for anxiety, which I don't have. So I live in a constant state of anxiety. Last but not least, I drink a few beers several times most weeks. I do that mostly for the anxiety, but it doesn't work because Sub blocks alcohol. So I ask myself, what good are these generic Subutex actually doing? And my answer is, I don't know. They keep me out of wds.  And now they have stopped making NB Subutex. At least we think so. For the past 5 months I've been trying to figure out a way to get back on NB Subutex and now it isn't going to exist anymore? My doc doesn't know. Btw, I don't take Suboxone because when I first went on Sub it was Suboxone and my feet, then ankles, and lower legs swelled like balloons and the docs didn't know what to do. So I'm afraid to take Suboxone again.  I'm just very frustrated. "

Advice?,"Well here it goes... sorry if this becomes quite long. I am a 27 year old female. I weigh about 100 lbs and am 5'1"" tall and am on a 20 vicodin/norco pill a day habit and I have to quit. I know the damage it is doing to my body and my depression... which is why I began taking the hydrocodone in the first place... has gotten 100x worse. During the times I am not on the drug I am a suicidal, crying, helpless mess who cannot do anything but writhe in self-pity and cry for God to strike me dead. I have tried over 30 different medications for depression/bipolar and anxiety, many having life threatening results, none working and the first time I took a vicodin I thought it was a miracle drug. It was for 2 years when I was successfully using it only during moments of severe depression or when I was having thoughts of suicide or self-harming. I was taking no more than about 6 a week for two years. I was finally able to hold down a job, go out in public, make friends, clean my house, go to school, get a degree, I was on top of the world. I could not do ANY of this before the hydrocodone. Well then my job became more than stressfull and a few of my girlfriends were taking the pills recreationally and so I began taking them just to ""feel good"" rather than when I really needed them. As a result I am now addicted. I have no health insurance and the cheapest rehab center here in the Dallas/Fort Worth area is $7500 cash up front which I don't have. I support my habit though friends giving me pills, doctors scripts and sometimes paying $5 a pill which is paid for with my weekly income. I do not have large amounts of cash sitting in the bank to pay for rehab or I would be there already. I am considering talking to a doctor about suboxone. When I mention this I get people from both ends giving me all sorts of reasons why I should or shouldn't take it. I do not drink nor have I ever been addicted to anything else in my life. I am at a point that if I don't stop now I will be dead before I'm 30. I can no longer work and cannot get out of bed in the mornings without taking 3 pills... then 3 more at 10am then 3 more at noon... etc. The risk of becoming addicted to the sub seems worth the risk to save my liver and my life. Is there anyone out there who has successfully overcome this addiction using suboxone? Since it is only administered in a doctors office what are the chances of me becoming addicted to it too? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I am new here and open to anything right now. Thanks :) "
Opiate Dependence,https://www.drugs.com/answers/going-through-suboxone-withdrawal-91771.html,Going through Suboxone Withdrawal?,"Hey All, Well I am new to the forum thing but I thought I would see if this helps at all! I have been reading posts constantly for the last few days... Here we go. So it's the same story you all know so well..pills, pills, and more pills that lead to emptiness. Then I began my Suboxone treatment at the time I was so scared of pain pill withdrawal I was willing to try ANYTHING I could afford! So after searching online I found a Sub doctor like 2 miles away from my house all signs seemed to point me in that direction so I started at 4 - 2mg a day and I felt pretty good. So I slowly decreased over a year with my doctor and honestly I didn't think I would go through withdrawal that bad... HOLY SH#T I was wrong. So when I was on 1 mg a day for like a month I stopped. That was 7 days ago. I found it so helpful to come on the computer and read what other people were going through and today I feel good enough to share my story with you guys and hopefully give comfort to someone thinking about stopping and what they should expect. So here is my day by day experience from withdrawal. Day 1. I am going to count this from the last dose I took which was a tiny crumb of a pill but I think our mental state has a lot to do with how we feel and when I took my last crumb I was so scared but I felt ok for the rest of the day. I mean I would think about it from time to time but no physical symptoms. Until I tried to go to bed. Haha. Yeah I tossed and turned all night. I took tylenol pm and trazadone and no sleep came. This brings us to day 2. Day 2. Ok the physical withdrawals have begun and they are still manageable. I feel tired and I can't stop yawning, sneezing and feeling off. But today I am still able to do things like get out of bed. I really don't have much of an appetite but since the bathroom issues have started I am ok with that. I was scared to go to bed, and as it turned out that was for good reason. I did not sleep more then 2 hours this night. I took 2mg of Lunesta and all that did was make me more sick to my stomach since it left a horrible taste in my mouth. I will never take that shit again. Here comes day 3. Day 3. HORRIBLE is really the only word that comes to mind. My husband had to go back to work today so that leaves me feeling like sh#t to take care of my 4 year old. God I love that kid, and I feel like such a horrible mother fir letting myself get here but that is another topic. Anyway today I can hardly stand up. I am in severe withdrawal mode. Sweating, tired but I can't sleep. My muscles are burning, and I can literally see the sweat coming off of my palms. Bathroom problems are in full swing so I tool 20mg of bentyl and that really helped with settling my stomach. The only other comfort I have found today is taking baths everytime my muscles start burning or I start to get the skin crawling feeling I take a bath. For as long and as hot as I can stand. THIS REALLY HELPED ME. I know some people have said that exercise is key in withdrawal but I am just not able to stand for more then 5 minutes at a time so I just can't. Sleep tonight was horrible again. I went from my couch to my bed to taking a bath. I took 2 tylenol pm and 2 muscle relaxers and I got about 4 hours of sleep. Day 4 & 5. I'll combine them because they are both pretty much the same. I am feeling SO tired. But better wait is that a light at the end of the dark tunnel... Ok so I am tired and still running to the bathroom. My skin hurts and my bones ache but I feel like I am starting to feel so many new emotions I can't control my crying and racing thoughts about shit I haven't thought about in YEARS. Old boyfriends, old jobs, I mean I would be crying at commercials, but on the same token I laughed today. I mean I laughed. I laughed so hard my stomach muscles felt it. I honestly can say I can't remember the last time I felt like that. So I have been taking 37.5 mg of Effexor once a day and I think that is helping with my emotions but they were bound to come out sooner or later right. We can only supress for so long. Today I had to take my son to school. I felt like zombie walking him into the building and I was 30 minutes late picking him up. I can say that was the low point for me. I guess I was so tired I confused his pick up time and I had to go and sign him out of aftercare and I felt so guilty that I was in tears on the way home. Tonight I am going to take 12.5 mg of Ambien CR. I really need this sleep and I can't look at my bed without getting scared. So tonight I actually slept. I mean I did toss and turn a bit ut I got at least 6 hours of straight sleep. I am still taking regular baths to help with my muscle aches but these 2 days were by far the worst of this. Sorry if that is discouraging to those of you out there thinking about doing this but there is something that is telling me to keep strong. Maybe it is looking at my beautiful boy and smiling at him and laughing with him. A laugh that is not brought on my vicadin or oxys. I am smiling at him because I want to smile. I keep telling him how much I love him and how important he is to me and Mommy PROMISES that when she feels better I AM GOING TO BE THE BEST MOTHER IN THE WORLD. Don't get me worng my son was never neglected but I am just going through a roller coaster of emotions. Day 6. Since I got some sleep last night I actually feel better today. Most of my withdrawals are manageable. The worst is the fatigue and bathroom problems. So I spend most of today making attmepts to get up and get things done around my house. Imagine if you will a 4 year old & a 36 year old man who are used to have ME a stay at home mom do everything from cooking to cleaning to laundry and homework and just about everything else under the son being out of commission for a week. Well needless to say my house is a mess. The dishes are piled up and it looks like my house threw up. So I made a strong effort to clean up a bit and I was able to. Ok I had to sit down every few minutes but I did it. I took my son to school went to Starbucks for a while and had some coffee. That wasn't the est idea for my stomach but hey you live and learn! So today over all I would say I am at about 60% back to normal just tired. That brings me to day 7 today. I took another ambien last night. I can't have another sleepless night it would kill me. But I woke up today and I feel really good. Still weak and tired but. No more sweating no more cramps. I feel hungry and I made a nice breakfast for my son (who is eating right now giving me a chance to type this out.) I think I may have made it past the worst. There is a light I see it I can feel it. I mean I woke up at like 6 in the morning but that's ok. I went to bed at 10 and I only remember waking up once to go potty! I really think today is the best so far. I am meeting a friend for lunch then I am going to go food shopping. Aaahhh the joys of being a stay at home mom! But I really feel like I can do this! I will keep posting and let you know how I am doing and if anyone has anything to share please do so. I would love to hear your thoughts and experiences. Just remember that it is hard to do but YOU CAN DO IT! Yes the withdrawal SUCKS but it is only temporary. I haven't been without pain pills or suboxone for the last 4 years. But today is my 7th day sober. Wow I made it a week. Tonight I plan on going to an n/a meeting and I have an appointment with a therapist next week. So I'll let you know how that goes also. Stay strong. "

Opiate Withdrawal,https://www.drugs.com/answers/over-sedation-at-the-beggining-of-methadone-474741.html,"Over sedation at the beggining of methadone treatment, is it normal?","My neice has just started on methadone to get off of oxycontin. It is day #17, she is at 105 mg of liquid methadone, that she takes everyday between 7am-10am. By 5 pm, the last 3 days, she falls 'asleep' in the middle of what ever she is doing, like eating, talking, or watching TV, but then a moment later she comes to. Yesterday though, she fell asleep on the couch at around 6pm, and no one could wake her up! She was actually snoring, my brother in law even tried to shake her, but she was out cold. Could she be on too high of a dose?? When on Oxycontin she was going thru a 90 pill prescription of 30mg in less that 3 days. Same with her 80 mg's, she would 'slam' a 60 pill prescription in 3-4 days. She did the same thing with a 60 pill presription of 30 mg morphine in 3-4 days. She then was buying off the streets as much vicodin and lortab she could find when she ran out, hoping to stop withdrawal. So she had a high tolerance to opiates. I completely understand that methadone is TOTALLY different than opioids and how it is absorbed when taken. From what I understand that is why the doctor increased her so quickly in 17 days from 50 mg's of methadone, to now 105 mg's of methadone. But here is a another problem. The last week or so, she also took 9 10 mg Valium (not presrcibed) along with Ativan she got from the ER, and also she was given Ultram 50 mg's, Zofran for nausea. At home she had a prescription of Phernergan (sp?) for nausea. The we found out she also took 9 Ambien pills (not prescribed) becasue she can't sleep. I looked up a lot of these drugs and see that a MAJOR interaction can come from Ultram, Valium, Phenergan, Zofran. I don't know if she will tell her Methadone doctor about all of this, highly doubtful. Now comes the last problem, and we are still trying to get the truth from her. Back in January she was pregnant and a doctor put her on Methadone, 5mg's twice a day. She sliped and told me she still had that prescription, 60 pills. I know how much denial she is in, and she probably thinks that a couple of 5mg methadone pills won't hurt her, abd then couple it all with the valium, ultram, etc etc, I think this may be why she is so sedated?? I am so scared she will go to sleep and not wake up!!! I know I gave a lot of info, so I guess I need to know is: is she too high dosed, or is it the valium and ultram etc, or could she be sneaking the methadone 5 mg's and that is why she is so out of it?? Please, an answer ASAP, she has her dose tomorrow at 7-10 am, and it could kill her?? I have been trying to call her, no answer, but she may be out with her boyfriend. I hope she will make it thru the night without problems, Thank you so muc for any and all help! Lisa "

Won't I have withdrawals bigtime?,"Since I last wrote, my dr had some action on his referral to a pain clinic and I went in for a first orientation meeting. He's keeping doses on all my meds the same (oxycontin, clonazapam, zolpidem). In the meantime and all along these last few months, there are huge anxiety increases which makes me feel withdrawals even more. I'm so afraid the pain clinic is going to take me off my medication and I'm so very tired of feeling sick each day as I wait for my next dose. I'm more afraid of the withdrawals. Does anyone know if pain clinics use other meds besides Suboxone to help withdrawal symptoms? The doctor who was treating my pain had me on that for a year but I developed serious side effects. I keep reading how the anxiety feeds this monster, the withdrawals, and I can even see if in myself. I will need something for pain (osteoarthritis in the knees and neck, neck now starting to really both me more). It's wonderful to have a place like this to just dump the stuff in my gut.

Also, I had to ask one girl to keep her own details of her similar experiences to a minimum; explained to her as kindly as I could that it made me feel worse. This can sure be a lonely and dark place--I struggle to get out every day, and to make sure I walk my dog several times a day. Struggle with things like grocery shopping, bank deposits, oil change on the car (today, I got lost!).  I mentioned before that I talked to the methadone clinic and they gave me the impression they wouldn't take me because of the chronic pain issues. It's a small clinic so I don't think they'll forget that, if I went there again. One member, mpvt, suggested I go back there and not mention it. My next pain clinic appt for evaluation isn't for ten days. Maybe waiting to see what the pain clinic recommends is not a bad idea. Thanks every one of you out there! "

Opiate Dependence,https://www.drugs.com/answers/has-anyone-gone-off-suboxone-or-subutex-and-then-436280.html,Has Anyone Gone Off Suboxone or Subutex and Then Needed To Take Pain Pills? What Happened?,"I want to hear from anyone who has had to do this? I have had to do this twice. The first time I had been on Suboxone 6 months when 1 morning my Gall Bladder ruptured. I had emergency surgery and then needed to be on MSContin 4 weeks while I healed. I then was on Subutex for the next 5 years. My doc then took me off Sub and put me on a combo of Oxycodone and MSContin. The problem is that both times I needed sky high doses to get pain killing effects. The second time keeping the constant withdrawal symptoms away was a bigger problem than killing the pain was. After 1 year I needed 300 mg a day of either Oxy or MSContin just to stay out of withdrawal. This is terrible. I was not warned this could happen when I was put on Sub. Had I known this, I probably would never have taken it. The fact is I am a chronic pain victim. I have been told by several top docs in their fields that I will have pain until I die. Unless some kind of new and almost miraculous new surgical techniques are invented, I will never be pain free. I am now back on Sub because it seems as if the withdrawal symptoms will never stop. The Sub also helps my pain so it doesn't matter, in that way. But suppose I again have pain that goes beyond what Sub can kill? Then what? Am I going to need 300 mg of Oxy again, or maybe even more? I think maybe yes.  Has anyone else experienced this? Please answer if you have. "
Opiate Dependence,https://www.drugs.com/answers/why-do-i-need-to-take-suboxone-subutex-twice-a-day-377334.html,Why do I need to take suboxone/subutex twice a day?,I've been taking 1 mg. of suboxone every morning about 9 am but by 3 or 4 pm notice that I feel like I'm running out of energy and getting very anxious so I have been taking 1/2 mg. of suboxone or sometimes a full mg. at around 3 or 4 pm. Do you think if I took 2 mgs. of suboxone in the morning that I wouldn't feel like this around 3 or 4. I don't like taking it so late in the afternoon because it affects my sleep then and I can't fall asleep until 3 or 4 am even with 50 mgs. of benadryl and 400 mgs of neurontin and sometimes even 1 mg of xanax. Does anyone else get wired from suboxone and have trouble sleeping if you take it too late during the day? My goal is to get off this stuff completely but I just can't do it. I've been trying since the middle of Oct. of last year and I just can't do it anymore. I want to get off this stuff so bad and would do anything but I can't keep suffering. I've had enough and just think I need a break for now and then I will try again. I don't think I could handle starting cold turkey again right now. I really messed myself up by staying on suboxone for 2 years. That was way too long and if I knew this was going to happen I would have never stayed on it so long. If I ever get off this stuff completely I will never touch it again. It's a great tool if used properly but my dr. and most dr.'s think it's ok to stay on it for long periods and my dr. thinks there should be no withdrawal when coming off of it. He's so wrong. Does anyone think that I'm not taking enough and that's why I'm having trouble sleeping? Does anyone else feel wired but good after taking it? I appreciate any advice. Thank you so much! Larsy1966 
Opiate Dependence,https://www.drugs.com/answers/answers-suboxone-and-home-drug-tests-172740.html,Answers: Suboxone and home drug tests?,"I tried to post replies to some people on this site and for some reason I do not have access. But I really want to share this information. When I was waiting to be tested and scared Suboxone would show up, I was frantically searching the Internet and there were so many conflicting opinions on the issue. It was maddening. The problem was that most people didn't seem to have first-hand experience. I now do.  If you're wondering if Suboxone shows up on a home drug test kit, then read on.  My husband made me take a drug test and I am taking Suboxone. It was the FirstCheck test, the one that tests for opiates and other prescription drugs. It was $40.  I was scared out of my mind that it was going to come up positive for opiates or even for something else but it did not. I won't talk specifics of my Suboxone use, but if anyone was going to test positive- if it was going to show up on the test- it would be me. It came up NEGATIVE!!  So the answer to the questions ""Does a home drug test kit test for Suboxone?"" and ""Does Suboxone show up as an opiate on a home drug test kit"" is NO, it does not.  This is my understanding of Suboxone and drug tests: Apparently the kits that can be purchased for home use do not test for Suboxone, nor do they detect Suboxone (that means that it won't show up as an opiate). The test that my doctor's office uses also does not detect Suboxone. But if you go somewhere to be tested, there is a really expensive test that can be run and THAT WILL detect Suboxone, though I don't know if it shows up as Suboxone specifically or if it just shows up as an opiate. I heard that this test costs about $300. Though that may be untrue. It's just what I heard. So if you are about to start a job, etc. and are being tested by a company, they may have access to a test that will detect Suboxone.  I can't explain any of this. I have no idea why one test will detect it and another will not since Suboxone is an opiate and an opiate antagonist. Maybe the detection level cutoffs have something to do with it? Certain tests are set to certain cutoff levels so that with some tests, usually the home tests, you can have a certain level of a drug in your system but it won't register. For example, you took opiates three days ago. By now most of the drug has passed through your system and you no longer have enough of it in your system for it to be detected by a home test kit because that test kit is ""programmed"" to give a ""negative"" result if the drug level is under a certain number. But let's say you go and have your blood tested and that test will show ANY amount of the drug in your system. Even though you took it a few days ago and most of it is out of your system and a home test kit would not detect it, your employer has opted to use a test that detects any and all amounts of drugs. Then, basically, you're screwed.  I also know that I shot some morphine at noon one day. I went to my doctor about four hours later. He did a drug test and it came back negative for all drugs. I had only done a tiny bit of morphine and for some reason after four hours it wasn't even enough to detect for the test that my doctor has. Strange, but true. "
Opiate Dependence,https://www.drugs.com/answers/i-was-just-curious-about-everybody-saying-151753.html,I was just curious about everybody saying Suboxone is alot stronger than Morphine?,"I take 8 mg of Suboxone daily, but it doesn't seem to help much w/ my back pain. So I was just wondering, is it really that strong and is it really that addictive? I have no plans for getting off the subs. I've been on it since 8-6-09 and my life is getting sooo much better. I didn't realize what a fog I had been in. To me, the best part of the Subs is that I never crave hydrocodone anymore. In fact, I never think about it anymore, which is a miracle. And since it has now been 5 months, I am amazed to find than I can actually do things and live a normal (lol) life w/o the hydro, which I never ever thought would be possible. So I guess what I'm trying to say is, my life was so F***** up while I was using and is so much better now, if I have to stay on it for the rest of my life, that will be ok. Luckily we have good insurance right now so my monthly script only costs me $40.00, which is cheap compared to what I spent on the other. I mean, my monthly 60 hydros from the doc cost $7.50, it was the high prices I had to pay for them on the street when I took up my others before the month was up. You guys know what I'm talking about. I could never make them last a month, they were usually gone in 6 days. I am lucky to be alive. All praises to God!!! But I was just wondering about it being so strong cos I never feel anything from it and sometimes I have taken a double dose just to see, I am still an addict you know, still working on not abusing my medication. But Suboxone has done wonders for me, so I don't have any plans to quit just yet. I know we are all different, this is just how I feel and how it works for me. Sorry so long. Best wishes and prayers to all. Laura "

I am on 30mg of bupenorphine and am stabalizing my dose to switch to subutex then suboxone in less then a month. i have been searching for answers to allergy tests for medication but have found none. Basically if I switch over and the medication causes an allergic reaction I would be force to go through severe rapid withdrawl, or use illegal drugs to be accepted back into a methadone program..neither option sounds very safe or smart at this point.

Want to know if L-trytophan may help me - it's been almost 2 months since I went from Opana's and my mind is JUST starting to work aqain.. barely - since I've stopped the 5HTP! I'm sorely lacking in serotonin and NO SSRI'S FOR ME; tried every 1; 2-3 times for anxiety and pain help - too many side effects and had to stop every one! Don't want St. John's Wort Either (read it can make U anxious-OR ANYTHING I HAVE TO TAPER OFF OF.)..Can't believe Endo gave me 5HTP w/no explanation; was so out of it I just got my blood work and left thinking it was another Omega type thing.. Anyway, would L-trytophan help me w/getting back up to ""normal""?? Finally thinking clearly; don't like feeling sedated - just want to be calm, and feel better without this feeling like I'M GOING TO EXPLODE - W/VERY LITTLE SLEEP after 55 hours...  Health Store recommended L-trytophan - Endo said it would be okay.. BUT WOULD I HAVE TO TAPER OFF THAT TOO? If YES, then I'll just stick to drinking gallons of herbal teas and not sleep for a couple weeks...  Only have 1 adrenal gland and Hashimoto's - where thyroid goes from LOW to HIGH - so Endo very concerned about STRESS! Weigh about 150 pounds; female-Health Food Store has Pharmaceutical grade L-trytophan in 500 mg capsules... THINK IT WOULD WORK? WOULD I HAVE TO TAPER? Sorry for the long winded story-wanted U to know background..MUCH THANKS AND HOPE I CAN HELP U SOME DAY... PASS IT ON... XO "

Doc has me on Ativan which helps a little, but I can only take a quarter of 1mg pill or I get very drowsy (at night I take 2).

I spend a lot of time researching everything remotely related to opiate addiction. Just a little tip for all of you, don’t believe everything you find on the web.

I'm not sure if you are only suppose to ask questions about medication or that require medication. But in hopes of some answers , I'll ask anyway. Let me know if this is the wrong place to be asking.  I have developed a very sore, painful right wrist over the course of about a month or so. It gradually got worse and worse and now it's near impossible to work with. It REALLY hurts when I grab my wrist and give it a slight squeeze. It doesn't hurt so much when I bend it but if i put pressure on it when it's bent it does hurt. But squeezing the wrist is the worst. A little background information: I am a fresh fruit cutter in produce at a grocery store. It is quite a large section of the store so I am cutting roughly 110 Large and Medium bowls of fruit a day, 4 days a week. Also sliced veggies, watermelon quarters and slices, ect. So as you can imagine My right wrist is getting a lot of exercise constantly. Our cutlery is less than efficicent for cutting fruit with such hard skins like watermelons and especially PINEAPPLE. I have to put lot of force behind the knife to get it into the skin to slice it. And when the knife his the fruit with all that force behind it, the knife being so dull, stops half way though and jars my wrist to a complete stop and does not cut all the way though, if that makes sense. I'm lomst positive that this is the cause of this. I've begged so many times for new cutlery, saying that it is a health hazard but nobody seems to care or have any answers but buy your own. Which I don't think it's fair. Especially since I did not ask for this fruit cutter job, they begged me to take it because the previous one quit. I guess I will have to end up doing it. But my point is, do you think it is sprained or fractured? I can still use it, I can still lift thing but the heavier they are they more pain it causes my wrist, I got a brace today because I couldn't take it anymore. I am hoping just a sprain because I don't think I can work in a full cast and I don't get any vacation or sick days :/ But nonetheless, I need to get it casted soon if you guys do think it sound like a fracture. Sorry for rambling, just wanted to give the full story so you could give an educated answer, Thanks guys "

In Sept. 2011 I had a severe shingles attack. It was a 4 to 6 inch band that extended from the center of my chest, under my right arm to the center of my back. My primary care physician said it was the worst case of shingles he has ever seen. Since then I have been suffering from chronic PHN pain. I have visited six different specialists including a dermatologist, two neurologists, two anesthesiologists, and an infectious disease pain management specialist. I have visited the Vanderbilt University Interventional Pain Center, Anesthesiology Pain Division; Duke University Medical Center, Pain and Palliative Care Clinic; and the Mayo Clinic Pikeville Medical Center. I have been prescribed fifteen different chronic neuropathic pain medications including antidepressants, anticonvulsants and opioid pain medications intended for the management of acute complex pain; all to no avail.  I also participated in a double blind pain management research study to determine if an investigational drug developed by Syntaxin Ltd, a UK company, in partnership with Allergan to relieve PHN pain is effective. I received 65 injections in the affected areas of pain. Although some experienced complete pain relief, I must have received a placebo because it didn’t work for me.  In a desperate attempt to find a cure for the relentless PHN pain I experience daily I decided to try the drug combo of anticonvulsant gabapentin and antidepressant nortriptyline. Dr. Ian Gilron, M.D., M.Sc., FRCP(C), a professor at Queen's School of Medicine and anesthesiologist at Kingston General Hospital in Ontario wrote “This trial shows that the combination of an antidepressant and an anticonvulsant drug seems to be superior to monotherapy for neuropathic pain,"". (Published in The Lancet, medical journal September 2009.) For the last 10 months I had been taking 800mg gabapentin three times a day with minimal side effects, i.e. drowsiness. To precisely replicate Dr. Gilron’s study, I weaned myself over a two week period to 400mg gabapentin three times a day. I maintained that level for two weeks before I started taking nortriptyline. My plan was to take 25mg nortriptyline once a day for two weeks before increasing it to 25mg twice a day.  After taking the first 25mg nortriptyline table with the gabapentin I started experiencing mild side effects including dizziness, light headedness, blurred vision, and dry mouth. I stuck it out for ten days when I had no choice but to stop taking the nortriptyline. The side effects became unbearable. The dizziness and light headedness became so severe I could hardly walk and fainted on two different occasions. I became extremely drowsy. I was sleeping 16 to 18 hours a day. The dry mouth resulted in an extremely bad sore throat. It got to a point where I had difficulty swallowing water. My blurred vision also got worse. I could hardly read a newspaper or my computer screen. It took about a week to get the nortriptyline out of my system and get rid of the horrible side effects I was experiencing from the combination of gabapentin and nortriptyline.  I am now back to where I started, i.e. 800mg gabapentin three times a day. I have good days and bad days. On a good day my pain level is typically in the 2 to 4 range. On bad days my pain level is in the 5 to 9 range. I think the gabapentin is helping me some; but it’s difficult to precisely saying how much.  I was wondering if anyone also experienced the extreme side effects from taking both gabapentin and nortriptyline as I did. Were you able to overcome it? If “yes” how "

Neuralgia,https://www.drugs.com/answers/i-didnt-know-i-was-considered-to-be-doctor-463809.html,"I didnt know I was considered to be ""doctor shopping""?","I had a bad accident about a year ago and herniated 2 disc in my lower back as well as did some nerve damage. I began seeing my neurologist for treatment and he was prescribing me lortab 10/500 as well as neurontin, and I started getting injection therapy.  In March I found out I was pregnant with my second child so of course I started seeing my OBGYN. I told him everything that was going on with my injury and was completely honest about my prescriptions and treatment and he gave me a release to continue being evaluated and treated for my pain and injury. Because the neurontin was deemed completely unsafe for my baby I was taken off of it and only given the lortab. Then at the end of August my OBGYN decided to take over prescribing my pain meds so he could better monitor it for the sake of my baby. He cut my strength to lortab 5/500 and gave me prescriptions that had 30 pills each. I was instructed to take them every 4-6 hours for pain which meant that a script only lasted about 10 days at the most.  Now, I still had refills from my prescriptions from my neurologist and I was ignorant and thought I should go ahead and fill them or lose them. I did not take any of them as they are stronger than what my OBGYN wants me to have. But now I have been filling prescriptions from two different doctors. 2 prescriptions from my neurologist and have filled 5 from my OBGYN, totaling 7 in the past 2months.  Here's where it gets more complicated.  I got a call from my OBGYN office about 6 weeks ago informing me that my OBGYN was no longer with the practice and another obgyn was taking over my care. I had assumed that my previous obgyn had documented everything that was going on with my case, in my charts and stuff, when in fact he didn't.  So I get a call from my pharmacy three days ago saying I have been filling way too many prescriptions and they have contacted both doctors about it. So my obgyn calls and says "" why didn't you tell us about the other doctor giving you meds?"" I had honestly thought the doctor would already know about my entire condition but like i said my prior obgyn didn't chart any of it.  Now I am waiting to go back to my obgyn next week to plead my case to him about the problems, and of course admit my ignorance because I did t know what I was doing was wrong. What should I expect? The nurse that called me from the obgyn office said it would be up to the doctor to contact the state about doctor shopping. What am I facing here? I understand that ignorance is no excuse however I had no idea about doctor shopping or anything of the sort. I am terrified I am going to lose my kids and end up in prison over being ignorant.

I hope I can contribute in some way. Right now, I have a question about an issue that is really concerning me.  I take oxycodone for chronic pain. My usage is relatively high, I take between 150-250 mg per dose 3 times a day. Recently, I developed pain around my spine area where the neck meets the back. The pain is the worst in the morning when I wake up. As soon as I take the oxycodone, however, the pain goes away. It goes away almost immediately and almost completely. As the medication wears off, the pain comes back. I also have a strange twinge in my shoulder blade area that began around the same time.  I know it sounds like I have an injury and the oxycodone is masking it. However, I am confident that this pain is associated with the medication. I have never had any pain in this area and I have not had any past or recent injuries to this area. Has anyone ever heard of oxycodone causing nerve damage? Anyone ever heard of this sort of thing happening? I am really concerned because I am not sure what to do, whether I should keep taking the medication or stop taking it immediately.

Neuralgia,https://www.drugs.com/answers/trigeminal-neuralgia-life-advice-3438909.html,Trigeminal neuralgia life advice please?,"Hi I’m new here. I’m 49 and have suffered from a long list of neurological issues over the past 30 years. Cluster headaches, migraines, tension headaches, trigeminal neuralgia and cervical dystonia. I think it’s mostly related. Everything except for the trigeminal neuralgia is either in remission or under control.  The trigeminal neuralgia started in 2008. It’s atypical trigeminal neuralgia on the right side, above my top rear molars. It’s on the same side the cluster headaches were on. I’ve been treated with tegretol, although I’ve also found Valium, Dilaudid, baclofen and especially medical marijuana to help.  The trigeminal neuralgia actually went away for a year or two after I started getting vitamin b12 shots, but it has come back with a vengeance. I feel like I’m tolerant to Tegretol, which is my worst nightmare. I don’t like the way it makes me feel to begin with, although I am happy it’s available. There have been times over the past several months where I’ve been taking 1200mg a day. I used to be an IT network and security specialist, but I can’t do that type of work on the Tegretolor with the pain. The cognitive effects of high doses of Tegretol kill me. I haven’t worked for almost 10 years.  I’ve also lost everything that comes with a chronic illness. I will never get married. I’m too unreliable. All but one of my closest friends from college and grad school will have nothing to do with me. My closest friend from college died, and no one called me. It’s as if I never existed in anyone’s life. I’ve also seen people who were not my equal get great jobs and get married while I couldn’t do any of that. It sucks as I’m sure you all know. It’s painful and a blow to the ego all in one.  I have a very generous and understanding family - Parents - who I had to move home with.  This is not how I thought my life would turn out. I went to good schools, worked hard, have two master’s degrees. Now they are useless due to employment gaps.  The main reason I’m here now is to ask what people like me do to pay their bills. For the first time in my life I’m about to give up with respect to ever working again. I’ve always been resilient and picked myself up again, whether it was from cluster headaches or other things. I’ve always had hope. But this is becoming too much, the pain and especially the loss of intellect due to Tegretol. Back to money, I feel like I’m impoverishing my family and I’m getting tired of asking for money. I’ve been against applying for SSI or disability but I don’t know what else to do. I don’t know who to ask for advice etc.  Is there anyone here who can please give me advice? I know there are websites to help people with this sort of thing, but I want to know what other people in my position have had to do.  Thanks, Clyde "

Yes, Gabapentin was prescribed for the nerve pain. Unfortunately without knowing of possible withdraw effect (doctor did not bother tell me) I have felt a bit lost and spaced out for the past few days with some anxiety also. I have also felt much stressed after the epidural injection procedure although not painful but all together I felt I had a bit of mental breakdown as I have been in pain since early august. Went to GP on Wednesday and I explained him everything and Doctor prescribed me with Duloxetine 60mg (1 at night)+ and a 14 days course of Diazepam (5mg 1 at night) which I took only once before going to bed for the first night where I woke up at 4am with almost an anxiety attack and light vision symptoms feeling almost drugged by hallucinogens. I called the doctor yesterday and with a very typical brief discussion he said stop taking Duloxetine and I asked if I could have taken Diazepam as I know it makes me feel calm and he approved but he cut the call very brief without answering me whether I should have taken any action for the Gabapentin withdraw effect and whether I should be careful when stopping taking Diazepam. I still feel a bit shaken, unfocused and like been in a drug abuse aftermath. After doing a bit of research on these drugs I know that my symptoms are expected but I still have been left with unanswered question as: 1. Should I still do something about the Gabapentin withdraw effect? 2. Am I still feeling like this because of the withdraw effect or was that single 60mg of Duloxetine that has screwed with my brain? (I have to say that up until I took the Duloxetine it wasn’t that bad) 3. Shell I continue to take this Diazepam or shell I think about stopping this early? And when I stop how do I do this?

Since it was aggressive, I had to have my rectum taken out through my abdomen, the cancer cut out and the rectum replaced. For healing time, I had to wear a temporary colostomy bag (which was the wost time in my life!!! ) and after 9wks, was re-attached. I am cancer free now but still suffer awful pain in my rectal area. I just had surgery b/c the scar tissue causes the rectal area to close up and makes it impossible to have bowel movements. During the procedure, my Dr. stapled my rectum open. I still have lots of pain (spasms..that feel like someone is stabbing me repeatedly in the rectum and intense throbbing). I have been taking Oxycodone for the pain but was just today prescribed Neurontin. The Dr. said it would help with all the spasms and should calm the nerves down. I was wondering if in your opinion, it should help? I have been going through this for 4yrs and I am really reaching my limit. The pain is soooo intense that it's hard (and b/c of the area..a little embarassing) to describe and for anyone to understand. It interfers with every aspect of my life so much that I am considering having a permanent colostomy put in.

Here is my background and experience with trigeminal neuralgia(still don't know if that is my diagnoses) and meds. Severe Intermittent left facial pain localizing in my both upper and lower jaws, gums, and teeth for the last 5 yrs. It was a sharp steady pain that would stay for days and then disappear for a month or two. Thought it was toothache so we played the guessing game to find the problem and had 4 teeth pulled over the 5 yr span but the same pain came back every time. 4 days ago I had the most extreme ""attack"" to date. The pain was so severe and off the charts. I gave It a 20 on the 1-10 chart. It felt like someone was stabbing me in the face over and over again. It spread from my jaw area to the entire left side of my face, my ear, my neck and the back of my head. But only on the left side like there is an invisible cut off line going down the middle of my face. I would have calm dull pain in my jaw area and then would have the ""attacks"" in waves every ten mins or so and the attacks would last any where between 30secs to 10 mins to an hour.  Went to urgent care and they referred me to a neurologist who ordered the MRI. I've been prescribed hydrocodone, prednisone, & gabapentin 300mg 3×day. I've learned the hard way not to take all 3 different meds at same as it made me vomit. When I started the slow increase of gabapentin it made me very tired. It's been 3 days on it and I'm at a full dose. I take them with every meal and after I took it at dinner today I feel like I am speeding. I literally feel like I'm running around the house like a crazy person that can't stop and my house has never been so clean. It is now 2am and I'm still going. I have checked the side effects of gabapentin and it only listed hyper activity in children. Am I having an unusual side affect or what? Do I need to be concerned? I don't mind it, the pain is gone and I like the energy... I just wish I didn't take it so close to bed time. I have noticed that I get very drowsy when I look at a computer screen or phone for a long period of time. My eyes start crossing and they won't stay open but as soon as u step away from it I go right back to speedy me again.

It is always a scary decision to make but during my visits he insisted that I should have better pain control and I strongly agreed! This change happened almost 3 weeks ago. So far the 2 changes he made was he took me off Opana ER 40 mg 2 times a day and put me on 37 mcg Fentanyl Trans Patch every 3 days (1 patch is 25 mcg and 1 patch is 12 mcg). The second change was he took me off Norco 10/325 1-2 tabs every 6 hours max of 8 a day and put me on Percocet 10/325 1 tab every 4 hours max of 6 a day.  He did say we may need to increase the patch a little in the future and he also said the Percocet should work much better than the Norco because it is 30% stronger. Oh and he also added Topamax 50 mg 3 times a day which he sais is for seizures and migraines but might help take off some weight I put on from my Lyrica and Steroids.  My questions are... Although he said we ""might"" need to increase the dose of Fentanyl a little in the future, it seems to be a great decrease to me? I tried a few conversion charts but I became confused converting from mg to mcg. Could someone convert for me... Daily dose of Opana ER 80 mg to Fentanyl? My pain level has not been under control for the last year and I feel I took a huge step backwards!  Next question... I went from being able to take 2 Norco's 10/325mg at a time every 6 hours to 1 Percocet 10/325mg every 4 hours. He told me it would be 30 % stronger but not when I only take 1 compared to 2 correct? Or am I missing something? I have bottles of Norco left over from a little here and a little there so I have taken a few during horrible pain or to try to get a little sleep which I plan to be honest and tell the PM Doc but I'm now starting to regret the switch!

My question is, I was told by my neurologists that the XR was a 12 hour med and the regular was a 8 hour type med. He explained it in more depth than that in that the XR reacts faster and stays at that level and stops after 12 hours. The regular tegretol gradually goes up and than starts going down over a 8 hour period. My primary physician changed this because of my blood check which has always been done.

Opiate Withdrawal,https://www.drugs.com/answers/follow-up-on-my-curious-lack-of-withdrawal-from-167137.html,Follow up on my curious lack of withdrawal from anything I have ever been on... why is that?,"So I have posted twice previously about this topic. Basically, I have never had any withdrawal symptoms when I discontinue the use of any drugs... even if I quit cold turkey. I had been taking methadone for a year and a half, but wanted to go off it, so I wondered if that would be problem-free too. I got a lot of responses from people telling me about how awful methadone withdrawal is and got really scared. But I just couldn't keep taking it anymore, because all the meds I have had to take for nerve damage killed my metabolism and made me gain a lot of weight.  So I had been taking 120mgs of methadone daily for a year and a half. After reading all of the posts and horror stories (and upon my doctors orders) I didn't want to quit it cold turkey like everything else. But I did want to go off it rapidly. So I weened myself off of it in a little less than a month. I went first from taking 120mgs down to 80 or 60mgs, then down to 40mgs, and then I went off it entirely after a week on 40mgs. To my surprise, I didn't have any withdrawal symptoms the entire time. I also kicked all of my opioids (morphine and oxycodone) for that time period too, because I wanted to get back down to a baseline. I still have horrific nerve damage, but I am happy to be off most of my meds. I just had a spinal cord stimulator implanted, so I am using that and self hypnosis/deep meditation daily to control my pain. It takes a lot of self discipline, but it is worth it because now I can really work to get my old body back. Anyways, back to the main topic and the actual question: Why does my body not go through withdrawal? Has anybody else out there experienced this? I'm not complaining... I just think it is odd. "

I don't have it yet but my doctor monitors me closely and I limit how much Reglan I take. You do not need to take it 4 times every day unless that is what it takes to control your symptoms. I find that with the Trazadone I usually only take Reglan at breakfast and bedtime unless I know I'm going to eat a heavy meal. I also have 10 other diagnoses but I won't go into that here since it doesn't apply. Try the Trazadone. It's cheap at WalMart or most other pharmacies because it is generic. It will make you sleepy so take just before bedtime. This is not a medication you can take before bedtime but at bedtime is best. It also has antidepressant properties

Got depo again in July and spotted the last month again. Switched in October to the Lutera pill (combo, same dose every week except last week which of course are the ""sugar pills"").  I was told by my ob-gyn that I could start my next pack early instead of taking the sugar pills to skip my period. I did that at the end of that pack (early November) and didn't spot at all.  For the last week (third week in new pill pack) I've been spotting so starting yesterday I decided to just take the sugar pills as suggested with the hope that I will just get my period and the spotting will stop after I start the next pack next week, because I have not been able to have sex since the spotting started. In this month's pill pack I have missed 2 pills total (a week apart) and took the 2 pills the next day to ""fix"" it.  I'm a little confused because I have not had a real period since April, just random spotting here and there and it's frustrating. As the spotting is almost nothing today (even though I'm on day 2 of the sugar pills), I'm wondering if it would be safe to have sex, even though my cycle is being so irregular and I have no idea what is going on.

If so, what dosage are you on, have you found that decreasing dosage has helped, have these symptoms decreased with time on the medication, and have you found anything that helps, other than of course headache tablets, tums, pepto, and the like? I'm trying to work out if the medication is the cause, and if so, if there's anything I can do to manage these side effects better. I've been on trazodone for about a month, at 150mg for both insomnia and anxiety. I started another med known to possibly cause these side effects at the same time, but I've paused that to try to figure out if it's likely to be the trazodone, and the headaches and queasiness persist. It's not every day for some reason, and the headaches have ranged from mild to lie-down-and-see-lightning-effects. The queasiness isn't full blown nausea most of the time, but fairly often it's a bit of a relief to just let it out (sorry to be graphic!) so there's been that.

Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,https://www.drugs.com/answers/weight-gain-mirena-2785406.html,Weight gain with Mirena?,"Hello, I am 32 years old and I'm scheduled to have a Mirena IUD inserted sometime in June. My periods were out of control as a teen, basically hemorrhaging every month, cycle was about 21 days and my period would last 7-9 days, extreme cramping and I would get so week to the point of passing out. My doc finally put me on the pill when I was 15 yrs, and I remained on the pill until I was 26. For that 11 years my period was still very present but normal. Then at 26 I started experiencing weird symptoms; migrains, hot flashes with nausea at night and unusual spotting in the middle of my cycle. Doc took me off the pill, which I would have done anyways since my husband and I wanted to start having children. My periods remained pretty much the same until I got pregnant a little over a year later. I've had 2 children since. My period started getting bad again after my first born, so my doc tried me on the pill again but I immediately started getting those weird side effects so she took me off right away and deemed me unable to take the birth control pill. My periods have been a friggin nightmare since my youngest daughter was born. So I am going the IUD route in the hopes that it will help at least a little bit! All this being said, I'm a little worried about one of the common side effects of an IUD: weight gain. I gained ALOT of weight with my first pregnancy. In the past two years, I worked really hard in losing the weight and getting in shape, and I've succeeded; I'm now at a very healthy weight, even 20lbs lighter than I was when I became pregnant with my first child. So you can understand my anxiety about getting the IUD and gaining weight without having any control over it. Can I get women's experiences with Mirena and whether or not weight gain was an issue? Thanks! "

Migraine Prevention,https://www.drugs.com/answers/weaning-amitriptyline-side-effects-3237490.html,Can weaning off of amitriptyline cause these side effects? and if so what should I do about it?,"Hi. I am a 19 year old female and I was previously on Amitriptyline (25mg) nightly for migraines and lexapro (5mg) every morning for anxiety. I was on amitriptyline a few years ago for a 3 years and came off it no problem. I was recently, about 9 months ago, put back on amitriptyline, but at a higher does (previously I was on 15 and stopped and then put back on it at 25). I contacted my doctor because within these 8-9 months I had gained roughly 40 pounds from this medicine and wanted to come off of it. While he did give me weaning instructions I am questioning if they were correct. He told me to take half of the 25 mg for two weeks and then come off of it. I am currently at the week 1 mark and am having symptoms such as severe lightheadedness and mild chest pain here and there. The lightheadedness was tolerable at first and gets worse everyday. I am beginning to question the lexapro as well because I too decided to come off of that about 2 weeks before I started coming off of the amitriptyline. Because I was on such a low dose of 5mg, my psychiatrist advised me to take one every other day for a few days and then stop. My question is could these symptoms be from either of these weaning processes and if so what should I do?

A neurologist from children deals with my migraines and a psychiatrist saw me for my brief period of anxiety. Thanks in advance for all of you help!

Migraine Prevention,https://www.drugs.com/answers/metoprolol-brand-names-generics-1405671.html,Metoprolol - Brand names vs generics?,"I'm on a lot of meds for arthritis, fibro, migraines etc and have noticed (even though docs and pharmacists tell you differently) there IS a difference with some generics vs brand names. Some generics did not work at all, weren't as strong or caused awful reactions/side effects. Some are fine that are prescribed for other health issues but for certain things.. brand name works best. I know there only has to be a certain amount of the drug in generics then the filler can be totally different so it does make a big difference. I noticed it most in my migraine med.  My question is.. my daughter is 12 and has SVT. She has pretty bad episodes fairly often and has for 7 years or so. She just now is being put on metoprolol 50mg 1x/day. I rather her start out at a lower dose to see how she does but my question is for people that take it have you noticed a difference in side effects being better/worse with a certain generic of this med or getting brand name? With reviews I think it's a big help to state (instead of just the common name of med) state whether it is brand name or what generic name.. then how it did for you. Only because I know one brand or generic could work great or have no side effects but another could be horrible... and it's suppose to be same medication. It could cause someone to not try it or be scared to take it if it has an awful review but it could be just with that certain brand. With a certain migraine generic it was all over internet what it was doing to people, how it wasn't working and how horrible it was affecting people yet the brand name med was a miracle for people. Which the brand name has been the only med to help me (yet the generic was a nightmare). So for months I never knew what I was going to get, got a different awful generic every single month and felt horrible and migraines weren't controlled.. so now doc writes for brand name only so I don't run into getting a bad generic. *So just curious as to if the negative side effects or reviews of metoprolol are with brand name or generics. If it is put in review if it is brand name or what generic instead of just common name of med that would be a big help to compare negative vs positive and to what brands. I do see when dose is increased above 25mg there are alot of complaints on side effects. Seems like 25mg once a day people seem to do fine.  Thank you! "

I started with 25 mgs./day and progressed weekly until i was at 100 mgs/day. At first when I felt it, I was sitting at the dinner table with my daughter and it felt like the floor, chair, and table (anywhere that a part of my body rested on) started to tremor/shake/vibrate as if we were having a small earthquake. But, I immediately realized it was only myself that was feeling it, because my daughter had no reaction one would have in an event of an earthquake. I asked her if she felt any shaking; while the tremors were still happening, and she said, no. I concluded it was just me, and carried on. It lasted about 10 maybe 15 minutes, and then went away. I take Topiramate 100mgs once/daily for migraines. I had my first migraine at the age of 5, if I can recall correctly. I believe I started getting them from an accident I had at the age of 4 or 5. I fell from the top of a hay loft, and landed on my face, breaking my nose, both wrists, and injuring my jaw, neck, and upper back. I am 33 now, and after living most my life with chronic migraines, and chronic pain in my jaw, neck, and upper back, and nothing ever helping much, let me just say that, Topiramate has been such a blessing! I didn't want to take a bunch of pain pills to live life, so I would take ibuprofen, and a muscle relaxer when the pain became unbearable, and Imitrex at the onset of a migraine, but majority of the time, it barely touched the pain. Also, I work in surgery, so the constant strain, and tension on my neck doesn't help, but, I love my job, and refuse to let this rule my life, so, taking something at the onset of a migraine wasn't always possible! Not a day went by that I didn't wake up in pain. But, the morning after my first dose of 25 mgs. of Topiramate, I woke up feeling... alive!! I didn't have neck pain, or upper back pain, I went the whole day without a sign of a headache, and to my surprise, my jaw pain is gone as well! The sun is shining in my life again! I have felt headaches starting to come on but they haven't been able to fully form. 2 months now, no pain, Praise God! I can finally live my life! I do get the tingles, but I have found taking wth an multivitamin helps with that, and the tremors, are bearable. I just am curious if anyone else experiences these tremor episodes? If you are contemplating on whether you should take Topiramate or not, I suggest to at least try it out, on a small dose at first, it may be the answer to all your painful migraines! I tried it, looking for migraine relief, and was relieved of more than I thought was ever possible with a medication! Please, consider responding, even a simple reaponse, or what your experience with Topiramate on this subject is greatly appreciated, I love learning, and taking suggestions.

It's way past time the shroud of mystery is taken off this medication, and unethical doctors, as well as non doctors, are stopped from abusing us poor patients to give us Buprenorphine or Suboxone.

It's also way past time that non needle using Heroin addicts are forced to take Suboxone, especially when Subutex generics are 1/3 the price. It's also past time that a lid be removed from preventing any generic company from producing Subutex. That's the 2nd mystery being concealed within the first mystery. I am saddened by how many of you think the Naloxone in Suboxone is there to help you. It is not, my friends. The Naloxone is there so that if a needle user injects Suboxone he/she will go into immediate and rather terrible withdrawal symptoms. That is the only reason the Naloxone is in that pill. Many people were also getting too much of the Naloxone into themselves by swallowing their Naloxone tainted saliva. That was why you were being told to spit your saliva out and not swallow it. The opiate in Suboxone is Buprenorphine, or Bupe. And Bupe is either very poorly absorbed in the digestive tract, or some docs say not at all. Bupe is rather absorbed quite well in the mouth. However, Naloxone is poorly absorbed in the mouth, and well absorbed in the digestive tract. Theoretically, there isn't enough Naloxone in Suboxone for you to feel, unless you inject it. But that's only a theory. In reality, many of us do feel it. So why do we have to take Suboxone if we were not needle users? Do they really think a pain person who never used a needle in his or her life, is going to suddenly start to use a needle to bang up Suboxone? Oh please, give me a break. A person in pain who is opiate dependant due to pain is NOT going to suddenly find a way to get illegal needles and inject Suboxone. Most folks wouldn't even know how. Face it, hitting a vein with a needle is not all that easy. It takes docs and nurses a long time to learn how, and some never get good at it. I've had nurses make a bloody mess out of me while trying to find a vein. So people aren't going to do this. So I say again, why are you being forced to take Suboxone when if you do get some of that Naloxone into you, it will cause you to feel wds, why? Because the so-called training the Sub docs go for doesn't teach them much at all. Instead of being taught something good, they are being brainwashed to believe that anyone who even wants Sub is a terrible hard core drug addict who is nothing but a liar and a thief. So they start by relieving you of much of your ill gotten gain. Why else are they allowed to charge over $500 for a first visit? Even the best specialists in the world, don't charge $500 for a 1st visit. Especially when the doc knows insurance won't cover his costs. But Sub docs do this, and why? Why also won't insurance cover them, or is it that they simply refuse to take insurance? I say all this needs to end. ASAP.  So I really hope any doc can now write Sub/Bupe. Comments? "

He hopes the Adderall (to focus at work) and Valium (to quell panic attacks and to sleep) will work for him to stay off opiates after he quits the sub, but in the past using this combination he has gone back to heroin... that is why he is on the sub now.

That only lasted a few days (the withdrawals were horrible) and I had never experienced opiate withdrawals before (except for some minor fatigue that would go away after a day or two) and I eventually started self medicating to treat the w/d's (taking benzo's such as xanax or taking other opiates such as hydro's or percs occassionally) Now if i go a day without an opiate or a benzo I feel like total crap and can't function AT ALL.

She is currently on Gabapentin, (300mg x 2 daily); sertraline (100 mg) and alprazolam (0.25 mg) daily. We think some of her confusion and unclear thinking might be due to excess medications. She has had some depression/anxiety problems in the past and complains of pain in her legs/ankles. We do not want her to suffer however are concerned about the effect of current medications on her cognitive function. The thought is that switching from sertraline(Zoloft) to Cymbalta or Lyrica and eliminating the gabapentin and alprazolam might benefit her osteoarthritis pain while still helping her depression/anxiety problems. If she discontinued the sertraline (Zoloft) without tapering off and immediately began taking a low dose of Cymbalta or Lyrica would this work without the side effects from discontinuing the sertraline? The gabapentin does not seem to help with her pain or restless leg syndrome problems but probably contributes to confusion after she takes it therefore I see no reason to keep taking it.

Osteoarthritis,https://www.drugs.com/answers/muscle-joint-bone-pain-fosamax-severe-debilitating-597394.html,"Can muscle, joint and bone pain with Fosamax be severe enough to be debilitating?","I was on Fosamax years ago for Osteopenia. Bone density exams showed improvement. After being on the drug for over five years studies came out suggesting that taking Fosamax for over five years was not a good idea. My GYN and I decided to take a break. A couple years after that I was struck with a nasty case of Sciatica. NOTHING helped. shots. pills. acupuncture. physical therapy. homeopathy (that demonstrates my desperation). For over a year and a half I was bedridden on powerful pain medication trying to keep up with raising my twins who are both neurologically and developmentally ""disabled"" (most of the work is navigating the system and fighting bureaucracies. These two people are amazingly bright, talented and have wonderful hearts. The problem is not they; it's... don't get me started). The fifth cortisone shot put me in the hospital--must have hit a nerve or done some other damage. No more cortisone shots for me! I found a different acupuncturist, excellent! She succeeded in eliminating the Sciatica. Somewhere during all this horrendous ordeal, another bone density exam showed deterioration resulting in osteoporosis, mostly the right femur neck. Went back on the Fosamax a bit before the acupuncturist vanquished the Sciatica. When the Sciatica was gone, I was ecstatic for a minute but realized I was still in horrible pain. Different pain. Lower back, hips, waist, spine... honestly I couldn't figure out what kind of pain it was. Bone? Muscle? Joint? All three? Unbearable. We were all stumped. Staggering around with a limp (more like Igor's drag step) screaming with pain when I changed positions in bed. Then there was a new page of information in the refill of my Fosamax. This one with print large enough to read without electron microscope. I doubt if the makers of Fosamax put that page in there voluntarily. It listed common side effects of Fosamax, and right there, #3 was muscle, joint and bone pain, no mention of severity. Further investigation revealed that the pain could indeed be severe. I dropped the Fosamax immediately and I am hoping, hoping that it's this vile drug that knocked me down, exhausted me and nearly wiped out my sense of humour (that would be the last thing to go). It's been a bit over a week now and I'm wondering how long it will take before some effect or lack of effect will make itself obvious. Does anyone know of similar circumstances and the results? Am I fooling myself to hope this might work? I can't live this way any more, but I'm scared to death of surgery. Any comments? Anyone? Please? "

I was fine until I got to 22mgs, but now I am having extreme stress and anxiety attacks. I have a lot of stress in my life anyways, but am finding it harder to deal with. It actually gets to the point where I cannot breathe and it becomes impossible to calm down. Right now I am smoking a little pot which is holding my sanity by a thread and is helping with some of the withdrawl symptoms. My hands shake all the time, my palms are always sweaty, i'm always cold, i haven't eaten in days, and I wake up at the crack of dawn. I feel like I did a line of coke! I saw a Reiki Master who specializes in herbs this past weekend who gave me an herbal mixture to drink everyday to help with my symptoms. I am trying to dive into this and believe it will work, but it's hard. I've tried walking, exercise ( the more I exercise now the sicker i get, so this is not an option), taking hott showers, yoga, deep breaths, valarian root, etc.. If anyone has any suggestions I haven't thought of, please let me know! Thanks! "

They are undermedicating me at this pain clinic and I don't know what to do. So, all I know to do is just to go through the withdrawal.  Also, I do have a steroid pack and I was thinking that it might help with the withdrawal. Does anyone out there have any idea if this with help me or can someone just give me your thoughts about it even if you don't really know? I would appreciate any answers.  I am so sick of going through this. I'm debating getting off this stuff. I either want to be properly medicated, or I don't want the meds at all. I can't deal with the anxiety of running out of meds every single day of my life. It is no way to live. It is ruining my life, but so is this chronic pain. So, which is the lesser of the two evils? The pain or the anxiety of running out of meds and having to go through withdrawal? I do have the option of getting on suboxone, but am scared to get on that. Anybody have any advice on all of this... encouraging words?  Thanks.  Love, Lillypurp "

I’ve had a kind of low grade queasiness on and off most of that time, and I’ve needed to vomit more than a few times. Haven’t drunk alcohol at all, not a drop, so I’m considering other sources: food and personal care products. I was very worried about alcohol in these areas at first, so I ordered a lot of alcohol free items: deodorant, toothpaste, mouthwash, cologne, facial cleanser, moisturizer... I think I went a bit overboard, and have since learned that lots of things labeled ‘alcohol’ in such products are not ethyl alcohol, but rather some kind of fatty alcohol molecule, not what gets you drunk or sick on Antabuse. But a lot of these products, and medicines and syrups, do have ethyl alcohol, so I’m still being really careful. And something is making me sick. Has anyone had a reaction to alcohol in personal care products?  Food products seem trickier. I really like kimchi and other fermented foods like sauerkraut. I’m being cautious with those, and also vinegar. But I do eat a bit of kimchi, maybe sriracha or gochujang (fermented red pepper paste), rice vinegar in sushi rice, a lot of soy sauce... (No, I’m not Asian, but I love Asian food.) I use ‘sugar alcohols’ (xylitol, erythritol, sorbitol... ) in some foods, and have read that they’re all in the ‘not ethyl alcohol’ category, but something is doing this. What sort of experiences with dietary issues have you had? Have you dealt with any of this stuff? I’m of course asking my doctor, but would love to hear from others on the medication. Thanks! "

Couldn't keep water or food down for 2.5 days. Thought it was just the stomach flu but on day 3 went into my primary care physician in case there was something he could give me.  He wanted to get to a better diagnosis so he took some blood. Blood results came back with elevated ""alkaline something"" which he said could be gallbladder, so they ordered an upper abdominal ultrasound and I'm waiting on the results.  On day 5 I started to feel a little better, no more vomiting, although I'm still nauseous, still have the yellow diarrhea, and no fever in the mornings but fever starts going back up in afternoon/evening. It hasn't gotten above 101.2 though in past few days.  Crazy bad indigestion and heartburn after anything I eat, and I'm pretty much sticking to the BRAT diet.

Opiate Dependence,https://www.drugs.com/answers/opiate-dependence-i-am-going-through-fentanyl-95672.html,Opiate Dependence - I am going through fentanyl withdrawals..how long is this going to take? I?,"... was taking 50 mcg transmodermal patch. It didn't seem to be working and was just upped from 25 mcg two weeks prior. I was put on fentanyl because of the side effects of kadian (morphine). I was constantly vomitting and could not get my bowels under control though it worked great for the pain. I have been on fentanyl 50 mcg for a month. I don't like it. I sleep ALL the time and within 4 hours of forgetting to change a patch, I would start getting the shakes. My husband called his mother whom works in a crisis center a few counties away and she told him that I needed to go off of it cold turkey and there is NO other way. I know she's not a medical doctor, but my pain clinic doctor refuses to see me or talk to me. I'm very upset over this and am in the process of being referred to a new pain clinic for a new doctor, but that takes time. I put myself in the hands of my husband and he has had me under house arrest for 5 days now. I really appreciate him being here for me but he has no idea what I'm going through and is treating me like a child. The first day really only consisted of mild shakes and nausia. The next three days all I can remember is constantly rocking and my limbs flailing out of control, sweating profusely and screaming. I slept a whole 20 minutes throughout those 3 days. I thought I was through it. I don't have the shakes or the jerking vision, but my shoulders ache (and they aren't the problem), the pain in my back is returning (which is the problem), and I can't sleep! My body is exhausted but my brain won't shut off! Now, my husband got me cough syrup, sleepytime tea, tylenol PM and a multivitamin. I've been drinking nothing but uncaffinated tea and water, no sugar. I've barely been eating. After the first day, I couldn't stop screaming and crying so my husband gave in and managed to find me some dope (though it's not been used in our home in over 10 years). It helped a little, but just enough to have me staring off into the distance. I haven't smoked in 11 years and I smoked two joints on day 4 to try to get to sleep. Now, I don't know if it's the withdrawal symptoms or me, but the pot actually WOKE me up! Sure, it numbed some of my pain, but I was more awake than ever! Last night my husband fell asleep and I snuck off and found my bottle of Xanax. It's perscribed to me to take as needed for anxiety attacks. I took my normal dosage for an anxiety attack and I FINALLY SLEPT for 7 hours! But now I feel incredibly guilty! My shrink has me on Xanax, Cymbalta and Celexa. I quit taking the Cymbalta months ago. I use the Xanax maybe once a month if needed and take Celexa 3 times a day. I just started retaking my celexa yesterday. I've been reading the threads and there are mixed results on Xanax being a help or a hinder. Granted, I didn't smoke any pot yesterday, I took the Xanax instead and slept great, but I still feel the same today as I did yesterday before I took it. I know the methadone program takes 21 days. I have chronic pain which means eventually I'm going to have to find some kind of medication I can take on a long term regimen.  I am on the outs with my doctor. I think she put me on Fentanyl because she thought I was going to magically get better with all the crap she's put me through. I have always done as she instructed, as she instructed, even if I didn't agree, but now that she's shut me out, I'm very angry! Until I get my new doctor, I'm going to have to just suffer with the constant pain, which I could do before I got to this quack, but it's been over 2 years. I'm afraid to take anything without talking to a doctor first... I started on valium and vicodin, then moved up to oxycodone and valium and then morphine and now fentanyl.  Please, somebody tell me how long this constant rocking and aching is going to last... and how restless am I going to become? I can't remember ever being so AWAKE in my life! "

(i was just diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my back and knees thats why i have these meds)... xanax for anxiety... only used as prescribed from my psychiatrist who knows about the suboxone. my advice to give is to NOT do this during the week before finals like i did hahaha and do not do it when a big holiday is coming up for work because i am freaking out that the rest of the week i wont be better yet. i was not on suboxone for long... but it was still in my body (and still might be). i suppose if you were on suboxone longer, then the exact feelings i had will be more intense on the same days if you cold turkey it up like i did. i did the cold turkey because i knew i wouldnt be able to taper off because i had tried... i had to do it that way. i still have a script of suboxone for just in case... but i have no will to take it... the bottom of my tongue was destroyed. this is my third time getting off of a drug--first anti-depressants, then benzo withdrawals, now this... anybody can do it i have faith... all you need is support, to sweat sweat sweat sweat sweat!!! stay hydrated, drink antioxidants, and personally... dont talk to anybody who will fight with you during this... its not worth it. oh and dont kick holes in your walls. i really hope this helped anybody who is trying to get off this drug... yes woohoo it gest people off heroin... its not methadone... but its still an OPIATE... so by taking this... are you really clean??? think about it...  im here to give anybody support. id rather be in pain than anybody else so please feel free to comment.

On the other hand, I would like to use an anxiolytic that isn't a benzodiazepine.  How likely is it that Vistaril would cause someone to loose their lunch in a particularly violent and unpleasant manner? Would taking it with a meal reduce that risk, or would it only make things worse if it made me sick? If I took it and got sick, how long would it take before I feel better?  Thanks! "

Obesity,https://www.drugs.com/answers/prozac-weight-gain-3432147.html,Help! Prozac & weight gain?,"Please tell me there’s a light at the end of this tunnel. I started taking Prozac 3 years ago and have subsequently gained 60 pounds. I eat well and exercise regularly. Always have. Before Prozac, I never, ever struggled with my weight.  I have been under the impression that Prozac was a weight neutral drug that sometimes causes weight loss. Many of the stories I’ve read about people gaining on Prozac indicated that people over ate and made poor food choices. This has not been the case for me so I have been searching for other possible causes of my rapid weight gain. I’ve had my thyroid values tested several times. All good. I have tightened up my already balanced diet and I’ve increased the amount of exercise I get weekly. I work harder and eat better than I did 60 pounds ago. I feel like I’m stuck in a nightmare. And I’m at the point where the only possible explanation for my weight gain is the Prozac.  I have been off of Prozac for one month and am now on Wellbutrin. I’ve not lost a pound. It feels as though my metabolism is broken.  For those of you who can relate, how long did it take you to lose the weight you gained on Prozac?  I never in my wildest dreams thought I’d have cosmetic surgery, at least at the age of 38. But, I am so uncomfortable. Next month I’m having a tummy tuck. I look pregnant. True story. Hard decision to make because, well, surgery is scary. I am desperate to feel good in my body again. For me, Prozac was so not worth it.  If you’ve been through this and have any advice or feedback, I’d so appreciate hearing from you. "

Do I need to increase dose or is it the wrong med?,"Just some background: I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder (mainly social anxiety, moderate ocd) my freshman year in college and was put on Lexapro 20mg for about a year. It worked somewhat well but made me very lethargic and I always wondered if a different medication would be better. So I was put on Prozac 20mg for about 6 months, and then 40mg (which ended up being to much to I went down to 30mg), it worked well for me probably better than Lexapro, I had more energy and almost no anxiety, but then my increased dose came with some side effects. I felt numb, emotionless, lots of brain fog, very out of it, zombie-ish, somewhat dumber even. I also became lethargic again and my libido was almost nonexistent. But being reducing the dose didn't seem to change much. Then my doctor put me on Effexor XR 32.5mg after I tapered off Prozac. which I took for about 3 weeks than went up to 75mg which I've been on for about 2 and a half weeks. My anxiety resurfaced as the Prozac was leaving my system, yet on the Effexor I hardly noticed a single side effect (except maybe occasional headache or trouble sleeping). Anyways starting the 2 weeks after I made the switch I've been feeling very anxious and tense. I've had low energy/drive, have been over-worrying, feeling very socially anxious, irritable, panicky, not wanting to talk to people, and lacking interest and most things. I've also noticed my ocd has resurfaced as well: constantly over-thinking things, obsessing over insignificant things, intrusive thoughts, etc.  Do I give it more time or ask to increase my dose? I also ALWAYS obsess over the medication I'm on, and nit-pick all of its pros and cons and constantly questioning whether its the right (or even the perfect) medication for me and all my symptoms. I keep obsessing over finding the 'perfect' medication (which probably doesn't exist). I wish I could stop thinking about my anxiety and medication day-to-day, I wish I could find a medication and then just forget about it and just live. So tired of over-analyzing it. I'm not in therapy, I've only been to psychiatrists, so I'm considering that as well. Lastly I've also been taking Dexedrine (they don't have Adderall in Australia where I'm currently abroad. I take 5-10mg about 3-4 days a week and figure that might be contributing to my anxiety. I've also been taking Xanax (which I'm not prescribed) 1-2mg randomly when I've been anxious.  Sorry lot of info, any info/thoughts/advice on my anxiety and my experience with Effexor would be much appreciated!

It started out with the inability to fall asleep and as the worry about not sleeping grew and I continued to search/disect every piece of information to ""heal"" myself, the concept of sleep became so foreign to me, I actually have a irrational, strong fear of falling asleep. I constantly think and worry about sleep - all through the day, leading up to the next night. In bed my mind often fights my body's natural falling asleep process - it's terrible and results up for hours. I can say the fear is irrational - but its like my mind is protecting me from falling asleep. My thoughts are compulsive and they ruminate. I am doing CBT, but there is not so much negative self-talk it's difficult to stop the thoughts or restructure them... I am currently taking fluexotine and ativan as needed for anxiety.

As you can imagine, this has resulted in me not moving on that much with my life..  I stopped the Paxil (2mths ago) and my fatigue left me, however the anxiety returned! My Dr prescribed Setraline (Zoloft) 50mg, stating it is a less sedating drug than Paxil.  I am now on day 12 for anxiety, depression & agoraphobia. At the moment my anxiety is higher than it was before I began taking Setraline and I am sleeping allll day long (if that makes sense??? ).   I’m VERY panicked this medicine will not work for me!

I need input on sedating SSRI'S?,"I have been on Zoloft for 30 days now and my original psychiatrist wanted me on Paxil and I never took it and didn't go back because I lost my insurance (that was last year)... well, I ended up picking a new med this year ""Zoloft"" since I read what it helps and figured it would work for me, so I went to another free psychiatrist and asked him to put me on that... that psychiatrist did not have any info on my evaluations from my original psychiatrist and just gave me Zoloft and never really cared to find out about my conditions or listen to my updates or problems I was experiencing with the severe side effects.  In fact; he said it was all in my head even though the emergency room and my general doctor could clearly see it was not just in my head!! Guess that what you get for “Free Psychiatry”. At any rate, I have been experiencing so much trouble with Zoloft but thought it would get better and since I have never been on an ssri before I figured maybe I am just being a wimp after all my anxiety is getting a little better during the day and people say it gets worse before it gets better… I really should have listened to my gut instinct but I was so desperate for Zoloft to work since I have been through hell this year… Within 3 months… I lost my biz, my home, my dad, dealt with anxiety attacks through the roof, night terrors (nocturnal panic attacks) and daily panic attacks… Let’s just say I was at the end of my rope ready to die and I started to actually vision it with great detail! – I still have a ton more scary stress coming my way and it won’t be over for another few months not to mention now I need surgery due to my gallbladder.  Anyways, I went back to my original psychiatrist this month (2 weeks ago) and told him I was on Zoloft and this is when I learned he wanted me on Paxil last year but, since I am already on Zoloft we will see how it goes. Keep in mind that I never really told him how bad I was doing on Zoloft because like I said above… I really thought it would get better. Well, it has been going horribly wrong I have experienced… Insomnia, Diarrhea and Loose stools , Dry mouth, Fatigue, Indigestion, Shakiness (tremor), Loss of appetite, Increased sweating, Tingling sensation in my hands (paresthesias), Headache (Migraines), Abdominal pain (stomach pain), Constipation, Hot flashes , Nervousness, Hyperactivity, Anxiety, Agitation, Hostility and Aggressiveness, Suicidal thoughts, Chest palpitations, Panic attacks, Shakiness, Internal restlessness and Jitteriness and Acne (boils). A few of these side effects mentioned above have mellowed out and that is why I thought it would get better, however I still have the painful boils, hyperactivity (feel like I am on speed), abdominal pain, constipation and loose stools, migraines, insomnia, dry mouth, chest palpitations, hostility, shakiness, internal restlessness and Jitteriness. Just last night I could not fall a sleep until 4:30 am and woke up at 6:30 am (waking up 6 times in between). I have been doing this for way too long and it is just getting worse. I really need a med that is more sedating vs. activating. I miss sleeping peacefully for 8-10hrs and waking up refreshed. Now everything wakes me up even the sound of the light wind and even if I did sleep harder I would still wake up every few minutes with my body internally vibrating.  My psychiatrist called after I finally called his nurse to tell him what is going on and he called back and told me to “STOP the Zoloft immediately”!! I guess he wants to try another med which is scary for me because I don’t want the same things to happen, but the other thing that is scary is what damage have I done to myself with this damn Zoloft, it should have been stopped when I told the other psychiatrist all this instead of being told it is all in my damn head. Man, my hubby is pissed and so am I!! At any rate, I wonder if I will ever be normal again and if there is any better SSRI’s out there that can help my GAD, BPD, OCD, Depression and now INSOMNIA!! I have never done speed but OMG, if this is how it feels... beam me up Scotty because I cannot do this anymore!! I miss sleeping 8-10 hrs. a night.  So with all this said, can anyone please please please point me in the right direction and educate me on the most sedating meds that help with all my symptoms… I am considering Seroquel. Thank you for taking the time to read my post - Hugs! "

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/10mg-fluoxetine-lovan-condition-3308702.html,Is 10mg of fluoxetine (Lovan) enough to help with my condition?,"Hi, I gave recently been suffering from quite bad anxiety which had led to several panic attacks in a short space of time. I had to resign from my job as the panic attacks become unbearable, and has now led to being down and depressed because of the panic and anxiety. Although I have always been naturally anxious, I guess I have dealt with it fine in the past but the work stress really took its toll on me and I guess I came close to a mental break down (or maybe that was a mental break down). When I had experienced my very first panic attack over 2 years ago, I bounced back fairly quickly. The last 3 weeks, I experienced about 3-4 panic attacks and it has really taken its toll on me and haven't been able to bounce back, hence the feeling of depressed. I am usually a very upbeat, positive, sharp go getter type of person but this time round, I have had to give in for some help with medication. Obsessed with over researching everything, I felt so anxious going on antidepressants because of all the bad reviews and warnings you read about it. Today I took my first 10mg of fluoxetine and I guess I just want to hear other people's experience with this drug. Side effects etc. I read and heard that it hasn't got as bad side effects as other ones but I should be prepared to get worse before I get better. Is this true, and how bad is ""worse"". I will ride it out, but of course, being anxious already, it makes you even more anxious thinking about another potential panic attack. Sometimes I think panic attacks and anxiousness is worse than emotions, as in, I can deal with emotions and being down better than I can anxiety. Any help, advice, stories would be helpful. "
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/first-couple-weeks-prozac-1009178.html,First couple of weeks on prozac?,"I've been suffering from anxiety and depression for the past few years and I've started taking prozac to help me deal with it. I'm now in week 2 of taking 20 mg each night and I'm not really sure if it's working or not. The first few days were pretty bad, I went from feeling completely euphoric the first day to waking up feeling out of my mind with panic the second morning. Now it seems to have levelled out somewhat, but I still get ups and downs that have drastic effects on my behaviour. For example, some days I feel so confident and focussed to the point that I'm amazed at how well I am able to talk to others etc. Other days I am so anxious and apathetic I can barely leave the house. Is this likely to get better in the following weeks? I've read other similar questions to this online, a lot of answerers were claiming that it would ""get easier soon"" and to ""stick it out for a month and you'll feel okay"". I really hope this is true in my case. I have tried both cialopram and zoloft and both of them gave me horrible reactions, so I'm hoping that prozac is the right med for me given that I haven't experienced this. I've also noticed that when I have a couple of drinks on a night out, I wake up feeling as though I haven't taken any medication at all and like I'm back at square one. I only did this a couple of times in the first week, and have stopped drinking since - is this likely to continue to happen if I drink sensible amounts or will it stop when the adjustment period has finished and my body is used to the medication? My final question is about prozac's effect on tourettes syndrome. I have had this since early childhood and have never taken any of the recommended medications for it due to them all having horrendous side effects that I really don't want to experience.  My symptoms are mild muscle twitches and are not really noticeable to others, however for me they are tiring and my face constantly aches. I was worried that when taking prozac these symptoms might be worsened, but to my surprise they initially seemed to lessen over the first week. Some days I barely notice them and come close to forgetting that I have the condition, whereas it is usually on my mind constantly. Other days the symptoms seem to return. I am wondering if the tourettes symptoms fading away is likely to be a temporary occurrence during the adjustment period to the drug? I have never heard of prozac being used to treat this condition, but I read somewhere that tourettes is linked closely with anxiety and OCD, both of which prozac are supposed to help according to my GP. The past few days they have returned and I am wondering if I should ask to increase my dose and see if that works. I have noticed that the symptoms tend to be more apparent at the end of a long day when I need to re-dose on the med, then when I take another tablet it's like a warm pressure spreads throughout my body and head that for some reason lessens my compulsion twitch constantly, it's like I'm forgetting to do it. If anyone could shed light as to what is happening here I'd be very grateful, I know this is pretty poorly written, but I am very spaced out at the moment. "

On vyvanse, prozac and xanax?","On 40 mg vyvanse in the morning, 60 mg of prozac each day and 1 mg xanax before bed to sleep. I’m just having a really hard time with anxiety and stress. I have a 2 ½ year old son and now 12 month old daughter. In December, I went to my PCP for a sinus infection and ended up having a breakdown in the exam room. Since then, I have tried several antidepressants (lexapro, effexor xr, viibryd and now prozac), am currently on vyvanse so I can concentrate and be productive at work, and xanax at night to sleep and keep my obsessive thoughts away. I’m still a complete mess. Based on the different professionals I have seen since December --- I have anxiety, depression and OCPD (obsessive compulsive personality disorder). I don’t know if I have panic attacks near daily from the medication or if I’ve just reached my breaking point with all of the stress in my life. I can barely go a night without having at least a beer or two after work to unwind because if I take the xanax too early - I can barely do my nightly tasks. I work full-time, and my husband is a police officer – so his schedule always comes first. I see a social worker/counselor every two weeks and a psychiatrist once a month. If I see either of them on a good day, there are no problems. It’s the bad days that I feel completely worthless and like I’m not living my life the way that I could be if I were happy. I completely lose control of my emotions and can't get out of the slump and feeling of complete worthlessness. At times I try to stop my medications cold turkey and can’t even get out of bed. I don’t know where to turn because I’ve been having more emotional breakdowns in the past month than I have ever in my life. I don’t want to end up in a psych ward because according to my doctors I do not have a mental illness, just problems with anxiety, stress, and depression. I feel like I can't handle my life as it is any longer. Oh - and I've also lost about 35 lbs since December (55 lbs since my daughter was born last August). I'm about 5'5 and weigh at most 110 lbs. I have no desire to eat. I actually feel nauseas thinking about food but end up shoving food down my throat at the end of the day because I'm so fatigued. Any suggestions? Anyone can relate? "

Low-dose Adderall (10-20 mg tablet 1 x per day) and lowest 'effective' dose of Zoloft (50 mg) are unlikely to result in catastrophic events... although I'd keep some Valium around, just in case.

I suffer from OCD and depression and have been on Zoloft for nine months. In the beginning I lost about 6 lbs but now I really put on weight and even though Zoloft literally saved my life I know I cannot take this drug anymore. I am on a diet, I exercise but my weight increases no matter what I do. I went to see my doctor and she said that I am the first patient that has ever put on weight because of sertraline! I tried a lot of drugs and only Zoloft helped me. The only drug I didn't try is Prozac and my doc said it isn't suppose to cause a gain weight. But from i read, all the ssris do, Prozac even more than Zoloft!  SO MY QUESTION IS:Is there any chance that if I now switch to Prozac I also lose weight at first and start to gain weight after w few months or my metabolism is already broken that much that changing to fluoxetine won't make any difference and the only chance for me right now to lose weight is to stop taking meds?  I don't know what to do, I cannot live without drugs because I am a total mess, I am not even able to go to work because I am crying all day long. But on the other hand, right now I feel horrible knowing that once I used to be skinny and now I look disgusting :( I feel like I'm in a fix, like there's no good choice for me right now. "

I have been on Citalopram for about 4 months (before that Sertraline which was average for me, but helped considerably in the long term) (both meds for ocd and depression).  After speaking to my doctor i increased the dosage to 30 mg 4 weeks & 3 days ago because it i was not feeling much of it.

It also makes me feel extremely tired, this run down feeling, still get annoyed, agitated by little things, tendency to worry and overthink and does not make me really relaxed enough. Yesterday morning and the morning before I felt very relaxed for a while but then the feeling wears of, as if the med is working for 1-2 hours and then effect decreases.  My question is should i  - 1. Stay on 30 mg for about a week and see how i feel, if no difference gradually increase the dosage (35 mg then 40 mg)? -2. Or else taper down and go back to Sertraline or try another ssri?  The problem with the second option is as some of you may have experienced is that changing to another srri can be a difficult process, e.g. symptoms of depression and ocd increasing, side effects etc. (for me it was a difficult transition from Sertraline to Citalopram) I am slightly disappointed with Citalopram, was expecting more of it.

I have OCD, BPD, Situat/General Anxiety, Claustrophob, Depression?","I am new to this support group but not to the? sight, I usually come here to compare meds and do some of my research, however I NEED to reach out and get answers (I just hope there are answers for me). At any rate, this is very long but I would greatly appreciate it if someone or ones can please shed some light for me…. I have OCD, Borderline Personality disorder, Anxiety both situational and general, claustrophobia, and depression. Wow! I just said a mouthful here; I am surprised I am even functioning. I am ran by severe non-stop anxiety and I have been on Generic Zoloft for 4 weeks and 3 days now. I started at 50mg, increased to 75mg a week later and 2 weeks later I increased to 100mg. (been on 100mg for 3 days now). Z made me feel like a live wire, tossing and turning to the point I felt like I was on a rotisserie, my mind and body would not shut down and when it did start to shut down and I began to drift… I would immediately awake gasping in terror and dread. I had the Shakes’ as if my body was vibrating and my body would occasionally jerk, waking up every 10mins, there was a time I couldn't even go to sleep (I was up for 2 days straight) that was scary and I had to take a klonopin .5mg but even with the Klonopin, I would only sleep for a couple hrs. and wide awake again.  This also happened with each increase 50mg and 75mg, I am knocking on wood that I have yet had this problem with the increase of 100mg (3 days now). BUT, I still don't sleep like I use to. I use to sleep 8-10 hrs. and lovvvvved it! I would only wake up IF I needed to pee. Now I can only sleep 4-6hrs a day and I wake up 2-4x's in-between and I sleep REALLY light.  I still feel restless at times, I still feel the anxiety breaking through daily and a ton more when I am dealing with a stressful situation which I am currently in a stressful crisis and will be for the next few months, I still sweat easily but not as much however, my kids say that my room is cold with my A/C being so looow and I am still warm/hot (my hubby and kids call me a heater). I still get the shakes/trembles and if I do sleep for any longer than 2hrs straight... I wake up feeling a bit dread and my body vibrates so, I will get out of bed and try to shake it off and it does help after 15-30 mins (it's weird).  My mind still carries on and on when I lay down for bed and this goes on into my sleep about my stressful situation and upcoming events… I wish it would just stfu already!  At any rate, if I look back and compare before Z and 4weeks later on Z, I would say that I can see an improvement in many things during the day but it has been subtle and not like a light switch like many people say that they experience and not nearly as I would expect or hope because my anxiety is still there daily/nightly and I am starting to get angry about it. I saw my General Doc (not my psychiatrist) and talked to her since I had an unrelated apt with her and I feel comfortable with her since she has decent enough knowledge to know if an ssri is working or not on someone based on the info/symptoms that the patient gives her. At any rate, She told me that it should be working by now and that I should not be going through any of this at this point of 4 weeks and that I should call my psychiatrist and ask for a change but I keep thinking maybe I need to give it more time since I just went to 100mg but idk what to think anymore since I have read so many different things on its dosages, it effectiveness for anxiety or shall I say ineffectiveness since it is for depression and not for any type of anxiety and if you only feel slight improvements after 4 weeks then it is not the right SSRI. My General Doc told me that she swears by Zoloft and Lexapro but their hospital/medical center’s Psychiatrist prescribes a lot of anxiety patients Effexor which is an SSNI's.  I just don’t know any more on what to do or what to expect, I know that everyone is different and all meds work differently for everyone, so no one can tell me what is the best med that is NOT a benzo to personally take but if someone can relate and shed some light on my situation… I would GREATLY appreciate it more than I can express. I am just so tired and frustrated!! ((hugs)) Diana "

It no doubt would ease the withdrawl from subutex or suboxone also which are partial opiates. The drug companies do not seem to want to help us neither do the detox Doctors. Detox Doctors want to keep you on subutex or suboxone, big money involved here. Apparently so do the drug companies. It is impossible to taper off of the 8mg. pill, after breaking it into quarters it just crumbles and I do not think the medicine is evenly distributed throughout the pill. An 8mg. pill costs the same price as a 2mg. pill. Go figure. The information I found on your site is a light in the dark for me. I want to stop subutex but need something to help with the detox, I know soma helps some and people say methocarbamol does well.

I have been addicted to every kind of opiate out there and have been on methadon for 2 years. I quit the methadone ct and it was living hell for 8 solid weeks but I did it. Then quite quickly relasped. About 6 months ago I met a friend who takes suboxone and she introduced me to a better way of handling my cravings each week. When I met her I was doing atleast one oxy 40mg a day or 10 vicodin 10s a day. Well, needless to say I began buying suboxone from her and taking it. I took 2mg twice a day at first and then went down over the last two months to 2mg only once a day. Although I am not on a very high dose, I feel like I should get into an actual suboxone treatment program. On the two mg per day I get cravings to take more all the time, and I still have cravings to use. I just dont know what to do because I live in upstate NY and it is extremely difficult to get into a clinic here. Every doctor is at capacity and cant accept new patients. When I take 4mg a day I am happy and content all day. Does this mean I am not ready to stop taking the suboxone. I do not even really want to be off the suboxone. The reason I am going down on my dose is because every month I wind up having to find subs at the end of the month when she doesnt have any more and then having to go a day or so without. It is just a huge pain and I spend 200 dollars a month, which I really cant afford, on these subs. I just do not know what to do and I need some advice. Do i work really hard to just stop the suboxone while I am already at a fairly low dose? Or do I look for a suboxone doctor and try to get in somewhere. The fact is I may not be able to get into a suboxone clinic anytime soon. I am just tired of the games and want to be done with the suboxone with a slow taper rather than wait til I run out and have to just jump off. I have six sub 8mgs right now and if I start tapering down now going from 1.5mg a day to 1mg a day to .5 and then .25, and lastly to .125. I may have to buy more but I will just deal with that when the time comes. Also, every time I have a bad day I always want to take some extra sub to make the day a little better. I just need advice.

Opiate Dependence,https://www.drugs.com/answers/starting-suboxone-tomorrow-need-advice-183268.html,Starting suboxone tomorrow - need advice?,"Being a person who takes on average 300mg of percocets per day (30 pills at 10mg a piece-and have on some days taken up to 60 pills per day-600mg of percocet/oxycodone) and who is starting suboxone tomorrow-ANYONE WHO IS IN THE SAME SITUATION.HAS HAD THE SAME SITUATION AS ME, can advise the best time for me to start my first dose of suboxone. I already have my suboxone prescription filled. I have 90 tablets at 8mg per piece, the doctor wrote for 3times per day but also CLEARLY TOLD ME for my first dose/first day or even the first few days I may need to and am allowed to take 4 pills. He said when I start to take one pill, wait 20 minutes, if I don't feel better, take another, wait 20 more minutes, take a third if needed and so on up to a fourth IF NEEDED to feel better. My main question (since I just wrote about 10 paragraphs and they accidentally got deleted, so I am trying to sum this up now) is THIS-I WILL BE ABLE TO GO at least 18-19 hours taking NO PAIN MEDS BEFORE STARTING THE SUBOXONE TOMORROW, I took about 25 norcos TODAY instead of my usual 10mg percs, I took 10mg norcos, and took a little less than usual, and took them all since early this morning, the last 5 I took around 1:45PM. This last week I have been trying to take a little less than usual on most days and also take a medicine not as strong as my CHOICE (10mg percocets) so I went back and forth all week between percocet 7.5mgs and 10mg norcos, and tried taking a little less than USUAL. But yesterday I took at least 35-40 10mg pills (I wanted to have ONE LAST HURRAH since I planned on starting today and my brain was ""rationalizing"" the STUPID DECISION), figuring I was NEVER GOING to take any again after last night so I may as well ""ENJOY MYSELF A LITTLE BIT"", but things didn't work out as planned. So, my doctor also said it was ok to take valium to sleep and try to wait as long as possible before starting suboxone (as it is recommened to wait 24 hours) but I have tried and the longest I have been able to cope with was 16 hours, but I have it all timed out now to START TOMORROW, and PURPOSELY LEFT MYSELF WITH NO PAIN MEDS, so there is no turning back now-tomorrow is SUNDAY-and I know I will be going to bed early tonight, waking up early tomorrow, wanting to start the suboxone AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, but also do not want to put myself into withdrawals as I have read happens frequently when a person does not WAIT LONG ENOUGH and still has opiates in their bloodstream. I think that due to the LARGE AMOUNTS I HAVE TAKEN FOR SO LONG, it will take a while for them to be out of my bloodstream and I will not be able to bear the withdrawals, the body aches, the runny nose and yawning, and the fatigue, which is already going to start in a few hours, I will deal with, I dealt with it this morning before breaking down and taking norcos while trying to get my suboxone prescription filled. I will take valium to sleep and I will try to hold off as long as I can in the morning. But ADVICE FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS HAD A HABIT LIKE MINE, would be GREATLY APPRECIATED to tell me-if you suggest I start my suboxone as early as I can tomorrow morning-which will have allowed at least 17-19 hours to have elapsed since the last 5 pills I took before-do you think this will help me (and I will follow the doctors orders, starting with one 8mg pill and waiting 20 minutes and so on, taking more if needed) or do you think that due to the large amounts I have been taking for so long that this could cause me to go into even WORSE WITHDRAWALS IF I TRY TO STICK it out a few extra hours and maybe even take another valium when I get up tomorrow and try to sleep longer, so that more hours will have elapsed and I can try to make it to 24 hours untl I start the suboxone. PLEASE ADVISE. If it were up to me, I would start the suboxone right now, but I KNOW IT WILL GIVE ME IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWALS as I have taken norcos all morning and FEEL GREAT RIGHT NOW, but I want to be OFF THESE PAIN MEDS with as little discomfort as possible. So, will it be ok for me to start the suboxone early tomorrow morning or should I try to hold out longer. Originally I was also told I could even start the suboxone 12 hours after my last dose of pain meds, but that I would probably end up beinig VERY UNCOMFORTABLE for the first 24 hours, I don't want to be VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. This is why I spent almost $1000 today between the doctor and the prescription because I want to be as comfortable as possible and NOT FEEL SICK-I want this transition to be AS SMOOTH AS POSSIBLE. I wish I could have started today, but long story (which I accidentally deleted), after going 16 hours with no pain meds, I was having trouble getting the suboxone prescription filled, I was alone, driving around from pharmacy to pharmacy for hours trying to locate one that had it in stock and I BROKE DOWN AND TOOK SOME PAIN MEDS to deal with it, and then of course, right after I took some, the next pharmacy I went to, had it in stock, had I KNOWN THAT, I would have NEVER taken any pills today and I WOULD HAVE STARTED MY SUBOXONE ALREADY but of course, everything got all screwed up. Tomorrow is Valentines today, I was hoping to have started today and feel normal enough tomorrow to go to a movie but now I know I will most likely be in bed all day. Please just advise me on what best to do, and what to expect and ANY OTHER INPUT would be GREATLY APPRECIATED. "

I would rather go through hell than be fat, lazy, forgetful and broke. I have always been very active (dr allowed me to continue Mt climbing until I was 7 mo preg) and was in denial about how lazy this drug made me (It been a year since the baby and I haven't even been hiking). That drug self talk can be very convincing (I don't really have a problem, etc.). I did start withdrawing in August but didn't have time to go through the rough days (I only made it three days and then started again) but it was b/c I had to take care of my household and couldn't get out of bed. I have a stong will and a strong support this time, so I know I will be successful. I am just curious about other people's experience and any home remedies they used to ease the symptoms. "

Throughout this period, I have been regularly seeing a psychologist and working on CBT therapies. It was quickly evident that medication was necessary, as my symptoms are quite severe. Throughout this period of pharmacological treatment, I tried a variety of medications including SSRIs, and SNRI, benzodiazepines, an anti-psychotic, and a tricyclic. Each of these medications worsened the severity of my OCD (some more than others) significantly, such that I have been unable to remain on most of these medications for a very lengthy duration; the medications also seem to cause extreme fatigue. I am also very sensitive to most of the medications I have tried, and usually start at a dosage about 1/5th-1/10th of what is normally prescribed. For instance, I was on Zoloft for 4 months (I could tolerate this moderately well at a low dosage) at a dosage of 5 mg/day. I tried for one 4 week-period to increase to 10 mg/day, but was totally non-functional for this period. If I increase the dosage too much, the OCD becomes unbearable, and I am often debilitated by fatigue. I apologize for the lengthy description, but feel that I am running out of treatment options.

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/continue-sertraline-changing-back-fluoxetine-1162775.html,Need Help: Continue Sertraline Or Changing Back To Fluoxetine?,"Hi guys. I was on Fluoxetine 10mg for about 6 weeks, and I didn't feel anything, so I raised it to 20mg. After just few days, I started to feel huge improvements in my depression problems, OCD, and specially social anxiety. And I didn't have suicidal inclinations anymore. After about a month, I visited my psychiatrist again, and he advised me to raise it to 40mg. For some reasons*, plus the fact that I did not trust him much, I did something foolish. I decided to change to Sertraline. So I stopped taking Fluoxetine, waited 4 days, and then started taking Sertraline 50mg.    It's been 8 days now (so 12 days from stopping Fluoxetine), and I'm gradually having my depression, OCD and social anxiety back. I don't want my suicidal thoughts come back, because it hurts me so much. Besides that, I'm having insomnia (or maybe it's a change in sleep cycle, idk), plus sexual dysfunction, and I my eyes often go black when I stand up. Now, I want good results back, as soon as possible. What should I do, continue Sertraline or changing back to Fluoxetine? Does Fluoxetine kick in quickly this time? Please don't advise me talking to the psychiatrist, that's not an option for me right now.       *Some of the reasons I decided to change to Sertraline:   - I was having lowered blood pressure with Fluoxetine. I have always had a low blood pressure, so this extra drop was annoying. I feared that 40mg Fluoxetine may make it worse.   - While on Fluoxetine, I didn't have much difficulties falling asleep, but the quality of the sleep was awful.    - My brother, who has problems similar to mine, has had not a good experience with high doses of Fluoxetine, and said that Sertraline is working much better for him.   - Whenever I take Metoclopramide, which is a Dopamine antagonist, it makes me awfully depressed. So I thought maybe I have some problems with my Dopamine levels. Thus, Sertraline which has some small Dopamine reuptake inhibition effect may be a better choice. "

I was on 60mg of celexa (bad side effects). Went to a different doctor and he gave me Prozac. I soon stopped taking Adderall.  Prozac is fine, better than celexa but not as good as zoloft was.

It has worked amazingly and has made me able to actually go out in public again without having severe anxiety and panic attacks. It was pretty rough at the beginning of taking the med. I actually think it caused bad anxiety in the beginning. It was about 6 to 8 weeks before I started to really notice a difference in how reduced my anxiety was. The only complaint I have with the Escitalopram is the sexual side effects. Mainly erectile dysfunction and it seems to be a bit harder to ejaculate. At the beginning of taking the med getting an erection was near impossible and ejaculating pretty much was impossible. At the beginning though when I did manage to ejaculate I got this severe headache. This has passed now and erections and ejaculating definitely have got better. However I'm still not happy with the erections. Sometimes I can get fairly hard but then loose the hardness easily. I was hoping there's a chance this could still improve?I also used to be on prozac for 3 years back when I was 18 until 21 and I had the same issue. The prozac massively helped my severe anxiety but I had the ed side effect the entire time I was on it. I went a year and a half without being on an SSRI. I tried a few different types of medications for the severe anxiety but they just made me feel a lot worse. My life in the year and a half without being on an SSRI was terrible. I was near suicidal and everything because I felt like I was going insane and I was so anxious that I could hardly even leave the house. But now being on the 10mg of Escitalopram for just over 4 months I feel so much better. But I just can't cope with the ed side effect. Is there still time that this side effect could pass or even improve? Are any you guys out there on an SSRI or SNRI and don't experience the ed side effect? I was also wondering a good way to ween my self off Escitalopram? I was hoping my doctor could maybe get me a liquid formulation and I could go down a gram a week to avoid any chance of withdrawal. Is it possible to do that? I was also maybe thinking about trying a different SSRI or SNRI to see if I don't have the ed side effect. I was also wondering if I just stopped taking the Escitalopram and just switched straight to another SSRI or SNRI if this would avoid withdrawal because I'm switching straight to a new med of the same drug class?

I had some clothes and 1 sheet for my bed. I usually have a big load and put 2 cups of detergent but I had 2 small loads and still put 2 cups. That night after I took a shower, after I went to breastfeed my daughter (on my bed with the washed sheet) then after my neck started to feel really uncomfortably itchy and felt inflamed by my itching. Then that night it got worst. Went on my arms and legs. Went to the ER the next day, they gave me a generic version of Benadryl and an antibiotic to take for 5 days. The first time I took the Benadryl, it didn't kick in for an hour. After I took a half an hour nap, I woke up and I didn't feel itchy but these huge patches of red appeared on my upper arm, where my arm lays on my shirt. Only on the right side though. I also washed that shirt. I went to put on another shirt that I had not recently washed and it VERY slowly went away. After that I had to change due to leakage of my breast so I put on a T-shirt that I had ALSO not recently washed but the whole lining of my neck started to get itchy and on my chest and a little on my arms. Got tired of it so I took everything off and put on this dress I haven't washed recently, and it just gets worst. I have red inflamed bumps all over my upper and lower inner arm, the sides of my belly, both of my thighs, front and back of my calves, my neck, and also some on my face.. It's so itchy and the inflamed bumps are EVERYWHERE. it's currently 4:30 in the morning and I can't sleep due to the uncomfortable itching. I need help, please. Should I rewash everything including pillows and this other sheet I did not recently wash? Or am I wasting my time and money? "

I take 2mg klonopins as prescribed (3x a day) for when I get too anxious. Im also on seroquel zyprexa zoloft and adderal.  My problem is when I take the klononopins they dont seem to do much except make me kindof tired and depressed episodes seem to come on when I take them. Ive been on valium, xanex, ativan and klonopin. Klonopin has worked the best but I hardly feel any better when I take them.

I was on the buspirone (5mg. 3x/day) for about 2 weeks and towards the end of that I was feeling pretty good. I went to a primary and he suggested that I start citalopram(10mg) as well. He is using it off label for my anxiety and OCD. The first night I took it, I thought I was losing my mind. I did a 180. I went from feeling pretty good the past couple days to feeling like I was back at square one. A nurse friend of mine suggested that I cut the pills in half and take them every 12 hours. (so still get the same dose in 24hrs just a bit spread out) this seems to help a bit. I definitely still have trouble sleeping and wake up jittery and shaky and scared but not as severe as when I took the whole dose. My question is, how long will the side effects last? And when should I be worried that they wont quit? Or should I maybe just go back to only taking the buspirone since I was seeing results with that? I know they say antidepressants can make it symptoms worse before it gets better, but I feel legitimately crazy! The other problem is my anxiety is fear driven so when I get scared I honestly don't know if its the medication or if its me.

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/lexapro-feeling-real-improvements-feeling-3386720.html,"Lexapro - Not feeling any real improvements, feeling hopeless and really fearful?","This is my first post on this site which in the past has been a lot of help but now am feeling like the situation I’m in is so dire and so hard to deal with. I started taking Escitalopram (Lexapro) on January 22nd (6 Weeks) due to inability to sleep and a lot of anxiety as well as some intrusive/obsessive thinking. I’ve taken Lexapro in the past due to major depression and anxiety, and it really helped within about 2-3 weeks when I’ve first taken it. When I first started taking the medication this time around I started getting pretty intense side effects that I did not experience previously. I was getting really intense hot flashes the first week or so and I realized it was since I was taking 10 mg from the beginning, which I had done before but thought it would go away soon after. The hot flashes happened a lot while I was trying to sleep and paired along with intense thoughts. This intense phase luckily went away and I thought that my sleep would overall increase, however my sleep since then has really remained at sometimes sleeping for four hours then waking and taking melatonin to go back to sleep, or sometimes waking up every two hours. It’s been hell but am somewhat lucky because I recently moved back with my mom before this started occuring and I wasn’t working.  As far as the intrusive/obsessive thoughts, these have been on and off however symptoms of OCD have been pretty significant which I don’t remember really having as much before taking the medication this time around or ever. I am constantly checking everything I do more than once, and its making doing normal things impossible at times. I have also had a lot of chest tightness which sometimes is pretty strong and has a hot feeling to it when I get anxious. All of this is driving me crazy on top of the fact that I need to be getting back to work as soon as possible, but trying to sleep normally is seeming impossible.  I have tried to give the medication time to work since I have read that it is good to give it time even if it is a second/third time around on the medication. At this point it’s been over 6 weeks and trying to stay hopeful with a medication that had worked well for me before is now seeming dire although its putting me in a tough situation but now I have no idea when I’ll be able to relieve this if I do go on a different medication since I’m not sure how long it’ll take to wean off and be able to get a on a new medication. I’m considering trying Zoloft since it has seemed to help people who have switched from Lexapro. I’m so terrified of the situation I’m in and being home alone most of the time not working has been making it hard since my mind tends to race along with all of the symptoms im feeling. I’ve also started having a lot of suicidal thoughts and just want this pain to stop once and for all, I know I have to be strong but it’s so intense to deal with all of this :(.  I would really appreciate any insight on the situation and would really mean the world since I have not been in a situation where I’ve waited so long for something to work yet feel no real relief. Thank you so much for your time in advance, it really means the world right now. "

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/dizziness-zoloft-taking-months-3441098.html,Dizziness on Zoloft. I have been taking it for months?,"I'm a 23 year old female. Recently, I was diagnosed with OCD. I had extreme anxiety, mostly around health concerns (brain tumors, heart attacks, cancer, etc.) even though I have never had a major health issue. I couldn't function because I kept having panic attacks and 24/7 extreme anxiety, so I went to a psychiatrist and she prescribed me Zoloft because it worked well for my dad when he had MDD. I started on 25mg in June, bumped it down to 12.5mg because the side effects were terrible (vomiting, shakiness, dizziness, anxiety, blah). Slowly worked my way up to 25mg again and then to 50mg. I tried to go up to 75mg, but the side effects were intense (jitters, pupil dilation, mind fog, de-realization, headaches, nausea etc.) I called my doctor and she recommended alternating between 62.5mg and 75mg, but she still wanted me to eventually work my way up to 75mg. I started doing two days of 62.5mg and then one day of 75mg for about a mouth. Recently (within the past 2 weeks) I went to taking the lower dose every other day with the hopes of starting 75mg everyday. Clearly I'm very sensitive to medication. My question is, recently I have been getting dizziness and an off-balance feeling (kind of like a haze around my mind, brain fog) and slight head pressure, like a low-grade headache. It makes it hard to focus on my classwork in college and is causing me anxiety because now I'm worried it's a health thing and not the Zoloft. Can this still happen even after being on Zoloft since June? I have heard of these side effects at the beginning of taking it, but I've been on it for three months. Otherwise, my anxiety has been completely livable (I still get intrusive thoughts about health concerns, but I no longer obsessive over them and my anxiety hardly ever rises to an out-of-control feeling.) I'm seeing my doctor again soon, but I would hate to stop taking Zoloft because I do feel much better mentally. It's just the physical side effects that are making me upset.  Wondering if medicine effects me more because I'm a small person (100lbs). Thank you so much. I'm just feeling really discouraged and I'm at a loss. I just want to feel normal again. "

I’m 19, have no diseases and I don’t use any other medications. I’ve been taking unprescribed modafinil (Modalert) for 3-4 months, from a trustworthy website. The first time I took modafinil (200mg), it had an amazing effect. The next couple of times, it had zero effect - other than a sore throat. Modafinil has only truly worked for me a few times out of the 14 pills I’ve taken. Two weeks ago, I decided to try 400mg. It was just as amazing as the first time. Studied from 7am till midnight. Downside; didn’t sleep at all. 3 days later I started getting red, itchy spots on my arms, followed by a racing heartbeat. They kept swelling for two days before they disappeared. It helped a lot to take antihistamines. Then my wrists and two of my fingers began to swell. They got warm, sore and red, like if they were sprained. Still had a few rashes. 7 days later, I took another 400mg. It felt terrible. Concentration and mood was worsened, I felt dizzy and disoriented, fast heartbeat, burning cheeks and mild back pain. In the evening I started getting a few spots again. Some areas of my hands were still swollen. And no sleep of course. I haven’t taken modafinil since. Is there any possible way, that I can continue without physical harms? Will the allergic reactions stop, keep coming or maybe even get worse with each pill? How can I experience the wanted effects more frequently? Have you had a similar response to modafinil - and if so, what did you do? "

My assumption is a shower gel body wash I used Friday night caused the flare up. I've used this wash before without issue, but I've been told that really means nothing. I went to an urgent care clinic, and they gave me a steroid shot (can't remember name), and prescribed me 20mg Prednisone pills to take two times a day for 5 days, as well as Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream two times a day for 7 days.  I went to my normal doctor the next day, and was told the prescription is fine, and it should clear up soon. I'm now on day 3 of this prescription, and there's times where I look and it seems like the rash is clearing up, but then other times where it looks like there's been no improvement with additional spreading. I'm also taking Benadryl various times throughout the day to help with the itching, and to give me a good night's rest. From reading various forums online and the impact of using prednisone, I thought the rash would be gone by now, but maybe I have unreasonable expectations.  Any idea when I should contact my doctor and let her know the rash is still around? I travel for work this coming Sunday, so I was hoping it would be gone by then, but not sure that will happen.

I at first I thought I was allergic to the dyes in some sodas, then I realised that it was caffeine sometime last April.  I remember the first time I had a strange reaction I had just turned 18, and I had a few cups of coffee and two energy drinks that day (I don't remember what kind they were, they were some weird foreign drink that was on sale). Later that night I started getting a wierd tingling feeling in my spine, then it spread to my left leg. The next morning I was in so much pain I could hardly move. I tried heat and ice and nothing helped. It got so bad that I ended up going to the emergency room. They just told me that it was growing pains, gave me a prescription for ibuprofen and sent me home. It eventually went away, but it would periodically come back. It almost always started in the left leg but after that it spread to both legs most of the time. I only realised that it was caffeine doing it because there was one point in time that I gave up soda and energy drinks and only occasionally drank coffee. I stopped getting the pains and they would only return when I drank caffeine(Usually in the form of coke or pepsi, which is why I thought it was the dyes).

Went to my local Urgent Care, and the doctor said it was just a cold sore and prescribed me with some Valacyclovir. I mentioned to him that I took Naproxen for a headache and am currently taking Lisinopril for high BP. Fast forward to this week, and I take some more Naproxen for a headache. 2 hours later, i'm getting a cold sore- in the same exact spot. Would this be an allergic reaction or just coincidental?

Please don't reply with personal opinions that will cause me to worry more about my situation. Does anxiety (side effect) from Zoloft (sertraline) feel like anxiety from a cup of coffee, or does it feel like anxiety from an actual situation you're experiencing? Here's my story: About every three years or so I experience what I call an ""episode"" where anxiety comes over me very quickly and I focus and worry about an issue that normally wouldn't bother me. It takes over my mind so that it's all I can think about for weeks. This leads to instant insomnia and loss of appetite. I have been diagnosed with OCD. I describe this as ""OCD of my thoughts"", NOT physical actions like checking locks, straightening up, etc. I have been taking Zoloft (sertraline) for the past 19 years. Most of these 19 years I have been taking 100mg. This drug has worked well for me with little side effects. Two years ago I reduced to 50mg. Then recently I stopped taking it completely. This lasted for about 7 weeks and then I had a change at work which caused anxiety to hit me like a ton of bricks. So I started taking 100mg for 4 days and then increased to 150mg quickly because I was so scared. I have been taking this along with Xanax for the past 5 weeks. The difference between this episode and past episodes is that I constantly feel an increased heart rate and shakiness for no real reason, and feel like I need to take Xanax to just calm down. I can't relax and go about my day normally. I have read that taking Zoloft can actually cause anxiety. My doctor says that anxiety from medication ""feels different"" from anxiety caused by an actual situation. He also is OK with me increasing my dosage to 200mg, but I am fearful that will cause more anxiety. I am wondering if I actually need to reduce my dosage to 100mg, but that is a scary thought as well. "

I was absolutely great on it until I had a particularly stressful time at work and my doc upped my dose to 150 mg , took a long time to settle down with side effects but eventually did Earlier this year I decided to try and reduce my med gradually as I felt very woozy especially on a morning .  I did this myself ,by 25mg each day and as you can guess suffered side effects so went back up to 150 after a few weeks. This was about 6 weeks ago and I am still suffering light headed , 'foggy head' feelings. I have had eyes, bloods taken, BP checked, thyroid etc all normal. My doctor has suggested my dose maybe too high and wants me to gradually reduce back to 100mg . He has given me the liquid drug and I plan to try reducing by very small amounts (10mg) per week. I am very nervous of this as my OCD and mood is generally under control but I am tired of this fuzzy head . I have a stressful job in a hospital and have never taken time off work . I feel like maybe it may be time to reduce but dreading any additional side effects.  Has anyone reduced back to 100 and been fine ? Should I continue on 150 and hope the 'head' gets better?

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/heavily-sedated-escitalopram-lexapro-advice-3436476.html,Heavily sedated on escitalopram (Lexapro). Advice please?,"I've now completed 4 weeks on generic escitalopram (1 week @5mg, 3 weeks @10mg, all taken in the morning). I'm struggling with almost constant severe fatigue, visual disturbance (blurred vision/""halo"" effects) and an inability to concentrate. Initially I was very positive about the medication as I'd heard very good reviews, and for the first week I felt a sense of calm (probably the sedation). I had a major breakdown in June due to a combination of a job change and an adverse reaction to restarting fluoxetine (Prozac). I was suicidal for about a month, but reluctantly concluded that I probably need some kind of medication. I attempted to start a phased return to work (Mon 20th Aug), I was feeling very optimistic and had zero anxiety. I was really looking forward to getting back to work. At this point, I hadn't seen the sedation as a negative thing, as it had helped me stop my obsessive worrying. About 30 mins into my first day back, I realized that I couldn't keep my eyes open for more than 2 minutes, and I was falling asleep at my desk. I was unable to read spreadsheets or emails easily. I wasn't too worried at this point, I just put it down to being tired on my first day back. I was only in the office for 4 hours. I slept well on the Monday night, but the same problems occurred on Tuesday. I drove home, but I really shouldn't have, I was falling asleep at the wheel. I fell asleep as soon as I got home (3pm). Wednesday was the same. By this point I was beginning to panic, as I felt like the side effects were getting worse each day. I couldn't go in on Thursday, due to anxiety over whether or not I should continue the medication. Until Thursday, I'd deliberately only read the positive reviews of escitalopram on this site in order to reinforce the positivity. I've now discovered that this seems to be a very common problem. With my job, I cannot accept even the slightest level of abnormal fatigue in the long run. Given that the fatigue, constant yawning and blurred vision are still present today (Friday 24th, day 21 @10mg, day 28 total), I'm not sure whether they ever will go away, particularly the fatigue. I'm sure my psych will spurt out the usual ""these are common and should subside with time"", but most people's experience seems to be that the feeling of sedation/lethargy hangs around for the long term if it's still there at 4 weeks. I took 60mg duloxetine for 2 years for GAD/OCD when I was 18: had no noticeable start-up side effects, and some mild withdrawal effects. I then took 20mg fluoxetinefor 5.5 years from the age of 22 until I stopped last year: zero start-up side effects from what I remember, and absolutely zero withdrawal symptoms. I don't recall feeling euphoric on either drug, but I accomplished incredible things during the period with very little anxiety. I don't recall either having a sedating effect of any kind, and I felt ""normal"". I tried to restart fluoxetineas I had felt the anxiety and obsessiveness creep back in during 2018, and I wanted to be prepared ahead of starting a promotion at work. I took it for 9 days, from day 4 I was unable to sleep and I became suicidal with anxiety. I halted the fluoxetine, but I have been signed off work until last Monday. My issues with the once reliable fluoxetine led me to read about issues with SSRIs, and I'm now extremely fearful of them, even though I'm worried I can't function without them. I opted for escitalopram after extensive research. After my experience with fluoxetine, the last thing I expected was for the escitalopram to cause excessive sedation. I'm back feeling suicidal now, relying on diazepam to keep me vaguely sane. I've now become obsessed with the medication decision, I can't focus my mind on anything else. I keep flipping between ""just give it more time, you can't survive without ADs, especially after a breakdown"" to ""you need to taper off this stuff now, you can't afford more time to wait and see, you'll lose your job, and withdrawal will only get harder and harder the longer you're on it"". In my ideal world, I'd like to get back on fluoxetine as all of my best experiences have been while being on this drug, but because it has such a long half-life, it will take even longer to know whether I can settle on it again, and I'm not sure I can tolerate any more uncertainty. Sorry for the long message, but any similar experiences or advice would be appreciated. Many thanks "

I have struggled with OCD and anxiety my entire life, been on about a dozen different SSRI since i can remember and visiting just as many psychiatrists. I go through short periods of feeling better followed by long bouts of severe depression, obsessive compulsive behaviors and anxiety, after my last meds (citalopram and cymbalta) i took a break from everything with a feeling of just giving up on finding the right med for me. I tried to go with living a healthy life (eating right, exercise, trying harder to socialize, taking vitamins, and stay away from alcohol or any other mind altering substances.) again i had a short period of relief but now im back to the same feeling of depression and anxiety, not even wanting to get out of bed. even worse is my social anxiety is so bad I am avoiding people at all cost and when i do run into somebody i have a severe panic attack and cant even form sentences. I couldn't take it anymore and went back to another psychiatrist who prescribed me 200 mg modafinil to get me out of bed, help lift my brain fog and with hopes of giving me the motivation and confidence to talk to people again. i have been taking the modafinil for about 3 weeks, every other day or other couple of days as needed.

I gradually tapered off of the sertraline, however I did not and still have not taken the Wellbutrin. So, currently I am medication free.  It has really only been the last couple of weeks, maybe even the last month, but I have noticed a major increase in anger. I have borderline personality disorder, so I often deal with inappropriate emotions, or emotions that are often much stronger than they should be in a given situation. But I feel like my anger has been more out of control than it has ever been in the past. I've withdrawn from people because of it because I'm scared of lashing out on someone and ruining friendships/relationships. It really is kind of scaring me.

I have anxiety, OCD, depression, chronic pain conditions, etc. Prozac seemed to help my OCD markedly, but it didn't do much for my depression, and it seemed to make my anxiety even worse - to the point where I've recently started having panic attacks, whereas I didn't have them prior to taking Prozac. I'm not saying that Prozac directly caused them, but I think there's a link there. Anyway, I know that Prozac has an exceptionally long half-life, so even though my doctor said to simply stop taking the 40mg of Prozac and start taking the 50mg of Luvox, I'm concerned about serotonin syndrome and/or other scary side-effects from starting Luvox while Prozac is still in my system (due to the half-life of Prozac, not because I'll be taking the two together; I certainly won't!). I expressed that concern to my doc, and she simply advised me to be on the look-out for symptoms that might indicate serotonin syndrome. Well, symptoms of that can often mimic symptoms of a panic attack, so that wasn't the most helpful or comforting answer, IMO. I'm hoping to hear from people who have made the switch from Prozac to Luvox, or from Prozac to any other SSRI really - but not vice versa or from some other SSRI to some other SSRI, please, because it's the half-life of Prozac that I'm specifically concerned about. I'm thinking about cutting the Luvox tablets in half for the first few days or week, and only taking 25mg to begin with, but I'm still worried about how 25mg of it would interact with the Prozac. Basically, I'm just terrified to have more than one SSRI in my system at once - period. LOL. Personal experiences? :) "

I didn’t want to go back on meds again, but my doctor at the time said ‘you need to go back on them otherwise I can’t help you’ I burst into tears thinking ‘fine, I’ll take them for the rest of my life, then’ Anyway, went on them, and still wanting my life to end I pushed up my own dose. The doctors told me no more than 200mg. Because my depression was still really bad i thereafter stuck at 200mg on advice from the doctor. She also gave me an extra anti depressant because it was still very bad. Trazodone. Before I’d started retaking them btw, i was suffering headaches, I’d had food poisoning so i was always feeling sick, tired, stressed so had irritable bowl syndrome, trouble sleeping etc. Back on them my physical symptoms didn’t change, but my lows weren’t so bad n I don’t feel suicidle anymore. It’s 2018, and I’ve had support from my doctors about my headaches, n found a huge relief that they’re migraines and so I have medication specifically for it. Anyway these days, my parents are urging me to reduce my sertraline dose... my Dad saying i sound like an alcoholic giving excuses, and my Mum convinced my headaches are caused by my high sertraline dosage. They suggested it with my professional (not sure of her title, psychologist? I think?) n she said sertraline causes headaches. I’ve not agreed to reduce my dose coz my headaches aren’t any different to how they’ve always been, but my ‘psychologist’ has already put on my letter that I’ve reduced my intake... she’s made other assumptions in the past. But I could do with talking to someone ‘unbiased’ about pros, cons, likeliness and general info. I’m from the UK btw, so our doctors info isn’t always reliable, and they often forget certain bits of training or protocol because they’re too busy. My current knowledge of my headaches/list of excuses are: - Knots in shoulder/neck - air pressure - eye strain (usually when stressed) - feeling ill; i.e coughs, sore throat etc...

I am now in my early thirties. I've always just managed it myself and just accepted it as a part of who I was and actually felt I managed myself very well especially without the help of medication. However, years later I found myself in the midst of an extreme mental/physical/manipulative abusive relationship for 4 years along with my child. I was able to free myself from that environment 2 years ago however, it has not stopped the stress. I also experienced the loss of a family member during that time as well and feel like the whirlwind mixture of constant emotional struggle and state of mind with being stressed out so severely I believe sent me into a manic state of depression, anxiety to the point that started to affect my health. I started encountering ocular migraines to the point where I couldn't see for hours at a time. Would become suddenly dizzy the entire room would spin and at first this sensation was just something that occurred every once in a while then it escalated to a constant state of being dizzy. I lost 15 pounds in 3 weeks. I couldn't eat, I was thrown into a state of denationalization, emotional numbness. Feeling this way is and was so terrifying because you can't control it and wonder if you'll ever feel normal again. So I decided to go to the doctor and was prescribed Cymbalta. I was on it for almost 2 years. I will say that after taking it all those feeling slowly subsided, I felt normal once again eventually, and my dizziness went away all together. Other than gaining weight and the weird withdraw feeling from missing a dose, it really did help me for the past almost 2 years. I then just recently decided I felt pretty good, good enough to try to start weening myself from this medicine. I just wanted to be drug free again. Thought I could do it. Went to the doctor and was prescribed 20 mgs from my usual 60mgs by accident. Due to the label, I was mistakenly thinking I was taking 40mgs when I was actually taking 20mgs. I did this for 3 weeks and was fine until I woke up one morning and was sent straight into a fit of terrorizing thoughts and irrational thoughts and my anxiety and everything was back 10 folds. I can only imagine that the cause of this could have been due to my accidental sudden Cymbalta decrease? I went to the doctor and we realized this issue with my accidental sudden decrease in milligrams. So my Doctor then prescribed me 50mg Zoloft, and I've been taking it for 4 weeks now. It has been a very very rough 5-6 weeks since these effects have been happening to me. I'm just wondering if anyone else has gone through this feeling disconnected and not themselves when transitioning to a new medication? I'm almost feeling like I should just go back on the Cymbalta.

Doc said I don't have enough serotonin and that lexapro would fix that. First week was bad, kept getting nausea, depressed for no reason some times, some random anxiety. But the second week was alot better; less side effects and more being able to finally relax. Third week was great, almost no side effects and I was happy and able to easily let go of whatever anxious thoughts popped into head (because before taking this med I used to obsess for months over any anxious thought and then obsess over another one as soon as I got rid of the current one).

One night (on my 4rth week of Lexapro) I had a panic attack and another night I was really depressed and having no interest in anything I usually like about my life.   The thing is that I'm going to have my period in about a week and my anxiety always gets even WORSE in the week before my peeiod. So could it be that the Lexapro is working but I'm just having my usual pre-period anxiety?? I mean, my practitioner said that the reason I always have anxiety is because I don't make enough serotonin like other people do. So if the medicine is fixing that by making me have as much serotonin as is normal, then shouldn't that mean that i should still be having the same reactions as other people who have normal serotonin levels? You know? Like how I still cry and get anxious over actual life problems like other people do, not ALL the time like before the Lexapro? So wouldn't that include pre-period anxiety as well?

Please give me input. I’ve been on Prozac 20 mg for over three years now and it seem to work fine for me until it very difficult depressive and anxiety slump I had back late October. My doctor had tried to increase my Prozac to 40 mg without success. And by that I mean I could not handle the side effects! My anxiety got so bad it was 24 seven and I couldn’t cope. So We discontinued the increase and she put me on some BuSpar. I think I like the BuSpar it seems to help but I’m still feeling not myself and low. Much better than I did thank God! But my doctor and I have been discussing trying something else like a different SSR I. I’m just so scared and nervous if I try switching over to a different SSRI I’m going to have just as bad symptoms. We discontinued the increase and she put me on some BuSpar.

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/switching-klonopin-librium-3449865.html,Considering switching from Klonopin to Librium?,"Hi. This is my first post, so forgive any mistakes. I've been on a high dose of various benzos for almost 23 years. I've been diagnosed with GAD, PTSD, Borderline Personality Disorder, OCD, and panic attacks. I used to drink a 6-pack of beer daily to help with my symptoms, but my doctor told me alcohol will not work long-term to treat my symptoms. I started on 4 Mg/day of Xanax 23 years ago. Xanax worked wonders for me, but unfortunately, after 10 years, Xanax became ineffective. The Xanax used to make me feel very happy (I also suffer from major depression). When the Xanax quit working, I was admitted into the psych ward where a new Dr put me on 3.5 Mg/day of Klonopin (I take generic clonazepam). When I was first prescribed Xanax, I was also prescribed 150 Mg/day of Zoloft. The Zoloft did nothing for my depression. All it did was make me throw up 2 to 3 times a day, grind my teeth, put electric shock sensations through my brain, and caused a permanent thing called Tardive Dyskinesia, which makes me unable to stop moving certain muscles, and my face is now in a permanent grimace. I've tried ALL the SSRI's, and the newer SNRI's (Mirtazapine was worst-I couldn't even speak when on that drug and developed uncontrollable shaking and extreme angry outbursts), but they all caused the nausea, teeth grinding, and other unpleasant side effects. Even tried the old tricyclic (Elavil, etc) antidepressants with no success. I've seen 4 GP's, and they have all said I will likely be on benzos for the rest of my life. Now, here's my question: Xanax made me feel VERY happy and I had absolutely no depression while on them (10 years). Since I've been on the clonazepam, I get more and more depressed every day. I'm seeing my psychiatrist in a month, and am considering asking to be switched over to Librium. I've researched the side effects of various benzos, and depression is listed as a side effect of clonazepam, while Librium does not list depression as a side effect. Does anyone here have experience with long term Librium use, and if it caused depression? I read through many of the reviews of Librium here on this site, but most were relating to alcohol withdrawals, and a few relating to anxiety, and no-one mentioned depression as a side effect of Librium. I'm hoping someone has some experience with this medication. I don't want to slip further into this horrible depression, which coincidentally started when I was switched from Xanax to Klonopin. I should also mention that during my trial of Xanax and other benzos, I tried 40 Mg/day of Valium (I think they were 10 Mg-they were round, light blue, scored tablets, but the Valium also made me feel extremely depressed, to the point of tears. Ativan worked somewhat, but turned me into a zombie that would fall asleep anywhere. A few details about myself. I'll be 60 in a few years. I used to own a 6 bedroom home on an acreage which I lost in divorce. I haven't been able to work for 23 years, and live on a small disability pension. I do not have a home anymore. Rents here are $1800/month for a 1 bedroom apartment, and I only get $960 a month on my pension, so I'm going between living in my car, and couch-surfing when I can. This life in itself is enough to cause depression, but at least the Xanax made me not care and I was happy. Hoping Librium can be my savior. Thanks for any and all advice! "

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/continue-generic-lexapro-switch-over-zoloft-3465990.html,Should I continue with generic Lexapro or switch over to Zoloft?,"I was first prescribed generic Lexapro at 5mg for anxiety by my doctor on November 8, 2018 and have been taking it ever since. I was on 5mg for a month before she upped my dosage to 10mg which I have been on since December 7, 2018. Before my doctor prescribed me the 10mg, I described to her how I was feeling and how I had come to determine based off my newfound understanding of Relationship OCD that I had it and that the thoughts and behaviors I was experiencing were in line with OCD. My doctor being a regular doctor and not a specialist over OCD couldn't tell me anything on OCD but did ask if I wanted to be referred to a psychiatrist. I let her know that at the time that wasn't the direction I wanted to go just yet. Well fast forward to a month later and I'm still at the 10mg but honestly I don't feel that I feel any much better with my anxiety and OCD thoughts. Sometimes it doesn't feel so bad but compared to how I was expecting to feel on this medicine especially after reading other's experiences on this website about how it completely transformed their lives, it's a bit discouraging. Granted I've read that most people who deal with OCD need a much higher dosage of medicine, but I don't know, at the same time I don't want to get myself carried away because I would like to be able to manage it without medicine at some point so I don't want to up my dosage too much. My concern about switching over to Zoloft is that the side effects will be much worse. The only consistent side effect I've felt with generic lexapro is the tired/drowsy feeling, but switching over to taking it at night has helped me a lot. So because it hasn't reached 3 months yet, I'm trying to be patient with it and give it a chance, but I'm contemplating on whether or not I should up my dosage to 15mg or switch to Zoloft. Any experience you've had with these meds would be greatly appreciated. Also, keep in mind that with either of these meds, I'll have to be taking the generic version of them because my insurance doesn't cover them. The name brand version would cost me over $300 a month.

Mom is diagnosed OCD, ADD, mild retardation and schizophrenia. He is slightly developmentally delayed and showed obvious signs of ADHD at around 4 years old but is an overall loving and eager to please child. He was prescribed Procentra to help with the ADHD to help prevent any further delay once in Pre-K. Later, around 5 years of age, he began a serious attachment disorder to my husband. To the point that he has severe anxiety if he isn't with him-to beginning to show anger and agression. He has seen a psychiatrist since he was 4 for precautionary and developmental reasons, so she prescribed him Valproic Acid (Depakene liquid) in a small dosage amount of 1/2 tsp twice a day to help with the mood swings and aggression since it was often shown to us parents and other children at daycare. After a short period he began showing serious aggression, growling, anger, talked of how we were mad at him all the time, showed more anxiety, stomping, snarling, talking of hitting us, then to immediate crying and saying he was sorry.

My only guess would be some sort of extraocular hyper-fatigue sort of deal.

He was young when he started taking 5mg of Adderall to help him focus when he started school. I know it was young, but he just wasn't able to focus at school and my Mom did not put my brother on meds and he ended up basically only getting a 6th year education. yes, the system is better and protects kids from that happening now, but I didn't want my son to hate school. He also had some severe OCD habits, but I waited hoping they would resolve on their own w/out meds. they didnt and it started interfering with his ability to sleep and get ready for school in the mornings... we spent most bedtimes and mornings in tears so i felt it was time. they put him on Paxil and honestly, I never questioned it. I have taken zoloft on and off for years with no adverse issues that i KNOW of, but I have so many health issues now along with depression and anxiety and Ive found out that these medications do alter our chemical processes in our brain and body and sometimes it is permanent. Now, he has some weird anxietys that are keeping him from enjoying his life as a teenager and I wonder, was he too young to have meds changing his chemical make up? did they alter a system that needed to be left alone in order for him to grow up and think correctly... Im just a concerned parent and want to do what is right for him. Ive taken a lot of flack over the years for putting him on adderall so young... accusations that I did it for me, because he was so hyper and active... mostly I ignored them because if they were relevant to my life they would have known Ive never given him his meds on the weekends of holidays when home with me... I enjoy his personality and truthfully dislike that the adderall calms him down as well as helps his focus... he isint himself, he isnt as funny... or as sociable, but when I allowed him to try and go to school without it, he is the one who asked me to start giving it to him again. same thing with the Paxil a few months ago..he felt down and depressed and like his OCD was getting worse. Again, it does help those areas of his life, but it does change his personality somewhat... should I be trying something different? Is there a reason why they give adolescents Paxil over other choices? If anyone has any information on this subject, or helpful advice, please reply as i really need to be reassured that this is the right choice for him. thanks in advance! "

I was on it for about 6 months, beginning with 20mg and gradually increasing to about 80mg (a high does of prozac is recommended for ocd). Well it did improve my ocd symptoms, but not enough to where I wanted to be on it long term. I began tapering off the prozac for a few weeks, then my doctor said that because prozac has a long half time life and I was only on it for 6 months I could completely stop. It has been about 5 weeks since I have been completely off prozac and I have noticed some changes and I am wondering if it is due to coming off Prozac. For example I am more irritable and moody. My OCD is also at an all time high, worse than before I ever began the medication. My main concern is I have noticed quite a bit of weight gain ever since I got off the medication. While on the prozac I gained a couple pounds (I wouldn't even blame the prozac) but after coming off nothing has changed yet the scale continues to rise and it feels impossible to lose. I was never depressed before, but this continuous weight gain has me discouraged, unmotivated and ultimately feeling depressed. Does coming off the prozac mess with your metabolism?

Does paroxetine have the same onset?,"I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety disorder and OCD (dermatillomania). The doctor started a treatment with escitalopram. I took 5 mg during three days and had hot flashes, panic, dilated pupils, racing thoughts, depersonalization (this scared me A LOT). It was hell, I felt on the edge of a panic attack all day long. Even when I took half of the dose, 3.5 mg this happened. She gave me xanax so I could cope with the onset but I couldn't continue. After I quit everything returned to normal. Next time I saw her she told me that I couldn't take lextor anymore, that I should continue with xanax. I just took 0.5 mg or 0.25 mg once in a while when I was feeling too nervous. But nothing that I couldn't manage without it. This happened during november. Last week I had a personal situation that made my anxiety blow through the roof. I got really hypochondriac, feeling my body, my breath, my heartbeats. I started to take xanax again (just 0.5 in the morning, where I get really nervous). I saw my therapist and told me that I should check with the doctor to switch to clonazepam (longer duration). When I called her she told me that I was already taking an anxiolytic and that 'I should take something else'. I'm terrified by this because I know the other drug she could try (she told me) is paroxetine and I'm afraid that I can't deal with it. My anxiety went down with my psychologist, and I'm already feeling better but now I'm scared of this.  Does Paroxetine has the same onset as Escitalopram? Is there any other treatment choices for GAD?. Thank you. PS: I don't have any type of issue with sleeping. I sleep perfectly well. They asked me this a thousand times. I'm not having panic attacks either. "

Would lexapro work 4 ocd,I was on celexa for 11 years for anxiety/OCD. In 2011 my anxiety got very bad. I stayed on celexa but upped the dosage from 40mg to 60mg. I was also prescribed Wellbutrin 100mg and gabapentin 100mg 4 times a day. The celexa was reduced to 40mg and I stayed on those until November 2014.

Can I just stop taking it?,"Has anyone taken baclofen experienced what they thought might be an allergic reaction to it? I'm not sure if its the baclofen or something else, but I have been experiencing severe itching, wheezing, fogginess, & swelling in my face, hands, ankles & feet which has gotten much worse recently, to the point that I went to the ER a few weeks ago, but by the time I got there the swelling had gone down, my blood pressure & EKG was normal and they did not think I was having an allergic reaction, at least not at the present time. They looked at my medications & didn't seem to think any of them could be causing what I informed them I was experiencing. They couldn't get an IV started bc I have very difficult veins, so they werent able to do any blood work to see if I had a possible infection or if the cells that respond to histamine were high, ect. But they didn't seem to think there was anything wrong. I was short of breath, but not having difficulty breathing in their eyes. Well since then the swelling has been reoccuring & the itching & wheezing has gotten worse. I saw an allergist & the worst reactions I had for what they tested for was environmental things like tree pollen, and mold, so he wanted me to start a mold elimination diet which I have been following for a couple weeks but have only been getting worse. He said the swelling I was experiencing (I had pictures that I showed to him) looked more like a reaction to medications than to food or pollen, but when researching my meds didn't think that any of them should cause that. So I don't know if its a combination of my meds or one in particular that could be causing this, but I keep a food, med, & symptoms journal & it seems to me that everything got worse when I came off of my steriod medication (at doctor's request to test to autoimmune type illness.) I had been taking the steriod med for ""neurocardiogenic syncope"" which we are yet to find the cause or trigger. But since then my other meds have been increased to try to control the pain & muscle spasms I experience. I started baclofen & morphine sulfate in addition to what I was already taking: Norco, Pristiq, & Klonopin. I recently was diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency and put back on a steriod medication. I also had the baclofen & morphine sulfate dosages increased and it seems like I have gotten even worse since then, hence my concern that I may be reacting to the combination of medicines or just one & it seems to correlate with the start & increase of baclofen & morphine sulfate. I know stopping the morphine sulfate ubruptly would cause horrible withdraws, but was wondering if I could just stop the baclofen & see if that helps? I also take seroquel, forgot to list that one, and it is fairly recent too. I am just really confused with taking all these meds (phenergan too, I have severe nausea). I just don't what is causing this allergy type reaction & inflammation. But it is scaring me, I am so sick & I don't know what to do. And none of my doctors seem to know either! :( "

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/lexapro-escitalopram-side-effects-due-wrong-dose-3167631.html,Lexapro escitalopram side effects due to wrong dose.( Anxiety / Depression)?,"Hi All,  4 weeks of trying to battle with mild depression, anxiety and repetitive thoughts without them I finally gave in and I started taking escitalopram ( Lexapro) but under a different brand name 10 mg two weeks ago.  To begin with I messed up the way I took my meds.   I started taking by taking 10 Mg the first time at night 14 days ago but the next day I felt very anxious and lightheaded. I then got anxious about taking them and did not take the dose again the following night. After I spoke to my dr who said take one again at lunch the next day Tuesday which I did and I felt great almost immediately within an hour of taking it I could concentrate I was smiling and very positive.  That night I made a mistake and thought I would take 5mg half of one pill to make up for the previous night where I had missed my dose of 10Mg I did not consult my Dr on this I just thought it would be ok. I went to sleep and woke up having a terrible panic attack.  I spoke to my doc in the morning of Wednesday who said take another whole 10mg at 12 Pm then start taking them in the morning after this. I have now been taking the 10mg every morning at 0800 for the past 10 days at this time I have felt very little change in how I am feeling. I actually started getting side effects such as anxiety in the mornings and throughout the day, sweaty, tingling hands and shaky hands, loss of sex drive and not being able to concentrate or sleep well. These are all the opposite of how I felt when I started taking the pills in the first two days where I felt much better.  My problem is I now think that by taking that extra dose of 5 mg at night and having the panic attack I over stimulated my brain by starting the medication in the wrong way and I have really effected how the drugs are working on me now and causing a lot of worry in my mind.  Do you think the way I initially started taking the meds have effected how they are working on me now by missing a dose then taking half of a dose?  The main reason I think this is because when I first took them I felt great and then that feeling went away after I took the 5mg dose.  I know many people say they take between 2- 4weeks to start to take effect but it has been two weeks now and I have not felt much difference.  Any answers or feedback on the above would be great.  Thanks "

I have been suffering from depression most of my life but wasn't diagnosed until 1992. My psychiatrist said I have dysthymia and OCD. He put me on Anafranil, which I took for about 10 years. Then I took Prozac 80mg / day until 2013, when I switched to Effexor 75mg / day. I took that for about 3 years and it helped, but I experienced severe, crippling headaches at least once a week. The headaches would start in the middle of the night and include nausea. At first, I thought they were sinus related, as they were toward the front of my head. Nothing helped; not Tylenol nor ibuprofen, and I also tried Flonase.  So I'm off the Effexor and now have the old depression back. The headaches are gone, but not sure what is worse -- headaches or depression. Have others experienced headaches with Effexor? Any solutions or alternatives?  Thanks. "

My OB was aware that I was also diagnosed with anxiety and that I had received an OCD diagnosis from one therapist and a PTSD diagnosis from another so she put me on Zoloft. Since I have been on Zoloft I have felt like I am losing my mind. I have thoughts that just kind of barge in and severe anxiety attacks lasting hours at night to the point I want to go to the ER or be admitted just so I know there are doctors nearby if I need them. I have had nausea, kind of an out of it feeling all the time, teeth grinding, persistent headaches, and the anxiety has triggered some of my colitis/ibs problems. I am scared to talk to my fiance in fear that something I don't mean will slip out since I'm having intrusive thoughts. It's horrible and I am TERRIFIED!! Anyway, I told her and another Dr that I am having a hard time with the medication and they botg told me to come off of it immediately after 6 nights of continued use and that I shouldn't have any withdrawal symptoms. Tonight is my first night not taking it (it's been about 28 hrs since my last dose) and here I am again having all the same problems! I just want to know when I will get my mind back and if I've caused long-term damage.

I have OCD that brings on intrusive thoughts, repetitive thought patterns that brutalize my mental state. I also suffer with a feeling of on edge anxiety most of the time, and most recently noticed I’m starting to feel agoraphobic and when discussing with my doctor he said the symptoms I describe were pretty spot on. I tried a few other meds prior and they made things so much worse. I believe I’m very sensitive to anti-depressants. Then I was prescribed 20 mg of Prozac and it was amazing. It stopped the intrusive thoughts it helped me in every way and for once didn’t give me any initial troubles. However, I ran out after about maybe 2 years or so and started back up after a few weeks to months and again it felt so much better. Well I ended up in the habit again and with school and work was not able to refill my prescription. Finally after 3-4 months I got the ok and went to my pharmacy. However, this time they changed the manufacture and when I took it I had terrible feelings of anxiety levels and insomnia with my ocd coming back and it lasted for 2.5 weeks.

This was getting out of control, so I decided to stop it with the suboxone treatment and deal with the neck surgery. Went to see one of those ""cash-only"" doctors, who also insisted that I should pay cash for the med, as well (!). My hydros were insurance covered, so I didn't care for the projected nearly $600 cash every month. He prescribed 8 mg tapes, twice a day for a daily total of 16 mg for one week to start. This is when I started reading more about the med, so the cost, plus learning that its withdrawal can be very extended by comparison to hydros, I did not like that, just too many reasons not to do it, but without really enough info, unfortunately. So, after only three days of the prescribed twice a day 8 mg tapes, I decided to go the 4th day at half a tape (4 mg) twice a day, for a total 8 mg for the day) and felt just fine. The 5th day I went to only a 1/4 of a tape (2 mg) twice a day, for a total of 4 mg. for the day and felt just fine. The 6th day I only took one 1/4 (2 mg) and that was that, still feeling just fine. At this point I was mistakenly making comparisons with hydros, like: ""who can possibly get physically addicted to anything with only three days of full prescription and a total of 5 1/2 days use""?  It took about three more days to confront reality. On the 4th day after I quit, I started to feel sick. Well, it's been 10 days now since I took the last 2 mg and I'm wondering whether this is ever going to end. It is nothing like the wild withdrawals from stopping the hydros of that pre-Sub start requirement, but it still bad enough to totally interfere with my life.  I'm sure hoping for a word of hope that the end should be near. How can taking ONLY HALF OF ONE WEEK prescription stay in your system for so long, much longer than the time I took the Sub itself. I've endured so many days that I don't want to go back to taper. I just want to know when can I expect the end to this. Thanks "

Opiate Withdrawal,https://www.drugs.com/answers/been-on-30mg-of-methadone-for-90-days-how-bad-266293.html,Been on 30mg of methadone for 90 days. How bad would the withdrawals be quitting cold turkey ?,"Hey everybody, I'm 31 years old. Throughout my twenties I've messed around with alot of different drugs, and since I was about 26 years old I have quit different drugs. All cold turkey. Pot, alochol, and cocaine.I was up to easily an 8 ball a day before I quit cocaine cold turkey. Painkillers though never posed as a problem for me then. Took vicotin or loritabs here and there for recreation. If I was on it for too long I just quit and feel like crap for 3 or 4 days and be done with it, then I found Roxys. Started off taking a half of a 15mg cause it was too strong. Eventually I got a tolerance to the point that I was taking 120-150mg a day, Didn't take long to reach that. Couple months maybe. Knew at that point I wanted to quit. Tried quitting cold turkey and the withdrawals were viciously hell! Tried tapering the Roxys but couldn't get it down past 90mg. Even tried loritabs as an alternative to taper throught the withdrawals. Was no different than taking tylenol. Finally found methadone and was glad for it. Started off at 30mg and it made me feel comfortable for a few hours before I started feeling the aches and withdrawals but they were so much less intense. Was just enough for me to get out of bed and somewhat function throughout the day and work. Wasn't feeling great by all means but was functioning. So I stayed on it and gave it a week to see if it got better. Didn't want to go up cause I knew the higher I went the harder and longer it be to get off. After a week or so it got better and now I feel fine throughout the whole day on 30mg. Now I'm to the point that I got control of my life again. I'm taking care of myself and want to fulfill my goal of being totally drug free. Eventhough methadone gave me my life back, it's still an opiate and won't feel totally clean until I'm off of it too. I know there are other methods like tapering and suboxone etc., but methadone is also getting to expensive for me, so I first want to try and get off of it completely and quit cold turkey. I feel I have the motivation and will to quit cold turkey and want to do it that way. Plus I'm not on a strong dose of methadone, but been online reading about people that were successful and unsuccessful quitting cold turkey. Wondering why some people can and some people can't? Is it the people on high doses or dependent on methadone a long time the ones struggling to quit cold turkey, or does it not matter how long or how high a dose you take? And if anybody knows how strong and what kind of withdrawals I will feel after taking 30mg for 90days I'd really love to know? Also if anybody here quit cold turkey, how did you do it, and how did it make you feel? Sorry it's alot of questions, but ready to quit and want to make sure I know everything to prepare myself.

Opiate Withdrawal,https://www.drugs.com/answers/i-am-done-with-methadone-i-left-some-advice-who-359130.html,I am DONE with Methadone. I left some advice. Who ever WANTS to quit this slavery!?,"... My last drink was 4 days ago. Today I slept till 4am then had a hot shower and passed out again. I dont have any mussle spasm and restless legs whats so ever. The only thing I feel is extreme sweating. Thats pritty much it. Just to note I didint even take clonidine before I went to bed. As an advice to anyone who want to get out of this physical slavery! Taper down depending on your own body. But usualy people taper from 100 mils and up-10 mils a week. Starting from 45mils lower 5mils a week. But remember you have to feel your body yourself. If you see you are too sick(having restless legs,agony etc) Figure out the ways with your doc. And at the same time if you eat right, you are young, used meth no longer then 3-4 years and you see that your body gets adapted faster then 7 days. Tell your docotor to make 45 for example until thursday and 40 after after. Dont let your doctor figure out how fast you should lower. Because I dont know in States but in Canada doctors are not really interested that you quit. They want there money. Thats why they are always so happy to raise your dose. Me personally I went from 35 mils to 0 in about a month and half. Sounds like a long time. But Its VERY short. My case was a little unique. I was cutting my dose 5 mills every two days. Up to 12 Mils. Thats when it slowed down. every two days I was lowering like 3 mills at a time. It is very importent to expect some sickness. Me personally I couldnt take restless legs at night. So sweating yawning didnt really bother me much as long as I could sleep at night. It is Very importent to eat RIGHT. Dont eat red meat! as its promoting more pain in your mussles. Eat ALOTS of protein(fish, chicken,duck,), fibers, fruits, vegetables. If you have hard time eating, drink shakes, multivitamines. And I am dead serious when you eat right everyday, you will notice that you feel so much better after you ate. And feel so shit when you are hungry. Also its very importent to have psysical activity. Even if you have no energy just do push ups, or walking. Actualy its winter now, it feels really shit outside BUT its actualy makes your mussle shorten, and promotes opiat receptors in your body to start working again. How to Kill anxiety? Gym, sauna, hot shower,sex(right hand whichever works:) ) Are great tools to kill the anxiety and relax your mussles. From chemicals. I would recommend clonidine. As its the only thing I used, and find it very helpfull if you cant fall asleep. If you feel like after you done your shower, exercise, and took a clonidine and you still have restless legs, means you lowered too fast. But dont get confused. Its ALOTS in your head. When I was using, I was hearing these things its all in your head etc I was getting mad(thinking you stupid idiots dont understand anything) But its actually is a fact. Its VERY importent to keep yourself occupied. Dont sit in your room while withdrawing. As its gonna bring you to the point where you feel like you dont know what else to do, running from one corner to another raising your anxiety and chance to relapse. Its very importen to do something different then you did when you used. As its gonna show like a new begining for you. Find new interest, what ever it is. Plan your day from the evening. For example I wasnt working so I had so much time free when was withdrawing(and still do) So plan something like that. I run in the morning, then go home cook breakfast, then chill, then go to gym, take a shower. Then start cooking dinner. After dinner chill, then go to sauna. When come back smoke a spliff, watch a movie prepare for bed. Thats an example of a very lazy person! :) If you find yourself feel anxious, cant sit still, Just go outside walk for a bit. U will get frozen, and when you come back you will be far more relaxed. Also its very importent to have notebook. Where you can clearly express your feelings at this moment. Also its also importen to write down all the negatives and positives of using(usualy there is not positives) Write down your worth withdrawal, how it felt. Write down what kind of person you want to become. Its importen to have short term goals while withdrawing. For example by the end of this week I will be on 30 mils then after you are done, write down the exact things you want to achive. MAKE em achivable, dont write something you cant do yet. Its very importent after you quit. To find new interest or hobby as soon as you can. As its gonna show you new begining, and keep your mind happy and occupied with a new interest. It could be ANYTHING. If you feel like using again Just take your notebook And read what you actually felt and how painfull it was. Its very importent to write it down, because through time your body forgets how painfull it is. Also expect any brainflipps and temptetions. Just take em with a smile and just say to yourself its just a test to see how strong I am, And just say no! you wont suck me in this painfull slavery again! Helps to think that its just devil talking throught another person(if someone asks you to use) Also importent to cut your ""friends"" so called u used with, and delete the numbers of dealers. You cant run away from them all ur life, you have to learn how to say""no"" I am stronger and smarter then that! But at the early stages while your body and mind weak, it might be hard so dont try. I almost relapsed that way! Also helps to feel sad for those people who are still on. Just think of them as slaves of there own body! Learn to hate your drug. Find things that are negative(shouldnt be hard) and I am sure you wont find any positive other then running away from your own self, (which is NOT positive)! I really hope this helps. I dont think I am gonna have time to help people on a forum. So people who helped me before(christine, mpvt, chacne4real life) If you find this info usefull Fill it with your own ideas and make like ecouregment for other people) Thank you so much for all the advice These guys REALLY CARE. So if any Q. ask em, they will be happy to answer. So am I, if you dont mind. Good luck with fighting evil, And take care of yourself. Remember relapse is very common. And its SO much more harder to quit second time. Also if you use even once! after you quit. It will make you addicted the same way as you have been. Even worse. And you r gonna have much less willpower. Make sure you are READY to quit. But it doesnt mean you have to find excuses for yourself not to quit! Good luck! "

I was finally able to afford to go see the Dr and my obgyn in Mid January. I started on Junel after much discussion, and it seemed to work for about 3 weeks. I had a little break through bleeding. This pack had only 3 weeks, so I thought I was suppose to have a rest week then continue use, as explained in my packet(later my dr explained she wanted me on continual no breaks, I wasn't suppose to have any period at all for now). So about Mid February on Valentines day weekend I had an incapacitate episode of extreme pain, Extreme bleeding with constant large clots (Had to where a tampon, a pad and an adult diaper). I was going through tampons on the 1/2 hr, and pads on the hr. I'd have to where extra protection to not make a mess. It slowly stopped after 2 weeks, I went back to my primary and obgyn. They both said I should had gone to the ER. She told me to continue taking the Junel, I did. Had browning throughout march, Pinking and a lot of pain throughout april, and went back to my obygyn to discuss the continual breakthrough bleeding and pains I was having some days it's still incapacitating. I had another bleeding episode in the beginning of May and it was accompanied with dizziness this time as well as pain. Went to the ER this round, they could find nothing wrong with me as far as blood test go,The Dr said and I quote""on paper you are a perfectly healthy human being"" so I got sent home with the advice of keep taking my new pill, and IB profrin for pain. She also told me sometimes women experience this for 6 months before their bodies regulate out normal.There are many who have worse situations than me and not to worry. I have been tested by by dr and obgyn and nothing abnormal is showing up, nothing at all, vitals are perfect. I have had an ultrasound,It is clear. I am having a hard time functioning like this. I have a very physical job as a massage therapist and they are doing all they can to keep me. I suppose my question is, anyone else experience this kind of bleeding? Is it normal to wait? Will my body regulate out after 6 months on this new pill sprintec? I am only 6 Days on it and my bleeding is on going and occasionally painful.The bleeding is not as severe as my February episode but that's why I went to the ER so it wouldn't get that way. In the end my ERdr told me everyones body is different and this is just how yours is functioning... I don't have answers and I don't know were to go to further explore this, I can't function like this. I really want to avoid a hysterectomy but at this point I don't care.

I think I wasn't having the emotional problems during summer because I was stress free! But now that I am back in school I am feeling the stress again. Recently (before school started) my doctor recommended that we lower my dose of prednisone to half a tablet (I think that is about 10mg, I was on one 20mg tablet for about 3 months to keep my cough down and help with the Sinusitis) and a week after that I began to feel sick again, with headaches, body aches, and my cough returned. Now I am on two 20mg tablets of Prednisone a day, and am feeling very emotionally unstable, can not focus, very irritable, throwing up, and I still feel sick. I have been home for 8 days now which really sucks because now my school work is slowly piling up.

Migraine Prevention,https://www.drugs.com/answers/clonazepam-10years-14yrs-prescribed-2239718.html,I have been on clonazepam for more than 10years. More like about 14yrs. It was prescribed to me by?,"my GP. I am 56yrs old. I have been on short term then LTD and now Canada Disability Pension over past 4 years. My Dr. d/c'd a few of my medications and lowered the dose of one, but until my daughter sent me info on Long Term Side Effects of Clonazepam I had no idea and am not sure why my Dr.  had no idea that at least 85% of those side effects applied to me. My dose was 4mg. After reading this info and doing my own research, I went to see my Dr. and told her I wanted to withdrawal from Clonazepam. She told me to go down by 1/2mg every 2 weeks until I was done. I told her I would rather discontinue it at my own rate which she agreed to. I did decrease by 1/2 mg every two weeks until I reached 2mg . Once I reached the 2mg point I started having the first significant withdrawal symptoms since the beginning.  Insomnia, restless legs ( which I was aware would return either as a symptom of withdrawal or because it was the reason I was on this med ), general feeling of lethargy, flu like symptoms, nausea, & light sensitivity. I think insomnia was the biggest. I began taking melatonin for sleep which is actually recommended for insomnia from benzo withdrawals. Since then I have been having headaches, so I'm not sure if it is the last decrease or the melatonin ( which I will stop taking for a few days to see if the headaches go away ). Because of the symptoms I am going to stay at 2mg for an extra week or two. My goal once I get thru this first hurdle is to decrease by 10% of my dose until I am off of Clonazepam completely. I am sure there will be more hurdles in my future, but my question for those of you who know or have been through this, is if there are things I can do to ease the side effects? Can anyone suggest help with the insomnia, and/or the restless legs, which are really the worst right now. No sleep or barely any ( likely about 12hrs over past 5-6 days ) is horrible. I turn the TV off, try drinking a warm drink at bedtime as suggested to me, have tried the melatonin which does help induce sleep, but for 2hrs max , and I am not sure if it is causing the headaches yet. Having my legs "" crawl "" is an agonizing thing and I had forgotten how horrible until I started decreasing the medication I was taking to prevent this. I literally had holes in the bottom of all of my sheets until I started taking the Clonazepam many years ago ( and we did try Mirapex, but due to side effects could not take it either ). Any suggestions to make this process somewhat easier ( I don't expect an easy withdrawal, and I am aware the worst is yet to come as the doses get smaller ). I am just looking for some ways which I may make the transition somewhat less difficult.  I lost my job after 32 years, I've lost friends, family members and about the last six years of my life because of this medication. My husband really still does not understand the difficulties caused not to mention what I have yet to get to as my clonazepam dose decreases. It truly has been life changing. "

For the past 5 years, I've had unbearable (and undiagnosed) neuropathic type pain from my butt to my feet, and also a bit in my wrists. It has turned my life from having to sit or lay most of the time, to having to lie down almost all the time, as it's too painful to sit. Even then, i am in terrible pain 24/7. Lying down so much has also resulted in much more body pain as well. My Dr thinks I have Chronic Pain Syndrome, and a rheumatologist diagnosed me with Fibromyalgia.

Obesity,https://www.drugs.com/answers/topamax-eating-disorder-binge-eating-bulimia-2885782.html,Topamax for eating disorder (binge eating/bulimia)?,"Hello everyone. This is my first post here and I really need your support and your experience. I've been suffering from eating disorder for 6 years now (1 year anorexia, 5 years binge and bulimia).  I've been put on Topamax 100 mg for binge eating/bulimia and it's only one month since I started taking it. I know I have to wait but I didn't noticed anything but depression, anger, restlessness. I still binge, I'm still very hungry, I work out but I hate it and feel more frustrated than ever.  This is my real second time on Topamax, but actually it's the forth time on this drug. Six years ago I took Topamax just for a month, three years ago I took it for two years, then for less than a month and now it's been a month. I don't take into account the first and the third time because they were just a month.  The second time I took Topamax, it worked quite good. I got rid of 44lbs and this helped me a lot building some social life and living again. But the side effects were a high price to pay: I experienced memory loss, dizziness, I couldn't speak properly. In addition, I gained and lost pounds several times because, after the first months, I started binging again. But my weight was normal so I could do other things. I could have a life. But after two years I decided to quit Topamax because my obsession about food was unbearable as well as the inability to study. I gained all the weight back, even if I was working out, I was binging less, I was (and still am) eating more healthy. I'm back to a situation that I can't stand. I'm overweight again, I'm depressed, I think I'm not worth anything.  So I got back to my psychiatrist who gave me topamax again but after a month I'm still binging, more depressed and frustrated than before.  Has anyone ever taken Topamax for more than once? How about weight loss if taken for the second or even third time? I'm afraid it won't work this time :( Tell me about your experience on Topamax. Thank you all :) "

Opiate Dependence,https://www.drugs.com/answers/wanted-share-article-you-607124.html,Wanted to share this article with you all?,"Some chronic pain patients, particularly in Florida, are finding it difficult to fill their oxycodone prescriptions at their local pharmacies. Pharmacists are telling them they don't have any oxycodone. But is that true? Maybe, maybe not.   Technically, according to the DEA, there is no shortage of oxycodone. Pharmaceutical companies are producing it at normal levels. What is in short supply are pharmacists who are willing and able to fill your prescription.   Here's the Story...    Florida has had a huge problem with unscrupulous doctors prescribing and often also dispensing large quantities of opioids, primarily oxycodone, from storefront operations commonly called “pill mills.” According to a 2011 NPR report, doctors in Florida were prescribing 10 times more oxycodone than all the other U.S. states combined.   In an effort to curb this oxy epidemic, the DEA began cracking down not only on Florida doctors, but also on pharmacies and wholesale drug distributors in the state. Earlier this year, they suspended Cardinal Health, the nation's second-largest drug distributor, from selling and shipping controlled substances from it's Lakeland, Florida facility for two years. They also suspended the controlled substances licenses of two CVS pharmacies in Sanford, Florida. The reason for the suspensions in both cases was for selling excessive amounts of oxycodone.   A Chilling Effect    While the primary focus of this crackdown was Florida, the DEA actions have had a chilling effect on pharmacies and distributors in some other states as well. For example, the DEA's enforcement actions have reportedly tightened the distribution supply. And some pharmacies are choosing not to carry oxycodone and other controlled substances at all.    Basically, these actions have a trickle-down effect. At each level, companies and individuals are required to monitor and report problems down the line.   Distributors are expected to monitor, report and even cut off pharmacies who order too many opioids. Pharmacies are expected to monitor, report and even refuse to fill prescriptions from doctors who prescribe too many opioids. Pharmacists are also expected to evaluate patients and refuse to fill prescriptions for opioids if they suspect something is not quite right.   It's no wonder doctors are deciding not to prescribe and pharmacies are deciding not to sell opioid pain killers. It's just not worth the risk for them.   But where does that leave chronic pain patients? Officials say their actions are not meant to harm legitimate pain patients. They say their only purpose is to cut down on drug abuse. But the fact is, their actions sometimes do harm us – a lot. Every time a doctor or pharmacy decides it's too risky or too much trouble to prescribe or sell opioid medications, chronic pain patients suffer. Simply put, chronic pain patients are collateral damage in the war on drugs.  Back to my initial question – if your pharmacist tells you they don't have any oxycodone, are they telling you the truth?   Amy Pavuk, a reporter with the Orlando Sentinal, spoke with Paul Doering, a professor at the University of Florida's College of Pharmacy. He told her that when pharmacists can't or are not comfortable filling a prescription, they take the path of least resistance. ""They will simply wash their hands of the situation by saying 'I'm sorry, we don't have this,' Doering said, “Whether you do or don't have it, [the customer] will never know."" What You Can Do   Although there is no way to guarantee you won't find yourself in this situation, there are a few things you can do that may help minimize the possibility.   If possible, use only one pharmacy for all of your prescriptions. Be honest about your medical and prescription history. Pharmacists can check your prescription history in your state's prescription-drug-monitoring database. If they find that you've been dishonest, you will become suspect and they may refuse to fill your prescription.  Get to know your pharmacist and let him/her get to know you. This is often easier to do with a small, privately-owned pharmacy rather than a big chain pharmacy.  Watch your refill dates and don't try to refill an opioid medication early. It will only raise suspicions – and you won't get your medication early. Refills of controlled substances are strictly regulated.   Your Experience   Have you had trouble filling a prescription for oxycodone in the past year? (There was a true oxycodone shortage in 2009 but that was not related to this current problem.) If so, what did your pharmacist tell you? Do you live in Florida or another state? "

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/long-before-feeling-back-normal-after-stopping-3332261.html,How long before feeling back to normal after stopping sertraline??,"I was on Sertraline for about 2 years & 4 months for panic attacks, anxiety, OCD disturbing thoughts & some depression (caused by the panic attacks) I was very reluctant to take anything since I am into more natural remedies but after trying everything I could for months I decided to take the medicine. Thank God Sertraline worked great for most all of my symptoms! I was on 100mg for about a year & then 50mg for the 2nd year & weaned down to 25mg and then weaned very very slowly over 2-3 months. Fast forward to now I think I stopped taking my last little piece about 3 months ago. I learned a lesson here-ALWAYS keep track of the day you officially stop your medicine lol. I think it's been 3 month but it could be 2 or 4 months now. Anyway I am feeling VERY depressed since stopping but not 24/7 it is very back & forth & just feeling not myself at all-crazy is the best word that comes to mind lol. No panic attacks thank God & Anxiety is not as bad but def back some with some OCD thoughts & alot of disassociation. My question is are these normal symptoms of coming off the sertraline? (Not while you are tapering off but after you stop taking it all together) & will these symptoms go away & then I will feel like myself OR is this just how I feel now that I am not on my medicine & an indicator that I need to get back on it. I hear mixed answers on how long it takes to fully get out of your system. I am so confused & I really don't want to have to rely on a pill everyday but I also don't want to feel this way it's horrible! I don't want to make the wrong decision & get back on the meds when everything will even out soon & my body will be back in balance OR wait too long to make a decision & continue feeling worse then have to wait for the drug to get back in my system to feel any relief. Get back on the medicine or give it more time?? Any insight is greatly appreciated. "

Opiate Dependence,https://www.drugs.com/answers/i-feel-like-my-life-is-ruined-by-taking-suboxone-362166.html,I feel like my life is ruined by taking suboxone for too long (2 years). My psychiatrist put me on?,"it because he said that my opiate receptors are not working. It sounds ridiculous doesn't it? I found an addiction psychiatrist a couple of months ago when I was down to 2 mgs. of subutex (same thing as suboxone without the naloxone in it). She had me admitted to the hospital immediately and they took me off of the subutex cold turkey and gave me neurontin and clonidine to help me with the withdrawls but I have never been so sick in all my life. I was in the hospital for 11 days and didn't get out of bed for 8 (only to use the bathroom). They released me after 11 days and had me start a day program for depression/anxiety the next day. I was happy to be home but still very sick and my family was supportive but didn't realize how sick I still was. The doctor told me to do things like go food shopping with my husband, go to dinner with my family, etc., plus it was Thanksgiving and Christmas was right around the corner and there were a lot of birthdays in my family and I had to to out to dinner to celebrate. I was home for 5 days and so nauseous that I took a suboxone just to see if that was why I was so sick and my nausea went away and I had lots of energy so I got a lot done that day. I promised myself I would not take anymore and I wish I would have flushed the pills down the toilet immediately but I was stupid and started taking them to get through going to Thanksgiving, dinner's and of course Christmas and even to make it to my class sometimes because I was just too sick and not ready to be in a class like that. I should have stayed in the hospital until I felt better. Now I've been taking 1/2 mg. almost everyday and I finally broke down and told my Mom last week and we went directly to my new psychiatrist for help. I had to make her promise not to tell my husband. We just spent $10,000.00 for me to get off this med and now I've wrecked everything. My husband is a wonderful man but has a very bad temper and if he ever finds out I'm afraid he'll leave me. I'm so afraid that I am right back to where I was when I went into the hospital and I just can't go through that again. My new psychiatrist gave me clonidine and neurontin for during the day but I still get horrible anxiety and have no energy without the suboxone. I promised my Mother that I didn't have anymore pills at home (I gave what I had with me to my psychiatrist and told her I had no more at home). Now, all week I've been taking the 1/2 mg of suboxone because I'm afraid my husband will see how sick I am and wonder what's going on and I have so much to do. Our oldest daughter who moved out 2 years ago with her boyfriend are looking to buy a house and I need to clean up her old room which I was using for storage and now there are bags of everything in there. This past March my dear Father passed away from a very rare type of cancer. He was only 66 years old. My Mother and I both took care of him for 6 months and I relied on those pills to get me through it. I still can't believe he is gone. I was so very close to him and I just keep pushing it out of my mind that he is gone. He knew I was taking the subutex and he wanted me to get off of it and get better. I never in my wildest dreams thought getting off of it was going to be this hard. When I was on it for 9 months I was able to wean myself off of it and everything came back. I really do not like the way the subutex or suboxone makes me feel. That's the problem. It doesn't make me feel. I was always very into music and very social but now I can't feel music and I don't even want to leave the house. I find no enjoyment in anything. I called my old psychiatrist who wanted me to make an appointment to talk to him (he doesn't take insurance so it cost me $160.00 for him to tell me that he prescribed this med to me off label because we had tried every antidepressant and nothing was working but when I told him I had taken hydrocodone sometimes for bad headaches and that it made me feel normal he decided that my problem was my opiate receptors which my new psychiatrist does not believe). He also said that suboxone is very easy to get off of and the reason why I was so sick in the hospital was because I'm like a diabetic who needs insulin and if I do not have the suboxone my body knows it needs it so I get sick. I refuse to stay on this for the rest of my life but can't get off of it. I did read somewhere that switching to another narcotic (maybe the hydrocodone) for a few weeks can help me to get off the suboxone but my psychiatrist will not give me that and now wants me to attend NA meetings because she thinks I'm an addict. I've been to a lot of meeting but they don't seem to help, plus a lot of the member's there are on suboxone and claim they are clean but all they've done was switch to another narcotic. I do believe that suboxone can be very helpful if someone is abusing narcotics or heroin but they also should be closely monitored and not be on the suboxone for more than a few months and then continue to go to NA meetings. I'm sorry this is so very long. I was thinking about ordering some hydrocodone off the internet but do not want to get in trouble or end up with something like a sugar pill. Has anyone ever ordered off the internet or heard of anyone else doing so and if so, did it turn out ok? Today I took a half mg. of the suboxone and feel ok and thought if I do this for a week then maybe I will be able to stop it again but if not I read somewhere that going back to what you tried first and then weening yourself off (within a couple weeks) can work also. What is tramadol and can that maybe be a substitute for the suboxone? I am so afraid and I just don't think I can handle another 17 + days of that nightmare of a withdrawl and how could I possibly cover that up from my family? Oh, I'm in so much trouble!!! If anyone has any advice I sure would appreciate it. Sincerely, Larsy1966 "

I was on opiates ,morphine, methadone,oxycotin, oxycodone, percocet extra strength for over 4yrs. My life was being destroyed i hated my doctors for destroying my wrist and my unla nerve. 6 nerve block( spinal injections) procedures and i was supposed to be opiate free. the opiates made 16 hrs a day of traction bare able but then ... The physical fight off the opiates was worse then the physical pain from my wrist. Getting of the opiates alone was hell and impossible. My family and friends saw me as weak and lazy. If i took the drugs i was an addict and if i lay in bed i was being lazy and weak. I tried for months to stop the oxy's but the physical body aches, head aches, twitching, tremors, stomach aches, no desire for food no sleep, was soooooo over whelming. I begged the doctors to get me off. They where confident in my strong mind and focus that they up my perscription and said it wasn't time yet. and to slow down. ALL I WANTED WAS MY LIFE BACK pain or no pain. So i went to shake it out and fight the withdrawls full force. BUT it was to strong to powerful no matter how strong my faith, my mind set my determination i couldn't beat it. the opiates where in my body chemistry and i was scared. my blood pressure and heart rate where becoming to high the body ache and sweating was unstopable. i couldn't even look people in the eyes when i talked cause my mouth and eyes would start twitching. i became embarrassed and ashamed of where my life was reguardless of the pain. i found www.opiates.com and began to get educated and started to understand how i needed medical help and needed a doctor to listen.

But I really dont think that is what it is since I never feel the heartburn. Any ideas of what else it could be?

Vomiting,https://www.drugs.com/answers/diarrhea-possibly-side-effect-plan-step-3098571.html,Could diarrhea be a possibly side effect of Plan B One-Step?,I took Plan B One-Step July 24th and had the normal side effects such as vomiting (6hours later after I took it) and headache (yesterday night).

Neuralgia,https://www.drugs.com/answers/gang-anyone-success-tegretol-neuropathic-pain-776347.html,"Hi Gang, Anyone had success with Tegretol for neuropathic pain? Neurologist prescribed this for me?","and I feel a bit leery about it, there are just SO many side effects! And some really scary ones at that. I've been feeling exhausted lately, will Tegretol just exacerbate my exhaustion? I used to be a very high energy person, but no longer, much to my chagrin! My energy has taken off with my sense of humor and both are holding me for ransom! Help, please? My neuropathy has been quite bad. It's stinging, burning, and weird electric shocks. Plus some stabbing pains that I can't explain, either. My Neurologist has said that ALL of my neuropathic pain is caused by Spondylolisthesis. I may end up on a surgeon's table, but in the meantime I want to mitigate the pain as best as possible. This is no way to live, in chronic pain - which most of my friends on this great site also experience.  ANYONE that has even tried Tegretol, anyone with experience with this med would be so very appreciated, IF you want to share your experience with me, and all the folk that read our posts.  Thank you in advance, Lara P.S. I'm leaving for the day (hope my energy doesn't give out today!) and will try to get back online later tonight, if not I'll be on in the morning. Again, I thank you!!

Vomiting,https://www.drugs.com/answers/breast-tenderness-result-taking-morning-after-3327576.html,Is breast tenderness a result from taking morning after pill?,"I took morning after pill 2 weeks ago and I haven’t had any symptoms at all. No bleeding, no nausea, no dizziness, no vomitting, no other symptoms related to being pregnant. But 2 weeks later (which is today) I started to experience in breast tenderness. It was itchy before and erected, then it’s painful when touch. I applied moisturising cream which stopped the itchiness but there’s still the itchiness left, like I can feel it and I want to scratch it but it’s nothing major. I thought that this could be the symptoms for my upcoming period since I experienced some period-like cramps as usual but not as painful.  Correct me if I’m wrong, thank you. "
Muscle Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/muscle-pain-very-large-hematoma-right-thigh-582977.html,Muscle Pain - I had a very large hematoma in my right thigh two months ago. During this episode I?,"... could not move my leg at all. I had emergency surgery to to remove the hematoma, and a 1.5 liter of blood clot was removed from my thigh. However, my leg remained extremely swollen for 3 weeks (normal circumference = 22""; swollen circumference = 36""). The first two weeks of this three week period, I was bedfast, and underwent physical therapy to use a walker. I am currently walking with a cane, but I have an indentation on the quadricep that is 1"" wide and roughly 4"" long and runs perpendicular to my leg. I have a constant burning sensation in this indentation. Palpating the muscle under this indentation causes a very sharp, very intense stabbing pain with severe burning pain for several hours after palpation. The pain associated with this indentation follows the quadricep to the knee, and makes it painful to bend my knee. Finally, my questions: 1.) Is this pain related to permanent damage? 2.) What are my pain management options? "
