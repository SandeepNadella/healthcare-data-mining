Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/upper-back-chest-soreness-taking-deep-breath-2900464.html,Upper back/chest soreness when taking a deep breath?,"I've had this issue since last October and I'm really hoping that someone can help. I've had a pain in my upper back (mostly the left side) that sometimes extends to my chest as well. For a long time, everything felt relatively normal except for when I would sneeze or take a deep breath. When I did either of those things, it would hurt pretty bad. Like a sharp pain. Luckily, now I can sneeze and it generally doesn't hurt, but breathing is an issue and often my back/side/chest feels sore. I initially went to a PCP who sent me to a lung specialist. They did a CT scan and blood work and reported everything normal. For the past 2 months or so, I have been going to a chiropractor hoping that might help things as well. Any relief provided by the beds is short lived and comes back within an hour or two. The only thing that has worked really at all was being prescribed a high dose anti-inflammatory drug. That helped, but the symptoms reappeared within a couple of weeks. Sometimes it helps to rub my back, chest, or side, but again the pain comes back. Any thoughts or clues as to what I might have? I thought I might have a rib out of place, but wouldn't the chiropractor see that on my x-rays or the lung specialist with my CT scan? Thanks for any advice. "

(Had my period around the 16th the next month) Recently in early march we had unprotected sex again 2x a day(he pulled out but we were scared so we took plan b.(had my period around the 24th the next month) Plan b has affected my period, the last time I had my period was from the last days of March to the 1st week of april) I've taken plan b 3x over the past 6 months, I know I made a mistake we are going to get birth control, but now recently around mid April we had unprotected sex about a week before my period. While we had sex, something appeared around his penis. It seemed like vaginal discharge. It looked egg white and was very thick. That normally comes out of me in small amounts during sex. I think it came out a lot this time because we haven't had sex in so long. He pulled out in time, we thought more than likely it came out of me not him, also because nothing was coming out of him so he didn't even cum. I didn't take plan b because I didn't want to damage my body anymore. I also thought the chances were low for me of being pregnant. One week later I would have expected my period which I guess would have been over by the 5th or 6th this month. Is it possible that I'm pregnant? Is it too early to tell? Could if just be because plan b has really messed up my period? Also I have been stressing a lot lately. I think maybe I have been ovulating a little recently the past couple of days but it's very thin and not a lot & kind of sticky. I have also been feeling a little bloaty.

She took a culture and I came back negative for STDs but the culture did not test for herpes. It has been four months since the outbreak and I have not had any outbreaks.

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/oxycontin-side-effects-on-new-op-317976.html,Oxycontin side effects on new OP?,"A good person on here asked me to post a question as I and so many others seem to be having terrible side effects from the new OP formulation that Purdue Pharma put out to make tamper proof so that abusers couldn't cut them open anymore.  I started the new OP on 9/6 feeling as good as I ever can with RSD in chronic pain with this being the only long acting opiate that not only ever helped my pain but also that I wasn't severely allergic to. A few days before Tuesday, 9/14 I felt constipated attributing it to the new OP formula. On 9/14 I began vomiting knowing it was the medication/constipation problem. I stopped vomiting but the next day woke up feeling flu like symptoms with a fever of 100.9 and what is medically called; malaise which means a general feeling of being ill also with my stomach still out of sorts.  It is now day 17 on this new OP formula and I'm not as bad as I was on 9/14 through 9/18 but I'm still daily feeling ill, having a low grade fever, and my stomach just isn't right and I feel it gets worse after the usual time that it always took for the old formulation of OC to kick in; about 1 1/2 hours.  I feel I could have the same pain relief personally if I could take the amount I'm prescribed but my stomach won't allow it along with not being able to take the Percocet for breakthrough pain; usually 3 to 4 a day but with the stomach problems, I've only been able to take one most days; maybe a 2nd. I called my pharmacist who has had other complaints of very similar symptoms that I reported. He didn't say how many but it didn't sound good. I've had the same pharmacist for over 11yrs and he knows me well and does talk to me.  I have thought that maybe we are having withdrawals from the old formulation and it could take time for our bodies to adjust to the new OP formulation as the compounds have changed.  I am trying to not just psych myself out due to these side effects knowing that the compound change could be the problem and give it time to see if my stomach can handle this and start feeling better in general.  My doctor knows that ALL other long acting opiates that I have been prescribed have given me serious allergic reactions so I must have an extremely sensitive system. Last year I was even put on Opana and I couldn't breathe after taking only the 1st pill.  I would have already gone off of this entirely if there were other options for me but feel I have to give it a try.  I would like anyone who is taking this new OP kind and was on the old OC formulation to post here on this question and keep up to date with any side effects or symptoms they may be having as we just need to try to help each other here. Maybe we can figure this out together. I was only able to take the dose I'm supposed to for the 1st 8 days so I also don't know if this is going to relieve my own chronic pain the way the OC did along with my breakthrough meds. I see my doctor soon and will have to tell her what is going on after I figured out this was not a flu bug or virus but this new OP itself. I was extremely upset as I tried to do an online search today only to find the drug abusers trying to figure out how to cut it open to abuse it more. The people I've met here are usually genuine and together we can help each other.  I also promise to keep you up to date on my own issues and hopefully we can start feeling better soon. "

Long story short I have been on vicodin for about a year and a half(prescribed I have lots of problems and lots of pain) Well they put me on ultram 3 weeks ago. Found out I was pregnant (almost 5 weeks). So my OBGYN said to stop ultram which I did(had serious withdraws) he told me to have them put me back on the vicodin and if I want to taper. Which I do I am about to have my fourth kid and I want off this CRAP!!! So called my pain clinic and they don't want to help said I can't withdraw from ultrum(YES U CAN). So I guess what happened was the ultram stopped the withdraw from the vicodin the past 3 weeks. I was wondering iff anyone had any advice on how to taper by myself. I have already started I took one this morning and a half one around noon. I am in a lot of pain but I DON'T want a baby addicted. i want to be able to handle my pain somehow without medicine. Any advice or suggestions would be great. What really sucks is docs always say to tell them and they will help well apparently the only one that care is my obgyn, my Oncologist said he can't help and so did others!!! "

The doctor told me it was a more invasive procedure because they were checking the pressure. Within 15 minutes after putting my head up after lying down for hours, I had the worst pain EVER. It was worse than my severe migraines which send me to the hospital vomiting on the way. It was worse than my first week after having a major stroke. The severe pain kept me lying down on the bed 24/7 except for going to pee in a bucket in the bedroom. As long I was laid out flat, I only suffered from my usual severe migraines. But to raise up--the pain was intolerable.  Finally towards the end of the 5th day since the spinal tap, my head pain got better or I was going to the ER to get the blood patch put on. But I really didn't want to spend the 6 hours or more in the ER which is way too cold for me since my stroke.  Does anyone think that the doctor doing the procedure may have screwed up?

I saw my ob/gyn who did a pelvic exam and an ultrasound and gave me pain meds because he thought it was a pinched nerve. Then I saw a GP who refilled my anti-depressants and xanax and referred me to a pain specialist. I then when to the pain specialist and got cortisone shots in my lower back which only worked for a few weeks but then I started my period after each set of shots in my pelvis and would bleed for over 30 days. I had more check ups and got referred to a doctor who specializes in women's hormonal issues and I have had her do blood and saliva test and thyroid tests on me. Now I am in physical therapy and it is helping but I am still in alot of pain. I take hydrocodone 5/500 a couple a day but I have gotten a tolerance to them. I finally went to a psychiatrist to get all of my meds synchronized and checked to make sure none of them were interacting with each other and found that my anti depressants weren't working and he prescribed me different ones. When I got the scripts I needed to get groceries so I used a different pharmacy. Now my doctor told me that all of my medical providers are receiving letters with all of my doctors and prescriptions and calling them into question. I have GAD, depression, and Organic Pain Syndrome which are all valid medical explanations for my meds, along with my bulging disc. I wonder if it is legal for the health insurance company to send all of this information to all of my doctors. Also the letter insinuates that I am doctor shopping and drug seeking. I am afraid of going back to the doctor when I need help, and afraid my insuance company is going to drop me.

I have often recommended here that you be completely honest with your PM doctor because they are in partnership with you and deserves your honesty so that they can help you. My friend. who posted here about what to do about the fentanyl patch falling off and not working the full three days causing her to both chew her patches and also to get opioids from off the track sources and take drugs not prescribed . I tried to help, and with our advice here she asked to have her patches change every 48 hours and did receive more patches. Unfortunately she was drug tested that day and subsequently received a letter discharging her from his care. I helped write a letter to him admitting what she had done and asking him to reconsider but he did not budge and now she is facing withdrawal from the patch and no pain medication for her physical problems. Does she have any options? Is she never going to be able to get pain medication again? Out of fear of not being believed by her doctor she made a mistake and withheld the truth. I know she would never make the mistake again - and the sad thing is the two day patch was giving her the pain relief she had sought all along. Is there any recourse for her? Would another PM doctor take her on? I feel so sad for her, as she approaches the withdrawal from the patch. Her doctor gave her five days of valium and cut her loose. From what I have read here fentanyl withdrawal is extremely tough- and I find it unconscionable for a physician to have put her on the drug and then abandon her to detox on her own. Sorry to write so much but I am hurting for her and wanting to help her find help, I know she has learned her lesson. Any advice would be welcome. I swear I want to kiss my own doctor next time I see him! I almost feel guilty that I have the pain meds I need. "

I suffer with severe lower back pain and I have arthritis in both hips and my right knee cap. I know this is horrible and it is so depressing that I am facing all of this at my age. The horrible thing is that I am so terribly addicted to these pain pills that I don't know what to do. I have 8 kids and 1 of them is an 11 month old who I can't even pick up half the time do to the chronic pain I am in and I am absolutely useless to him first thing in the morning until I have had my meds and am able to move. I am taking way above the dose I am supposed to be taking and if I don't take more then the doctor is giving me I cannot function because the pain is so bad. I have asked the doctors to please get me into see pain management or ortho or something because I am obviously not on the correct medication since it is not even helping my pain when I stay at the correct dose. Since I do not take the doses prescribed I am always running out of my medicine early and I either borrow medication from a friend of mine who is on the same medicine for a different disorder, or I have to buy them off the street. I am a complete mess and I am my wits end. I cannot continue on this road and I need help and advice really bad. I certainly cannot afford to buy medication off the street with 8 kids and If I don't have the medicine I get very ill as well as suffer in pain. I just don't know what to do. I don't have any medication at all today and no prescription to refill or even due if I did have one and I don't have any money to even buy any. My last dose was last night before I went to bed at about 11:30 and I am starting to get really ill already. Does anyone know if it is safe for me to just stop Cold Turkey? And if I do that does anyone have any ideas on how I can do it? I don't want to get terribly ill and I tried it once before and ended up in the e.r. 2 days later with my blood pressure sky high and my heart rate through the roof. I am already on Xanax and have been for 19 years because I suffer from severe Anxiety disorder and the Xanax does nothing for me to help keep my withdrawal symptoms down at all.

I have never done any drugs without a prescription, nor have I ever done any illegal drugs. My only exposure to pain killers has been Percocet after surgeries. I am a lightweight and it made me very loopy. I have never taken any drugs for my back pain since I have two kids and I have to drive them around. Also, I am a computer programmer and I have to be 100% with it to get work done. This week my PM doctor talked me into trying some pain medication, as I am not (yet) a surgery candidate, and the only alternative is drugs while waiting to see if my latest round of physical therapy will work. My diagnosis is bilateral L5-S1 Spondylolysis with a grade 1 Spondylolisthesis resulting in lumbar macroinstability. He prescribed me Suboxone 2mg/0.5mg films. He said he has had great success with people with my condition using Suboxone who do not wish to take the heavy more addictive drugs. He stated he was starting me out with the weakest does since I claimed to be a light weight. In case it matters, I am 6'4"" 200lbs, so I certainly don't look like a light weight, and I am also on Paxil 10mg 2x/day for anxiety. On Wednesday at 4pm I took my first dose which was one film. Within a couple of hours I felt pretty wasted. More or less I felt like a drank a six pack of beer in short order. I was slurring my words just a bit, and a little tipsy on my feet. I woke up the next morning with the worst headache of my life. I thought my head was going to split in half. After 30 seconds on my feet I became nauseus and vomited. The headache and nausea continued for several hours. I forced down some toast and half a banana and promptly vomited that up. By late afternoon my wife was getting worried. She called the doc's office and the nurse practitioner said it sounded like a mild overdose, and prescribed me Zofran 4mg for nausea, and Naprocet 500mg for headaches. The Zofran works well and I am able to keep food down, and the Naprocet works for about two hours, then the headaches come back. I am only supposed to take the Naprocet 2x per day unfortunately. The nurse said she wants me to continue the Suboxone, except to cut the films into four or even eight pieces and take two of the tiny doses per day and see how it goes. I have still NOT taken and more doses since the very first one, since I don't ever want to feel this bad again in my life. So I am struggling with the decision to give the medication another try since despite all of the horrible side effects, it did knock out my pain more or less completely. I have a follow up with the nurse in a week. Any advice for someone like me would be greatly appreciated! "

Methadone 25 mg a day controlled the pain. However there is such a negative stigma when it comes to Methadone. Whenever I have to go to any type of specialist, I feel like they see me as some type heroin addict. I have never taken any recreational drugs. I was never exposed to any type of illegal substances. It could be that my husband & I married while I was a senior in high school. lol :) I even report to my doctor if I have to take only 1 extra 5 mg in a month of whatever I am using to control my pain.

That would not be so bad if that was the only medicine I had to take. However, when you take 2 different medicines for your severe chronic gastritis, 2 different allergy drugs, high blood pressure drug & cholesterol drug. Then there are the as needed drugs such as meclizine for vertigo, promethazine for nausea, & 2 anti- depressants.

My Dr had asked for me to keep a log for two weeks and then schedule another appt w/ him to go over everything I've done to keep this from happening. My appt is this Fri April 8th and the past two weeks i've written down everything i've already tried in the past 2 months and about to go crazy, cause they have never heard of anything like this or seen anyone have this problem. But since December of 2010 I had noticed on my take home dosages that the next day when taken out of my lock box that my methadone (165mg) had turn a very light pink shade. When I looked at the bottle closer it had appeared that the bottle when turned slightly sideways that the bottle had pink stuck to the bottle. I opened the cap and looked closely and it looked like the methadone had a crystalized appearance floating, as if the methadone had broken down into a sugary substance just floating. I put the cap on and shook it to get the substance attached to the bottle off, but it would not come off unless i held it under hot water on the bottle(still with cap on) but would still be a very light pink shade. I've even gone to open the bottle the next time to dose and put warm water on inside and shake it to get it off from inside the bottle and drink it, but for some reason every steps i take to get the stuff off the bottle and the sugary/crystalized substance to break up, does not feel like i'm taking my full 165 mg dose. It feels like i've just taken an 80 mg dose. I've put my dosages in my lock box everywhere in my house to the fridge to place it to where I thought would be the right temperature and it still looks like it stuck ON inside the bottle and also looks like the sugary substance floating inside the bottom. I don't know if the methadone breaks down to the substance or what... but my DR at the clinic is very puzzled to why this is doing this to me. No one has access to my lock box or a key. So i've actually had to go from going to the clinic just on Mondays & Thursdays to going back every day now because of the way i feel when i have to take my dosages at home. I'm very frustrated with this and don't know what else to do. I don't know what else to do and hopefully you guys can point me in the right direction on what more i can do?! =( Cause i just know that at my next Drs appt this Friday, that if he didn't know what it could be and never hearing of this, that he's still not gonna know what to do and hopefully someone can give me some sort of advice? Please & thank you so much... hopefully this makes sense & can understand what I'm saying...  Frustrated in Phoenix "

I... started on 25 for a week then went up to 50. On 50 I started having random sharp pains on my scalp. Like a drill bit. I thought it was anxiety so I went up to 100 and two weeks later 150. I was on 150mg by the end of July. That’s when my face around my eyes started burning and tingling in my scalp. Mentally I felt fine but lots of symptoms in face and head. I would get random sharp head aches and pin behind the eyes. I just though it was anxiety symptoms but my sister said it could be meds. I went to my Pschy doc and he said he never had heard of the symptoms before. That did not help my hope that It was the meds. So on Aug 31 we decided to taper down. I went on 125mg for 7 days then down to 100mg for 15 days and am now on day 4 of 75mg.  It seems first week on 100mg was rough symptom wise but last week the burning in my face did not seem as intense. Yesterday and today a little more symptoms with pin and needles in my arms. (Which has happened before). Anyway I just discovered your sight while in the taper down and have started reading the book. My questions are as follows if you have time.

Life changes required I go back on something. My questions are as follows if you have time. 1. Could it be the brand of generic my body cannot adjust to causing the nerve pain burning and tingling ? 2. Is these uncommon symptoms for zoloft? 3. Will there be days when symptoms come and go as I taper off ? My doc said that is impossible. That the symptoms will fade on a steady decline with no ups or downs "

I know that my sleep disorder is caused by several mitigating factors that come together. 1) I suffer from shift related sleep disorder, in that i work 12 hr Nightshifts (7p-7a) 3-4 nights/week. 2) I have severe Tinnitus, so when it becomes quiet and time for sleep, I am left with screaming high pitched sound bilaterally. 3) I suffer from severe sensorineural hearing loss. When i take my Hearing Aids off at bedtime, I am functionally Deaf. Not being able to hear anything (my hearing loss is fairly recent, like only 2 yrs) causes some anxiety since i know i will not hear anything like a storm, someone banging on my door, tornado sirens, or someone breaking into my home. I have a wonderful Primary Care Doc... only see him every 6 mos or if I need anything in between. I used to take 50mg Trazadone, along with 3mg Lunesta for sleep. Then I needed to upgrade to 100mg Trazadone after about 8 mos of use, since the body gets used to things and doses. About 8 months ago, we d/c'd the Trazadone, and started 0.5mg Xanax. It was not quite enough, so now I take 1mg Xanax along with my 3mg Lunesta to go to sleep and it works fairly well. I dont seem to manage more than 6 hrs sleep though.

My theory is if you take the lowest dose which for me would be 45MG or 60MG in which I do not get 100% relief until I get to the 90MG .I get 92% relief from my pain. I'm proud to say that I have never gone beyond that dosage after 14 years and after much research found a dosage that works for me. I have been off the pain meds twice when I had my two surgeries by weaning off them and did not miss them  Here is the problem, I have been going to pain center for the last 5 years as my Dr. got scared giving me high amounts of oxycodone. At first the pain center was not happy with the amounts and try to cut me down only to see it was not helping my pain levels so they back off.. The pain center is now getting political pressure from all sides. The FDA, Whitehouse, and the group ""PROP"" which is trying to hurt chronic pain patients. I would assume these groups have an influence as they are coming down hard on us chronic pain patients from all avenues.  The pain center I go to and they are hard to find, out of the clear blue sky told me last month I must cut down to the equivalent of 200MG to 250MG of morphine which would be that I would need to cut myself to 11 pills or less which is roughly 166.67MG or less compared to 300MG a day. No other meds thrown in just do it. I was waiting for marijuana to get settle in Boston Mass, to give that a try and hopefully cut some of the narcotics but they will not let me do that as they would kick me out if I even try it. I said it may help me get to their goal if it would work and I still got no for an answer.  They have already cut me 30MG of meds per day. I already feel the effect which is putting pain into my work, exercise, gardening, and walking. My quality of life is starting to be effected and I'm trying to work with them but I'm afraid they will go all the way to 10 or 11 which would really make life a sucky place to be. I will be able to do it but I will get the things I love in life out. It's not right I should have to pay the price because someone OD on 3 or four prescription drugs. The news does not tell you that but when they OD there are more than one drug in them.  I hope to work with the pain center to cut some out but I should not have to, as I do not abuse the meds and get urine test every month and follow all their strict rules and rightly so. I also lock up my meds and go to one pharmacy as they demand. I can go 18 hours with not meds and not miss the oxycodone but the pain by then is so bad. The point is I do not miss it at all but I need it for pain relief.  Any ideas on how I can get them to feel compassion and work with me not to go that low. I really should not have to cut down at all but in order not to seem like a drug person seeking to hold on to those high amounts, I need to work with them, but I'm afraid they will go to low. Help please if you had any experience in this and what was your outcome?  Anybody with success with high amounts of oxycodone out there that helps you function in every day duties? I would like to hear from you. We are not drug seekers but unfortunate souls with dreadful diseases trying to get by in life but when we go to hospitals, doctors etc.. and we know all about the pain meds to help with our disease we are nothing but drug seekers.  I have no side effects, plus with Crohns the oxycodone works in my favor with bowel movements as the meds slow me down so I'm not in the bathroom all the time. I also feel the oxycodone helps slow the disease down I really do.  In ending, I will keep fighting for my right and all of our rights as chronic pain patients to have the freedom to have pain meds and to have the dosage we need no matter how high it may seem if it helps as live a long and productive life. Let’s stay together and fight these groups who mean to do the right thing but are going about it in the wrong way by hurting us by putting dosage limits on our quest to get pain relief "

I'm freaking out because I can't get any?,"I should be here in paradise having a great time as I waited through six months of a crappy winter/spring, I was so excited to get out that I didn't really look at my prescription bottles until Wednesday when I thought to myself 'that's AWFULLY low... you're not going to make it through the weekend on that'.  So I phoned my doctor back in Toronto who listened and understood & said they'd FedEx my refills here to Phoenix. Thank GOD. However, I didn't get a confirmation that they'd been sent, I have no idea how long that's going to take, and don't really know what to do in the meantime. It's more the thought that I can't, like at home, just walk over to the clinic pharmacy and get my prescriptions refilled. I have to wait, not knowing if they've even been sent, and then what happens next.  This just sucks. I have all this warmth and walks and fun waiting and all I feel like doing is pulling the blinds and going to bed. I'd even just pack up and go home but now I don't know if my meds are en route, so now I have to stay here!  I should've banked my pills like I did my money before coming out here. I just didn't think, and when I was offered two extra weeks stay, of course I said a million times yes. Since Wednesday I've tapered my pain pills and anti-anxiety (because I have to) and so running out won't be a total shock. If I only take one pill per day I will officially be out of everything by Tuesday, and while I don't like that thought, I'm kind of trying to deal with it. All I can do until then is wait, I'm in the US, I'm visiting, I have no insurance here and what else can I do? I take hydrocodone for a very nasty and painful Achilles' tendon tear, I was a marathon runner; I also take clonazepam for anxiety. I always follow the recommend dose, I've never gone over, it's just that I've always been so careful with my medications. I can already feel my Achilles' tendon pain flaring up. "

I started taking Nucynta on Friday 11/13/15 and it seemed to help for the first couple of hours and then it seemed to wear off. After my 2nd pill, the same thing happened. My husband said that maybe since this is a synthetic narcotic that it may take some time to build up in my system. I tried to research that online, but haven't come up with much. I figure that it wouldn't hurt to ask around and see if my husband's theory is correct or not. This pain has been making my life miserable and I don't know how much more I can take. If anyone could answer my question and maybe offer some advice, I would truly appreciate it! "

I currently live in Santa Cruz, CA, where the weather fluctuates a lot, both throughout the year and during the day (everyone wears layers; it can go hot to cold, sunny to cloudy and windy, in the same day). I've had symptoms of PsA for ~6yrs, but only was diagnosed a little over a year ago. I'm currently on Methotrexate and Enbrel, with little results. My condition has deteriorated quite rapidly over the past year. I hurt in just about every joint, as well as the tendons and ligaments in my hands and arms. I'm no longer able to work; it's hard to find a comfortable position for more than a few minutes, and it's hard to do basic functions (like writing, using utensils, getting dressed, brushing teeth, etc.). My husband and I went to Fiji last October for our honeymoon, and the heat made it possible for me to actually go for walks (I was on Sulfasalazine and Methotrexate at that point), but it was so humid I didn't really want to leave the air conditioning. My doctor thought that the humidity probably helped more than just the heat, but my husband and I recently went to Death Valley, and I felt great! I was able to wander around the desert, taking pictures, even hiked a little, so dry heat helps, too (thank goodness, because humidity sucks). So now we're thinking that we should move to a hotter climate. Since we haven't stayed somewhere hot for more than a few days at a time, I thought I'd check if other people have found that a hotter climate helps, or if my experiences were just coincidence. Also, does the the humidity help more? I don't really want to live in a humid area, but if it helps, I'd do it. Thanks! "

Then They’ve done more X-rays, a numerous amount of different blood work and other lab tests, then they finally did a cat scan; and was able to determine that it’s been from constipation. So now my doctor has me taking everyday before bed (1) Prilosec pill for heart burns, then (1) Exlax pill, then she told me to drink all 10 capfuls of Miralax mixed into a 50 ounce bottle of Gatorade everyday with in a 2-4 hours time frame (which has me worried because that’s a lot of Miralax in one day!!) but this is my 4th day on all of this and nothing has happened yet!

Cymbalta was to also be used as a top up to help with my chronic back pain due to degenerative disc disease, fibromyalgia and depression. I have been on Targin and Oxynorm for the past 18 years. Two titanium disc replacement in 1999. I have been on many different drugs to help with my nerve pain, restless legs etc. have gone on and come off the drugs without too many hassles BUT Cymbalta is one 'bitch' of a drug!!! to get off. I have read other people's descriptions of their 'brain zaps'. Yes I have had the same electrical party in my head along with the headaches, nausea,mood swings etc.  why did I come off Cymbalta?? Well it had been difficult to get 60 mg tablet. It seemed like every pharmacy in Melbourne had run out or they couldn't get it in. So I bought the 30mg and took two tablets a day. As I take too many tablets I decided to cut down on some of my drugs. I cut down from two Cymbalta daily to one daily for three weeks then one every second day then one every third day. I ran out of tablets and decided to stop altogether as I was feeling OK and thought I had come to a point of no return. All good? NOT!! How stupid of me!!! Electrical parties and nausea was horrible. I really thought I was going nuts!!! My poor husband wanted to take me to the hospital but I thought I was suffering from sinuses and I got prescribed antibiotics from my GP. I like my GP but he really has no clue about medication. I know that sounds stupid but GP's know how to prescribe medication but knowing the ins and out of medication. Forget about it!! You have to do your research. Then tell them.  But I was determined not to take Cymbalta again. It has been almost 6 weeks since I have come off the tablets. I pray I am over the worse of the withdrawal symptoms. I do have headaches still but my head isn't zapping as much now and my nausea is minimal. I just want to feel 'normal' again. Will I ever?? Who knows?? I have had over 20 operations in my life and I have suffered from many other types of physical problems and I am a positive person and have come out the other end of my surgeries very well. However , withdrawal symptoms of Cymbalta has taken a piece of my soul away!!! It has been the most horrific thing I have had to go through. The last words from me is Don't take Cymbalta. There are other drugs to help. "

It did not calm me at all. If anything it made me either more anxious or just maybe didn't work at all. I have since then gotten my 1mg refilled and it works like it is suppose to. Calms me down within minutes of taking it or it keeps me from getting overly upset about unneccesary issues. The 2mg if it were still good should have out me to sleep compared to how the 1mg does me. I am basically asking how long do they last inside a medicine bottle in a cabinet at room temperture before going completely null and void of working to calm me down? I guess I'm just trying to figure out how long I've had them in the cabinet. I realize I will destroy them and get rid of them because they did not work at all. If anything they might have made me even more upset because I had no control of my emotions when I took it. To the point of having a panic attack which I have not had one in over two years. There's the reason my dr dropped my dosage back to 1mg. Is that even posssible or is it just in my head? I didn't take anything else with it either, before you ask? And I will not be taking anymore of them I just really need to know if I'm right or wrong about this for my own sake, I hate to know that the issue I had to face was just so bad nothing was going to keep me from havig a panic attack. My biggest fear is them and the night terrors starting again. Thank you for your time and sorry I put so much detail into what I'm sure you'll find as a simple question. But this matters to me. I can't remember when I put them in the cabinet and that seems to be bothering me more than it should. Thank you again for you time and consideration for answering me. I will greatly appreiciate it.

Basically I have been suffering from anxiety for about six weeks now, I only got diagnosed yesterday. The reason why I left it so long was because I wanted to see if this horrible feeling would go on it's own, this was before I knew it was anxiety. I have been having panic attacks a lot recently. I would be sitting there or doing something completely fine and then out of nowhere my head feels dizzy like I'm going to faint, I feel light headed, my vision goes funny, my breath shortens, my mind loses all focus and I am panicking. This will go on for about 5-10min and then slowly fades away leaving me nothing but exhausted and low. I continuously have this numbing pressure at the front of my head and around my eyes and the bridge of my nose. It is continuous. It makes me feel even worse about myself, I feel detached from myself like I'm not even here and it is so scary. Like for example I went to my Boyfriend's family BBQ last week and it felt like I wasn't even there and I Love my Boyfriend so so much. It felt like I was someplace else as well as being familiar with everyone and everything. I could be there eating and it feels like I'm not eating. I could be talking and it feels like I didn't even say a word. Normal stuff like showering, being in my own room doesn't even feel right to me, like I constantly have to remind myself where I am at all times. I was at work speaking, walking and on the computer but it doesn't feel like it's me at all. I was at my Mum's friend's hairdresser today to get my hair done. I spoke to my hairdresser and it didn't even feel like it was me having the conversation as much as I could hear her and myself speak and feel my mouth move. It's like my brain can't make the connection and it breaks my heart. I feel like my memory is on stand by, I am being forgetful of stuff that I am usually on point with, I feel completely confused. When I got diagnosed the doctor gave me some Propanolol to try and I am going into my second day taking it, I researched it before I took it and I heard a lot of positive feedback from it but I am so scared right now and I am praying for guidance. Somebody please help me, please. "

Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/does-abilify-help-with-focus-472857.html,Does abilify help with focus?,"I was prescribed abilify in a very low dose, so my doctor said. I filled the prescription and never took it. I have some memory issues as a result of a mild aneurism. I didn't argue about schizophrenia diagnosis though i don't agree. I have been dealing with depression almost my entire life. My previous doctor actually took me off of medications altogether as she was afraid they might trigger another aneurism. Other doctor knows this though it has been 8 years before. Just in February I took a 5 hour energy drink to help me stay awake that nearly killed me. 55 beat per minute heart rate. Was in hospital observation for close to 24 hours. Let me out too early but eventually recovered. My first anti-depresants worked well at low dose (I split the pill down to 1/4) These were seroquel and effexor and that was in early 90's. They helped me get out the house, but i don't recall why my previous doctor took me off the pills prior to trying a series of other medication before she removed me completely due to sensitivity to side effects. The fact that i am vegetarian may cause stronger sensitivity i think. Anyhow, there was an ad on TV by lawyers sueing the seroquel and effexor companies. I didn't qualify. Then i search the internet about abilify and the first thing i see is a YouTube video that says ability kills and i told my recent doctor of this before i actually filled the prescription. He doesn't seem worried nor does his nurse. They are really pressing that they believe it would help me, especially with focus. The doctor tried to assure me that it was the lowest dose and that those results usually happen for someone who takes it long-term. He approved me splitting the pill dosage. On the other hand when discussing with his nurse that i filled the prescription and i decided to take it as needed, she was surprised and said it didn't work that way , that i had to take it everyday for it to work. I expressed my ill desire to be dependent on psychotics and prefer the natural way around. I search side effects and this forum to see if anyone has been helped by the drug and a number of things concerned me. Before i got to this website, I concluded that they should remove abilify off the market. If anyone dies from the medication, they cannot make a comment on this page. It seems these ones who were helped the most took 2.5 kilograms or less and for not more than two weeks. It would be helpful if this site suggests commenters list the dosage and length of time taken. This would make a more accurate measure on how long abilify can be taken before it kills. My medical goal is to go back to work and lead a normal working life. Though even physical factors contributed, I haven't worked a consistent job since early 90's. I am now over 40. Suggestions please. I would also like to hear from a loved one whose loved one actually died taking abilify and what their dosage was and length of time taken. Thank you "

Heeding my first therapists warning that the reason so many people relapse back into bipolar behaviors is because they start to feel better and stop taking their medications. So I determined not to make that mistake. I've live a life as near to normal (that setting on the dishwasher not life) that I thought was possible considering what life off the meds is like for me and worse for others. However I have never been able to achieve what my psychiatrist calls a balanced terrace! So a few months ago he came back from a conference filled with all these new studies and would I take part in a new study on the bipolar condition. Without getting to lengthy here part of the study included hypnosis and regression sessions. Wow talk about rock my world again and again! At the completion of the study I had way more information than I cared to ever recall, I had 4 new disorder diagnosis and a sleep study showed a big fat 0 zero for delta sleep. My meds were changed and believe me that was as bad a jolt as the new information that seems, he said, to have been neatly tucked away in dusty file boxes in my brain. Did my psychiatrist just jump on a new band wagon? Is it possible to have been being treated for a bipolar condition for 12 years and NOT be bipolar? And from the looks of the new Med list I'm beginning to wonder if my body (one kidney only) is going to be able to handle this? Being bipolar didn't scare me, what he is suggesting now terrifies me!

Doc says to wait it out until 8 weeks, then I think there's a plan to bump to 200 mg. I'm taking 1/2 an Ativan a couple times a day and at night to help until the meds kick in, if they do. I have been on 100-125 mg Zoloft for the last 15 years, and have had great results. I'm wondering if 25 mg just isn't enough of an increase, but I'm also concerned about going up to 200. It's so hard, as many of you know, to wake up daily and have the feeling still be there. I've been having some depression because of how frustrated I am not to feel better. I'll have moments of happiness and some days are better than others, but the bad days are so hard. I see a therapist once a week and also use the Calm app (meditation) daily. I drink no caffeine, exercise and eat healthy. I am doing all the right things, and I think I'm just feeling discouraged. Another part of my issue is that in mid-September I had my Mirena IUD taken out and although my gyno says I should feel fine, I have been a hormonal mess. I'm now on a low-dose birth control pill to help even out my moods. I had the Mirena taken out to avoid putting hormones into my body, and here I am back to them... Ugh. So, I guess my question is, if you've gone up on Zoloft, what has been your experience, and am I really going to see a big difference over the next two weeks? Luckily, I have a very supportive family and I'm honest with those I'm close to about how I am feeling, but that doesn't help me not feel like they get a little sick of babying me. I just want to be myself again!!! Any help or positive comments are welcome! Thank you guys! "

Pregnancy,https://www.drugs.com/answers/19-implanon-inserted-16-broke-arm-17-knew-746709.html,Im 19 now but I had the implanon inserted when I was 16. It broke in my arm when I was 17. I knew it,... was broken and went to the doctor who basically accused me of trying to get pregnant and that it couldn't possibly break since she tested out how hard it was to break one. I went to see my family doctor numerous times for being sick and not being able to get out of bed due to pain and cramping and I had my period for six months. Once I moved to Colordo last year I went to see a different doctor who suggested I go see another doctor who did work with implanon and get it removed right away. So I did. Who would've guessed for the past two years I was right and my implanon was broken. So my question now is how will this effect me now and in my future? My periods are finally regular now after removal but will it cause problems for when I'm ready to start a family much later down the road? Or any other problems for that matter

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/people-osteoporosis-forteo-injections-521781.html,For the people with osteoporosis that take Forteo injections like me?,"this is poited in todays newsletter by the FDA; good read & hope for the future... Mary THURSDAY Feb. 16, 2012 -- Remote controls may not be for just appliances anymore. In a new small study, women with severe osteoporosis were implanted with a microchip that releases bone-building drugs at the push of a button, a delivery method that could someday become common for various health conditions.   Roughly 1.5-by-2.5 inches in size, the microchip significantly improved patient compliance with a drug regimen that normally requires painful daily self-injections, study authors said. The clinical trial, conducted on seven osteoporosis patients in Denmark, was the first to test a wirelessly controlled microchip in this capacity.   ""It frees patients from the burden of managing their disease on a daily basis,"" said Robert Farra, co-author of the study and president and chief operating officer of MicroCHIPS Inc., the Waltham, Mass., company that funded and supervised the trial. ""I think there will be a class of drugs [for other conditions] that will be very suitable to use the chip for . . . we were very pleased with the results.""   The study is published Feb. 16 in the journal Science Translational Medicine, coinciding with its presentation at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in Vancouver, Canada.   Along with researchers from MIT, Harvard Medical School and other companies and institutions, Farra implanted the microchip just under the skin near the waistline of the seven women, who ranged from ages 65 to 70 and had been using pre-filled injection pens containing teriparatide (brand name Forteo) for their severe osteoporosis, a bone-thinning disease.   Although a fibrous membrane grew around the device, which was expected, the microchip delivered the drug as effectively as daily injections, the study said. Blood tests done after the 12-month study period indicated rates of bone formation similar to when the women self-injected the drug.   Because daily injections can be psychologically and physically challenging, Farra said, only 25 percent of patients on teriparatide actually finish a typical 24-month regimen. But with the implant -- which delivered 20 timed doses controlled by doctors -- the compliance rate rose to 100 percent.   About 50,000 Americans take the drug each year at a cost of $10,000 to $12,000, which would be comparable to the cost of the microchip and the minor surgery to embed it, he said. The microchip can be implanted under local anesthesia in a doctor's office.   ""It not only should offer a better quality of life, we should see improved outcomes because of the compliance boost,"" Farra said, adding that his company is developing a model that will deliver a year's worth of doses. He said he hopes it is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and on the market within four years.   Dr. Robert Recker, director of the Osteoporosis Research Center at Creighton University in Omaha, Neb., said he was skeptical that the microchip could keep the Forteo stable at body temperature since the drug is normally refrigerated when contained in injection pens.   However, Farra said that researchers had modified the drug to make this possible, an effort made easier because each dose was also sealed in tiny air- and moisture-proof compartments in the microchip.   The reservoirs pop open on a pre-programmed schedule or via a wireless signal, which can be sent from a doctor's computer or smartphone, Farra said.   ""I do not see how this can be done with [a] reservoir, either above or below the skin surface,"" Recker said. ""I think the claim must be corroborated with more studies. They must explain how they preserve the drug at body temperature.""   More information   The University of New Hampshire has more about human microchip implantation Hopefully this will become available not only for osteoporosis, byt pain magement too. Lucky us...

Pregnancy,https://www.drugs.com/answers/pregnant-nexplanon-3204348.html,Can I be pregnant on Nexplanon?,"I originally got on Nexplanon back in July 2014 when I first got the implant I had spotting for maybe a week and it was incredibly light. After that I never had a period for the full three years. It expired in July 2016 and I had some spotting in August 2016 (most likely cause it was expired) even then it was very light for a day or so. I got a new implant late August 2016 and now it is January 2017 a few weeks ago I jumped weight to 108 when I typically way 89-100 max. I was becoming very tired, nauseous and emotional and STARVING I also had tender breast to the point brushing a shirt against them made me tear up. I went to the doctor because I was so tired I couldn't even get myself out of bed and I was throwing up at night. I weight 108 still and my doctor was really concerned I could be pregnant but I assured her I shouldn't be because of the implant. She felt on my stomach and gave me zofran to help the nausea. It is now a few weeks later after my last visit and I still am nauseous, slightly emotional but now I am bleeding very bad. It's more like spotting but it's dark and clotty. (Gross sorry) my breast still hurt very bad and I have lost an appetite. I went back for my follow up today and I weigh 110!!

I find it harder everyday to push and break out of this so I can go back to society. I have many obstacles and one of the biggest one is that noise excessive or minor, triggers my episodes and helps along psychosis. I live above a Musician and can't afford to move out as I have no money after I pay rent with my pension. I can't afford to choose better housing as the rent is too high for me. As it is I receive free food and transportation vouchers.  I am suffering more than I can stand and mental health services and housing have said I'm not desperate enough to assist because I have a roof over my head. I fear for my life because I have experienced homelessness for years and finally move into a place and 3 months into it the musicians moves in under me.   I guess I'm asking for understanding more than a solution as there is no easy one, if there were I never would have been homeless at 16 -or anyone else for that matter. My mother doesn't get it and never has, my brother has good intentions but tells me to suck it up and live in society.  Having agoraphobia has totally ruined the management I had for my bipolar and PTSD. I can't escape or assist myself anymore. It's just me, my friends left a very long time ago and I don't have other family to help out. I've never felt this isolated and alone, and I've got a very long history of abuse, neglect and isolation. I ask anyone who has been stuck like me to offer some insight, I have run out of perspectives.  Please, If anyone has anything to help with I'd be eternally greatful, I'll take it on board as long it keeps me from giving up. I want a better life for myself and for everyone with problems. We deserve to be happy too.

After the psych Dr. evaluates her they give her 5 to 10 mg of Haldol and with in 25 to 30 mins she starts to open her eyes and is very calm and cooperative but remembers nothing, could that be from too many times being put under and an allergic reaction developed? they professionals say they really have never seen anything like this I have asked the anesthegologist, the surgeon and the PCP and her Psych Dr. about this and no one seems to know.

Will the results come up as?,"I am under a physicians (neurologist ) care , and am being prescribed 30mg. oxycodone 4x daily . On many occasions , I will need an extra dose or two for the day , and then I run out of my medicine before I'm supposed to . My Dr. tells me that my ins. will not cover a longer lasting version of this med , or time released maybe , but that I need to take my medication as prescribed . I do agree , and this med does scare me , but I need it for the pain that I suffer . My question is : Some times I run out because , I need to take it more often , and I have a relative that is on morphine sulphate , and he will sometimes allow me some of his med. when I run out and I re-pay him when I get mine . Well recently my Dr. has begun random urine testing his patients (before,he would occasionally send me for blood work ) , I wanted to know if I have taken the morphine instead of my regular med. how will it show up in my test ? Does it just come up as ""opiares"" or are they each identified separately ? I have told him in the past that I have done this once or twice and of course he yelled at me , but I was in pain and needed help . I also have had chronic hives for many years (much longer than the chronic pain) , the cause has never been determined as I always have the hives , so testing is near impossible . Any way , over the years , nothing has ever worked for the hives that we have tried , so I pretty much rely on OC products when it gets bad . Well my same relative is on 10mg. valium , and every once in a while when my hives are very bad , I will take a half of one at bed time and it helps me and there is no ""hung-over feeling in the morning or anything . I'm telling you this because I am also on muscle relaxers (for my neck & head pain ) , but I don't take them all of the time like prescribed because I don't like the way they make me feel . And when I occasionally take the valium , it really helps the neck as well . How will this show in my urine test as well as the other . I am really not trying to disobey my Dr.'s orders , but sometimes this helps me . I smoke cigarettes , but I definately DO NOT drink alcohol or take any street drugs of any kind . I have thought of trying marijuana to help with the head & neck , but it scares me . So I have never tried to do this . I did smoke it when I was young (I am a 52 year old woman ) , I think that most of us did back in the day , and I remember sometimes it would give me a headache , the very last thing I want is to make my headaches worse .  I just thought that maybe you could give me some advice here and let me know about how the urine tests actually work . Thank-you very much for your time . "

Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/anyone-very-chatty-zoloft-3356509.html,Is anyone very chatty on Zoloft?,"Im at a time in my life where I have needed to bite the bullet and take anti-depressants due to a series of unfortunate events. I believe I have had mild anxiety for, well, probably 25 odd years (I am 48 female). A year ago I bit the bullet to give myself ""a break"". I take very low doses as I am very sensitive to these medications. First lexapro. After 4 months, I realised they were just causing me to be very angry (about a difficult situation albeit) and weight gain. Then I tried pristiq. 50mg every other day. no issues going on or off, but just vague and still stressed (life was very stressful in any case). I went off them and (only after this) did I end up with debilitating anxiety and depression (leaving me unable to work for nearly 6 months, until the stress finally overtook me. Yep. Kept fighting through, but finally trying to fight too hard to get better and push through, my body and mind pushed back. Probably the best thing that happened. It forced me to stop!). During this time, I was still in a rather challenging personal situation. I relented and went back on Pristiq - only 1/2 a tablet a day. Complicated to chop in half. I put on weight and was ok, but kind of melancholy and tears would still come. Then, after much resistance, I talked to a friend who said she had been on Zoloft for years. After research (and wanting to fit into my clothes again) I got off Pristiq (thank goodness) and had a hell 5 days. Side effects straight away, however I knew they were side effects and went with them.. I started taking ZOLOFT 10 days ago. INSTANT RESULTS!! I MEAN INSTANT!! I have been happy, laughing, energy ok, eating ok, handling VERY stressful situations well. HOWEVER! I cant shut up!! I am a chatty person in any case, however, I do feel that I am WAY too chatty (I am only taking 25mg, which is fine). I wonder if I appear to be manic (its probably just me thinking that), however, positive and happy it is, I would be happy to be a bit more calm (although I dont really feel anxious at all - maybe 1 or 2 hours where the drugs may be in full swing I am a little more sensitive)... Does anyone else find this? I am shocked how well they work and I would say my experience is 75% positive. But am wondering if this is a side effect that will wear off. I would (for the first time be willing to) increase to 50mg but would not like to get even more chatty or agitated. I know we are all different, but if anyone has had similar experiences, I would love some feedback. Thanks for your input!! First time on forum. I have a healthy diet, exercise, am fairly active (not sedentary at all), enjoy a drink but not many and not every every day, practice meditation and a lot of self love and care on this journey. These experiences give you the opportunity to face yourself (and heal yourself - it takes a lot of effort to be kind to yourself, I have learnt!!) I am still not working, which is necessary to ""heal"" but comes with its own challenges. I believe I will be back to it soon enough!  This year, I have been ""diagnosed"" with everything from depression, to anxiety disorder to border personality disorder, to PTSD, to (the latest) bipolar... hmmm.. I do not think its humanly possible to have all of that? I and I KNOW that stress and fear and situational experiences have played a major part in all of this... however, I do sometimes wonder, after my first year and a half on anti-depressants, what role they play in creating just a little bit of havoc as well Anyway, Zoloft has been good and if you think I can iron out the kinks I would love your feedback.

After two to three weeks of the medication, my anxiety has gone away for the most part, with the occasional anxious break through, but now I've been dealing with moderate depression, sleep issues, feeling tired all the time (which is probably a side effect of Paxil), feeling like I'm going crazy, weird dreams (more than usual haha) and mood swings. I know 10mg is a low dose and and that it can take two months to work fully. I'll probably be going up to 20mg two weeks from now. But what I want to know is does Paxil gradually take time to work fully or does it just one day works fully? "

She is mentally handicapped (functions about six years old) and she was originally diagnosed as PTSD psychosis, but I don't think it is correct. She started delusions a couple years after being the victim of a violent crime, but from what I have been reading she seems to fit more into paranoid schizophrenia. We tried ALL kinds of meds and they caused her to start shop lifting and would make her go right into horribly violent delusions every time she was upset. I got her off everything but prazosin (for night terrors) and paxil by putting her on niacin therapy. It was working great, but we reduced the amount when she had a lot of fatigue (turned out to be an abscessed tooth) and even though we are back to her original level of niacin it has been a nightmare!!!  She became manic six days ago and after a couple days I simply was unsure what to do so I gave in and accepted a prescription for a psych med. She was given Saphris because it was fast acting and she was in a mania. I can honestly say with all the things we have tried it seems to be working better, but it has only been 3 doses at 10mg. She was manic yesterday and I had to give it to her before bed time, so she ended up not sleeping most of the night after napping in the afternoon. She is still delusional and I was wondering what others experiences where as to when the delusions will end? Her appetite seems to be up and down, is this normal? She is sleepy and then super alert even many hours after taking the med, and I was wondering if that evens out? Also her med manager said with extended use it is highly likely she will have to have her thyroid removed??? Really? "

I went into the ER for pressure in my head due to me hitting my head several weeks prior... Kept getting bad sharp shooting pain in my head as well as headaches & really bad pressure in the back of my head.. Needless to say if been suffering from headaches possible migraines for years now from a car accident several years back.. But since hitting my head the pain went from bad to worse.. Lots of pressure, light, loud sounds, ect effected it more, but the pressure & sharp knife stabbing like pains come & go in certain parts in my head, I woke up one morning with bad pressure, headache, vomiting, dizziness, all 10 finger tips went knumb for an hour or do, fever, I knew it had to be something so I finally went to the Medical aid unit in my city.. The doc there thought when I hit my head it triggered migraines, but I advices him I suffered from headaches for years.. He referred me to a local hospital to the ER to get. Cat- scan just incase there could be any internal bleeding in the brain, so I went.. The cat scan showed that the back of my brain was enlarged, & the resident ER doc wanted to get a sexing option and possibly do a spinal tab.. They ended up discharging me & referring me to follow up with a PCP ASAP.. I returned home, still having the pain, fever, ect.. Ended up goin to another local hospital because the pressure, pain ect got worst & I started having hot flashes, sweats, & then cold chills... Even had those symptoms the night prior to going to the medical aid unit.. When I returned back to another ER, they read the previous CT- scan & wanted to do the spinal tab, which they did, ran blood work & both came back ok... But they wanted to look further so they ended up admitting me & i started having pain in my left knee/leg, as soon as i stood up with having to be assistant to the restroom, my left leg gave out on me, started having these unfamiliar twitches in my knee, & pain down my leg, so with that said theynoted it and did a MRI the next day, which showed several white spots in the back of my brain that was unknown... I spent 5 days in the hospital 7 different medicines, & since being discharged since June 21 I still have the sharp pains in my head that come and go, sensitivity to loud piercing noices, lights, ect... June 26 when I followed up wit a PCP, both legs from my knees down, including my ankles and feet were swallon, the doc said looked like I was retaining water, said to stay off my feet & rest... I find myself sleepy alot, not myself lately, just in a down, upsetting, depressive mood, and very irritated and aggrivated easily... No longer active, and this is one of the meds I'm taking since being in the ER Amitriptyline HCL 25 mg tablets... After reading all these reviews I'm concerned whether or not I should be taking this, because I don't suffer from anxiety or depression... But I hear its for the brain as well.. Still the spots are unknown, I go for a follow up MRI to see if the spots are still there & they said if they are they want to do another spinal tab, the doc PCP thinks the pain in the leg & knee could possibly be a blood clot so I'm getting the MRI this mon & a X-ray & ultrasound of the knee & leg tues... This all has me worried.. Even tho I'm a Christian women, & I have faith & trust in God I'm still worried... Could someone please let me know what they think... When my husband and I looked up what does white spots in the back of the brain indicate in an MRI it's 1st stated MS, then cancer & a few others...

I am RX'ed 'Sandoz brand only' as they stick and work best for me and my local pharmacy orders them for me each month on top of things as it is harder to find brand consistency wearing 2 diff. mcg patches.

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/happen-you-butrans-patch-1636687.html,Did this happen when you were on the Butrans Patch?,"I am wondering if anyone can share their opinion with me if you have been on a pain patch. Originally I had no issues with the patch. I was using a clear waterproof cover to protect it to make sure it lasted the full 7 days but now I can barely keep the patch on for 4 days. I started noticing I was developing little liquid bubbles between the pain patch and the clear cover. I figured it was because my body temperature had increased but because of the liquid under the patch my skin was really getting irritated and I was starting to get blisters. I took the patch off and did not put a new one on for a couple of weeks. On Friday I put the patch on but did not cover it this time. This seemed to be working great until I noticed that I was getting a little fluid built up in the patch again. The corners started turning up and the patch was actually slipping, so I decided to cover a portion of the patch and leave enough uncovered area so the patch and my skin could breath... Now the area that I have covered looks like it has been drenched in a liquid. Does anyone know if the patch is still working? I am so afraid that it might not be effective now. Today, day four is the first day that I feel like my old self so I hate to take off the patch and start this whole process over again... Any opinions are welcomed.

Cause for concern?","I am at the one month mark to the day on Bupropion 300 xl (started much smaller of course) and though most of the side effects have gone away- one has become more prominent- body tremors and a hard (but not rapid) heart beat! My GP simply says ""this stuff has side effects for a while, it may take 2 months to feel the benefits without the side effects"". Though I know the obvious thing would be to tell me to see a psychiatrist, I am not covered by insurance to see a psych and it would be out of pocket and extremely expensive. I'd really like feedback so I don't panic! Typically, later in the day I feel a bit of a ""tremble"" (tremor) in my upper body and head, and my heart beat seems to be a bit more pronounced to the extend that I feel like my head is bobbing a bit. This used to happen as a result of anxiety to me, but now it's present without anxiety. It's not horrific, but I'd like to know if perhaps this is an indicator or too high or a dose or something truly alarming.

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/finding-a-pain-management-doctor-who-isnt-scared-401567.html,Finding a pain management doctor who isn't scared to write prescriptions?,"I am in MI, and been treated for pain with narcotic's after running the entire gamit of procedures, bio-feedback, injections, accupuncture, PT, etc, etc. I was on an acceptable regimen, and was able to function. Last year my brother was diagnosed with Reticular Sarcoma, very aggresive. I had also been diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time while this was going on. I was taking my turn in caring for my brother, the day shift, my husband taking the night shift. And this was while I was recovering from a mastectomy. I was basically living between my home and my brothers. In the confusion, I thought I had misplaced my pain meds, I contacted my pain doc and asked what should I do if I couldn't find them? I was told they would get back to me. If they called me to tell me what to do, I don't know if I missed the call, or they just never called me back, things were so hectic and I was in recovery from surgery.  Fortunately I found I had left them at my brothers home, so in my mind the problem was solved. On my scheduled montly appt for a refill, I show up, but was then taken into a a room where the office manager informs me that the doctor wll no longer give me my meds, the reason being was I did not call back and tell them I had found them. They said I had violated my pain contract by calling in early for pain medication. I was told had I called them back and told them I had found my meds, none of this would be happening. I was shocked! In my mind, I had found them, so the problem was solved. I was crying and upset,and asked to talk to the doctor please (up to that point I thought we had a great doctor-patient relationship) and the office manager said he refused to see me. All she said I could do was to go to another doctor for evaluation the following morning, show up at 7:00 am and see what could be done. Well, I showed up, but was told the doctor would be out of the office until the following Tuesday(this was all happening on a Friday!) I was already 1 day behind on having my meds, so to wait until Tuesay was horrible! By the grace of God, a friend asked her pain doctor to please see me, she told him what had happened and he agreed to see me on Monday. By the time I saw him I was so sick, I wanted to die. He pulled up my DEA sheet and saw what I had been prescribed, and all he was willing to prescribe what factored out to be a quarter of what my past regimen consisted of. He said he was not comfortable in giving me the doses I had been on for the past 4 years. I had no choice to take what he offered. To make a long story short, this last year has been a living hell, trying to make due with what he was willing to prescribe. I asked 3 different times if he would increase my dosage, but he told me basically, take what he gives or find another doctor. Now I have been recently diagnosed with Lymphoma, and had an MRI of my back done, which showed drastic changes, yet he refuses to help me. My question is this: Does anyone know of a good pain management doctor that would be willing to work with me? I live in a suburb of Detroit, and allthe doctors I have researched primarily do 'procedures', that is PT, injections and the like. I have done all of that with no relief. Because of an ongoing skin infection, I am not a candidate for any type of invasive procedure, that is why I ended up on a medication regimen only. Now with the abdominal pain which has been found to be from the Lymphoma. God only knows what the future holds for me pain wise. Please, if there is anyone out there that can recommend a doctor that would be willing to help me get back to my prior regimen. I would be willing to drive any distance just to get some relief. I would be forever grateful. Please help me, my time is limited, and I just can'do this anymore. Thank you for taking the time to read this, I apologize. "

I explained all of this to my ENT surgeon but he insisted I take the percocet with the same dosage (1-2 pills every 4-6 hours) for post-op pain. He did not want to increase the dosage or change the medication, and he says that he is giving me the maximum amount of medication possible. Due to my spine and disc issues, I already have somewhat of a tolerance to this medication which is why my post-op pain is not responding to it. I have been in severe, horrible pain for the past two days and have not slept due to the pain. My ENT doctor refuses to see me or change my medication. He told me to call my pain management doctor. I called my PM doctor, and the front desk person said that he would not prescribe for a pain issue that is not in his domain- and referred me back to my ENT doctor.  So basically my ENT doctor refuses to see me at all, and he instructed me to call my pain doctor who will not help me either (which is understandable because this is not his area of expertise).

Am I pregnant","I am on the Birth Control Pill Microgestin 1.5/30 and have been since April 2014. I am just curious if you miss pills and by chance you ovulate would that occur immediately after the pills are missed or a few days later, or would it be at the regular time that you would ovulate each month had you not been on BC pills?  I am a Sunday starter on my pills. I forgot to take my first pill in the pill pack on Sunday so I woke up the next morning and took it when I remembered. I also forgot to take the 4th pill and the 13th pill in my pack and again I took them immediately when I woke up on those days. The 13th pill was the last pill I missed in that pill pack. I AM NOT HAVEING SEX DURING THIS TIME. I continued taking the rest of the 8 pills left in my pack accurately and on time (with the exception that I took the 19th pill only 4 hours late). I am on a 21 day pack with no placebo pills. Instead of having my pill free week I went straight into another pack of active pills on sunday due to an upcoming trip. So at that point I had been taking 12 active pills with out error. I had sex on the trip and we for the most part used the pull out method along with my birth control pills as our protection. Although we did have sex back to back on some occasions, and I am aware that some sperm can stay in the urethra after a previous ejaculation. Only once did he ejaculate inside me, and I freaked out about that and took Plan B even though I didn't need it at that point. The day after that I fell asleep and missed my pill, I woke up took my pill and got Plan B again.  Is there any possible way that I could have ovulated on my trip due to the pills I missed in the last pack? or would that be impossible due to the fact that I had been taking 12 active pills correctly? Why I am concerned is that on the 13th day of taking active pills correctly (5th pill in the new pill pack, & first day on the trip) a few hours after sex I started experiencing minor cramps and breast tenderness. This continued through out the rest of the trip, but went away after the trip was over. A week after the trip I started experiencing some extreme pain in my mid to upper abdominal area and stabbing pain in my chest. I had previous problem with stomach ulcers/acid reflux, but heartburn is also a pregnancy symptom. I also started experiencing some diarrhea and it has worsened since being on my medication for Ulcers. Around that time I also noticed some raised little bumps on my areola. Now 2 weeks since the trip has ending I am experiencing some slight vaginal bleeding(brown). You can only slightly see it when I wipe after using the restroom. So again, if you miss pills and by chance you ovulate would that occur immediately after the pills are missed or a few days later, or would it be at the regular time that you would ovulate each month had you not been on BC pills? Was it possible for me to have ovulated during my trip and get pregnant even though I had taken 12 active pills correctly? Help would be greatly appreciated! "

Nothng he does helps except for the first time i took an anti-biotic called xifaxan has helped in the least. during the first 2 months after taking the xifaxan, i felt great for about two months. Now the xifxan doent work like it did the first time. And i am still hurting. I was taking metadone for 5 years with no intestial pain, but the gastro-doctor cant find out whats going on so he is of course blaming it on the methadone. How can methadone automatically start causing pain like this after over 5 years of use with no issues other than light constipation (normal methadone side effect). I now use a half a dose of mirilax (no- stimulant, non- dependant) every day and there is no constipation whatsoever anymore. I have simply never heard of anyone on methadone experienceing pain like this, but I am willing to try winging of of the methsdone to see if it actually helps. Probabaly wont help. but at least i can get my doctor to start looking past the Does suboxone cause same/worse constipation as methadone. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Ronald siegel, a psychopharmacologist at ucla said 'the widespread testing and reliance on tell-tale traces of drugs in the urine is simply a panic reaction invoked because the normal techniques for controlling drug use haven't worked very well. The next epidemic will be testing abuse. "" byrd labs has in its possession an internal document from the syva company, makers of the widely used emit test. This document, leaked by a disillusioned company employee, lists more than 250 over-the-counter medications and prescription drugs that can cause false positives.

Hair tests catch more blacks than whites drug tests bring worries of accuracy aclu complaints more than splitting hairs antibiotics cause false positives on heroin tests among the items reported as causing false positive test results are: pain relievers such as advil, nuprin, motrin and menstrual cramp medications like midol and trendar. All drugs containing the widely used pain reliever ibuprofen are known to cause positive samples for marijuana. Non-steroidal anti inflammatories such as naproxyn have cross reacted in blind tests. These are often prescribed for runners, sports injuries to joints, and those suffering from arthritis. Syva labs has recently reworked its cannabinoid test and claims to have eliminated this problem. But a science magazine article (july 8, 1988) lists ibuprofen as cross reactive. Under the new government guidelines thc testing levels will be reduced to 50 nanograms. Many more thc false positives can be expected in 1994. Dristan nasal spray, neosynephren, vicks nasal spray, sudafed, etc. And others containing ephedrine or pnenypropanolamine. Over the counter appetite suppressants which contain propanolamine. Most common nasal decongestants can cause a positive reading for amphetamines. As the cross reactive list suggests at the back of this booklet, amphetamine false positives are the most common. Recent articles in the journal of clinical chemistry ,vol. 38 no. 12 1992 and vol. 39 no. 3 1993 warn that medications containing chloropromazine, fluspirilene, and others may yield a positive when tested for amphetamines. Vicks formula 44m containing dextromethorphan, and primatene-m containing perylamine as well as the pain reliever demerol, and prescription anti-depressant elavil test positive for opiates up to three days. Even quinine water can also cause a positive reading for opiates. Poppy seeds such as the ones on a bagel from your favorite deli, etc. The journal of clinical chemistry vol. 33 no. 6, 1987 reports: ""the quantities of poppy seed ingested in this study (25 and 40 g) may be expected to be contained in one or two servings of poppy seed cake. Therefore, poppy seeds represent a potentially serious source of falsely positive results in testing opiate abuse. "" clinical chemistry goes on to conclude: not only is it difficult to distinguish heroin or morphine abuse from codeine, but dietary poppy seeds can give a strong positive result for urinary opiate of several days duration that is confirmed by gc/ms analysis"". Nyquil nighttime cold medicine will test positive for methadone up to two days. Antibiotics. Certain newly developed antibiotics have cause positive samples urine tests. Ampicillin is suspect. Amoxicillin has caused positives for cocaine. Diazepam tests positive for pcp as well as the ingredient in some cough medicines, dextromethorophan. Your own enzymes. A small fraction of the population excrete large amounts of certain enzymes in their urine which can produce a positive drug test. Dr. John morgan of the dept. Of pharmacology of new york city university writes: ""a false positive test could occur in some individuals because they excrete unusually large amounts of endogenons lysozyme or malate dehydrogenase. "" dr. Morgan judges that natural enzyme interference may run as high as 10% of positive samples. Black skin. This is not a joke! Those of african origin, certain orientals, or pacific islanders might test positive for marijuana. Dr. James woodford, a toxicologist associated with emory university labs hypothesized the pigment melanin which protects the skin from the sun, approximates the mlolecular structure of the thc metabolite to cross react on the marijuana urine test. Dark skinned caucasians such as those from the subcontinent of india could also read positive on marijuana tests. The body eliminates some melanin in a dark person's urine sample. Passive marijuana inhalation. If you attend a rock concert or ride in a car where marijuana is smoked nearby, even if you do not partake, the second hand marijuana that you might inhale may give your test a positive result for several days.

Pregnancy,https://www.drugs.com/answers/urgent-question-nuvaring-pregnancy-650157.html,Urgent question about Nuvaring and pregnancy?,"Ok I cannot figure out if I am pregnant or if Nuvaring has delayed my period? My period was scheduled for Jan 26, 2013. To start off my periods are never irregular periods, they almost always come on the time they are suppose to, and if they are late it wouldn't be more than a day ever. Even when I started birth control the hormones from that never effected my period being late or not showing up. I was on the regular birth control pill Sprintec, then I was on the Depo shot for a year. Even on Depo my period always came regular. I stopped Depo after about a year on it and for awhile I used no birth control, I did have some unprotected sex with my boyfriend for a couple of months however I never got pregnant and always had my regular period. So I went to my gyno recently and had a regular check up everything and I knew it was time for me it get birth control before I get pregnant. I decided on Nuvaring, I have never tried it before. I went to the Dr. on Jan 6th, 2013. My doctor had explain Nuvaring is usually inserted the first day of your menstrual cycle and then after your cycle is over it will have had time to take affect in the body. But I went on Jan 6th and I had already had my period, I got it on Dec 29th. She said I could still insert it that day and not wait however it would take about a week before it started working. So I did insert it on Jan 6th. And my Dr said I might have my period before I take the ring out and then have my period again when I take it out after 3 weeks. I said that was fine with me. However I did have unprotected sex with my bf once before the seven days the Nuvaring had been inserted. And about a week ago my breast started to be very sensitive, they have been burning and aching and feel swollen, this has been happening on and off now. It's very painful even wearing a thin shirt hurts. I don't know how this breast pain can be from my period because it's happened before it's time for it and my boobs never hurt when I have my period. Also even when i was on those different forms of birth control they never caused breast pain. I'm worried that could be a pregnancy sign. Has anyone had painful breasts from Nuvaring? Also I was suppose to get my regular period on Jan 26. Now it's the 27th and my period hasn't came?? It's never late. I feel light cramps every now and then but it doesn't feel like my period coming. Do you think maybe the Nuvaring is making it late because it's not time for me to take the ring out and have my period? My Dr. told me I would more than likely get my period before I take the ring out and get it again but I haven't and I'm worried because this never happens to me even with birth control. I was wondering if can take the Nuvaring out now even though i'm suppose to take it out in 3 days. I was thinking of taking it out now to check to see if my period comes and leaving it out for the week and inserting a new one after the week is up. Do you think if I take it out 3 days earlier and insert a new one 1 week later it would be ok? I know I should probably wait until the 3 days are up but I'm so worried I wanna take it out now to see if my period will come like it should. Should I take a test to see if i'm pregnant or is it to early because my period might now be scheduled to come after the ring is out for a week? Help, could I be pregnant? Has Nuvaring changed anyones else's period dates? I'm going to call my Dr. tomorrow when they are open and ask them if i should take a test or if I can take it out, by tomorrow i''ll only have to keep it in 2 days but I'm going crazy I don't feel like I can wait that long. But for now I wanted to know if anyone else went through any similar experiences with the ring? Or if anyone started the ring and didn't get their period at all anymore? Also has anyone experienced painful breasts on the ring? Sorry to type so much. "

Starting last week, I began to have waves of panic. Starting in the middle of the night. I saw my primary care and asked if plaquenil could be to blame. I do have anxiety disorder but have not had a panic attack in two years and certainly not waves of panic. I have since lost my appetite and can only eat a little. She said right away that she does not think it is the plaquenil and then suggested I see a psychiatrist. This didn't make me happy because I really feel that looking for more medication from someone else for sudden symptoms is not a wise choice. She gave me xanax to stop the panic. It helped me sleep but makes me way too tired during the day -- so it is like I am anxious, panicky, and exhausted now. I called my Rhuematalogist who I have only seen twice to ask if the plaquenil might be behind my sudden anxiety. I waited two days for a call back ( a long time when you are panicky). Finally, I called the office and got someone to call me back. A nurse said that my rheumatologist has never heard of plaquenil causing anxiety attacks. I commented that it is listed as a side effect and that they came out of the blue. She said he also said I should see my primary care. I want to believe in my doctor but I don't feel like either one of them bothered to really look into my concern. I think I will just stop the plaquenil and see if I get any relief and I will let him know what I have decided.

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/3600mg-day-rule-566762.html,Why is 3600mg per day the rule?,"Hi, I am new, and nice to meet you all!  I have been taking gabapentin for years for severe back, hip and knee pain due to RA and DGD and who knows what else after all this time. I take 900mg gabapentin and 100mg tramadol every six hours. I also take meloxicam 15mg once a day. I work on computer, at home, and I sit in a chair a lot of hours. Sometimes the pain is contained, but not if I have to walk around - I use two canes and sometimes crutches. I sleep in a recliner. I have not been able to lay in a bed for some years now. I rarely go out of the house because even with a shopping cart, it is exhausting and painful. Driving, sliding in and out of the seat, is a misery. My mind works great, though!  The only side effects I have is I do want to sleep when I take all my pills in the morning. I am a night owl and worker, so sleeping days is fine. I sometimes need a boost to stop the pain. My doctor told me to take two tramadol in the middle of the six hours, but often what I need is the gabapentin. Nope, the limit per day is what you get, says the doctor. And if I need more pain relief I will have to give up what I take now and move over to a narcotic. No way. I was addicted to prescription drugs when I was hospitalized over 30 years ago. I have been clean for 30 years. I am not going back there.  So why can't I have more gabapentin if it will help me? I don't understand this 'rule/law' -- I do take it when I need to. Not frequently, but when I have to have it, I don't think twice and I take another dose of gabapentin and tramadol a couple of hours early. I am fine. No problems.  My doctor, who knows my history, is willing to put me on narcotics rather than help me with the gabapentin in a higher dose. I find this to be craziness. Kind of like the government forcing Vioxx off the market - the drug that allowed me to keep walking with hardly any pain. (I would have gladly signed a release to keep taking it!) So what's the scoop? That no one has tested the higher dosage seems weird to me, when it can surely help so many people. I would volunteer. Thank you! "

I haven't been in these forums since June when I was struggling with the induction. Been on 16 mgs from the start. Hate it but scared to go off them because of pain. But now since I have been dx with gout, I really believe that subs had something to do with it. I am in so much pain and my doc will begin weaning me this week. Robert, I'm also on Coumadin... and I know you are so well read and experienced so I wonder if you can help with a question? Mainly, since I have noticed that the subs made my joints hurt like hell and my feet swell since being on them, do you think it can bring on gout? I've never had it before now, I tested positive for the blood test they use (measures uric acid in blood) and I wonder if even though you aren't a coumadin expert, can you help me investigate whether or not coumadin worsens gout symptoms? I ask this because I read that aspirin makes gout worse since its a blood thinner, so I logically think that coumadin must do ten times the damage. Thanks Robert, gosh. I forget how to message you personally. Sorry... and yes, I have your taper and intend on following it. My doc is open to it as well as he says none of the doctors really have any training on this drug and he'll value what other people are finding to be true when it comes time to taper. Also, SUBOXONE DISCOUNT 75 OFF CARDS... I am self pay and can only afford one weeks worth at a time, and the company won't let me use the card anymore. A message comes back that I've been using the card too much for the discount. Also... does anyone out there see the very big difference with the strips in the last month or so? Like that they are thinner and so brittle now that they break even before the package is opened. Not only that, remember how they warned us (clever of them since the patten was expiring) how the strips are actually stronger than the tabs? Does anyone else out there see why the created the (uber) film strips that are waaay stronger than the tabs and gave us all a discount card so we wont go to any generics that they may come out with? Only now, a few months later, the strips are def way weaker. To me, it appears that they are really trying to get us hooked big time by letting everyone know that they are quite stronger than the SL tabs?

Then 2 years ago new pain from multiple disc deterioration - told to wait (years?) for surgery and focus on pain management for the foreseeable future - exercise and meds...

I sit down at my job for over 10 hours a day and that proves to be as painful as standing for awhile. The only relief I get is when I'm sitting with my legs elevated. I've been seeing a neuro for a short while; he cut back my Gabapentin to 300mg 3x's a day but started me on Lamictal instead. This week he is conducting an EMG/NCV to test my nerves and muscles. I feel like he is the right physician for me as he seems to care and is willing to try different things to improve my situation. Since I've switched meds the intense pain that I used to feel in the middle of the day and early evenings had lessened. However, it's much harder to go to sleep and once I wake up I have a really hard time falling back to sleep due to the pain. I attribute this to cutting back from 900mg of Gaba to 300mg at night. So there has been some positve changes and some negative changes.  This problem has steadily gotten worse over the last 5 years. But the last year has increased in pain and numbness exponentially. I was unable to plan a family vacation this summer as I didn't know what kind of vacation involved sitting with my legs up all of the time. But my whole family is going to DisneyWorld next year and I've promised my girls that my handicap will NOT affect their vacation. My sister and I have discussed my getting a wheel chair or perhaps a walker as this vacation will require a lot of walking. However, other people say, ""Well when you get this under control, you won't have to worry about it."" This leads to my question, ""Is this like cancer - where it will go in to remission? Or diabetes, where if you practice all of the precautions you can live an almost normal life?"" Is there a chance next spring I can go to DW and be able to walk the same as anyone else my age? Any thoughts? Thanks for all of your help! B "

I am also on some others meds for heart disease, JUNE/05th/2015 i have a new [saint jude mitral valve]. the meds are, degoxin,baby asprin, metropoline, warfarin-[4mg per day, 5mg ON mon and fri.] lisinopril-10mg by any chance is there something someone at the VA should have told me about interaction with any or all of the MEDS listed? one thing for sure, it is sometimes almost impossible to keep up with the drugs they got ya taking, let alone all of them that are out there. and sure seems that there are many. ALmost forgot, i am post surgery, and have arthritis on my spine, this being the doc gave me TRAMADOL in the first place, i informed him nothing otc was working and he gave me this for ""pain management"" ill say this for the drug, it does help tins with the pain, for me anyway, and at this seemly low dose.  my prays go out to all those in pain, and need much higher doses of whatever they do take, and to those that have to go thru the withdrawals getting off from them whatever they were taking. i cannot even imagine what type of pain would cause someone to take such a high level/dose of those meds, and pray that me and others never have a first hand experience with this level of pain.  i hope i included all, and said it with the right words, but you all know what i mean.  thank you.

Desperate with severe chronic leg pain 24/7?,"Hello, I came across your post because I have been seeking help for almost 10 years now for CHRONIC leg pain. I was diagnosed in 2006 with Ulcerative Colitis very badly. I initially started on a extremely high dose of IV prednisone which actually did not help enough to calm my UC down so the doctors then put me on Remicade. Within less than 24hrs of getting the very 1st remicade infusion, I tried to stand that morning in the hospital and couldn't. I wound up crying in pain and hysterically scared and upset. I then noticed for the next 3-4 treatments of Remicade I received over the next few months back then my leg pains got increasingly worse. Since 2006 I have had extensive workups, tests, imaging, bloodwork, the list is endless. The Remicade was stopped after the 3-4th try due to the severity of pain in both legs. The orthopedist and rheumatologist then both Diagnosed me in 2009 with Avascular Necrosis (AVN) and stated it was from the Prednisone and NOT the Remicade. In 2010 my right knee collapsed and I went in for a total knee replacement. Mind you I am currently now 33 so this all started when I was around 23 years old. I have had numerous rheumatologic workups and tests and will be going back to the Hospital for Special Surgery for a 3rd opinion now in 2 weeks to see if they can figure out the reasoning behind the pain. I have been on intensive pain management since 2006 and nothing is truly helping. On top of the AVN & Chronic daily leg pains I have: Chronic Migraines since I was 12 years old. Pan-Ulcerative Colitis, Hypothyroidism and anxiety and depression. So all in all I have A LOT going on. But nothing right now can compare to the daily leg pain that is over a 10 out of a 1-10 scale with 10 being unbearable. The knee replacement did not help me or the pain one bit. I don't know what information you have successfully found or worked with but I would love to hear more input from you or anyone else battling with the same or similar situations with the horrific bilateral leg pain starting in both knees and radiating up and down both legs 24/7-365 days a year, 7 days a week from sunrise to sunset.  Thank you. "

Not fungal?,"About 10 years ago I noticed that my right big toe nail had a deep dark orange circle on it. I thought it was a fungal thing so I went to the doctor. She gave me lamasil, but after a month my mom made me stop taking it because it was bad for the liver or something and it looked like it was getting worse. I tried using creams and soaking it in peroxide and a few other over the counter medications but nothing helped. It wasn't causing me pain or anything so I just forgot about it after a year or so. The entire nail at this point was just a very light yellow and kind of crusty underneath and very brittle. After I joined the Air Force I decided to go to a dermatologist and try to get it fixed again because it was pretty ugly. He cut some of the nail away and said that it certainly looked fungal to him, but to be sure he sent it to the lab for testing. About 2 weeks later they called me and said it wasn't fungal and I must have done something to traumatize the nail. I found that pretty hard to believe, because I've never injured my foot before at all. Anyway he offered to surgically remove the nail in a way that it wouldn't grow back. I declined because it wasn't causing me any pain and I'd rather not have surgery for a purely aesthetic reason. Now, about 5 years later from my second doctors appointment I pretty much just rip the thing off every 3 months. There is no pain, and the entire nail pulls away with ease. It's pretty gross, but other than that it doesn't really cause my any discomfort. Also, I should mention that I do have a very slight case of eczema that comes and goes, the worst case being on the tip of my middle right finger for about 3 months. It seemed kind of like I had scales on it and I could peel the skin away. I haven't seen it since the first time it happened. My other nails have no signs of yellowing and I've never had a fungal infection anywhere else on my body. Could this be something else, do you guys think it might be fungal and the lab results were incorrect? I have a video of me ripping the nail off if needed. "

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/difference-between-iv-fentanyl-iv-dilaudid-makes-3343207.html,Difference between how IV fentanyl versus IV Dilaudid makes you feel?,"Hello! Long time reader, first time poster! I have severe Endometriosis and recently, this has been the absolute worst year I've dealt with it in the ten years of having it. Unfortunately, I've been hospitalized at least once a month (if not more), for at least a week at a time, for the past 12 months. I'm miserable.  With that being said, I'm wondering if anyone has advice or the same feelings with these two medications as I do. Outside of the hospital, I'm on the 75mcg fentanyl patch and change it every 48 hours and it works really well and helps control my pain... unless I'm on my period then it feels as if I'm taking nothing.  When I've been given IV fentanyl push, I legitimately don't feel a difference. I don't even feel any sort of evidence of it like a small high, sleepiness, etc. I'm also including IV fentanyl that I've been given right before surgery. I definitely don't feel the fentanyl but feel the lidocaine and Propofol.  Then, when I take my Dilaudid pill for breakthrough pain, I don't notice much of a difference, if one at all. However, when given IV Dilaudid, I instantly feel that warm fuzzy feeling of a small high (I maintain that the high I feel is because my pain level is finally beneath at least a 7, if only for a few minutes).  So, I guess my question is, does anyone else not get a high when given IV fentanyl but use the fentanyl patch and have success with it? I usually don't even notice a pain difference when given IV fentanyl the way I do with IV Dilaudid. I've heard fentanyl is stronger than Dilaudid so I'm very confused why this doesn't work. Perhaps the dose is too small? But they give such a high dose for surgery and I still don't notice it? I'm only asking because I want to better communicate with my doctors and wanted to see if others had this same type of experience!  Thank you and I'm sorry for the long post! Any feedback is helpful!

Suffering MONTHS,"I am a single mom to a absolutely gorgeous 2 year old daughter. my doctor has done EVERY test on me in the books. my kitchen counter resembles the pain medication isle in the drug store. i have tried EVERYTHING for pain and nothing helps- except for narcotic pain medicines! :( (why cant they come up with medication for pain that isn't a narcotic already!!! ) i have been on bed rest for the past 2 weeks and my pain level has only gone down from an 8 to a 7. i have no appetite and cant cook anyway because lifting and chopping hurt my wrists too much. unfortunately i have had to go the illegal route which is terrible because i dont want any trouble with the law... but my doctor doesn't take me seriously. i dont know if she even believes me, but there have been weeks where i call her nurse nearly every day crying in pain and all they tell me is to sit in a hot tub. i have DEMANDED a referral to the mayo because i need to know what is wrong with me! the pain started shortly after giving birth to my daughter in my arms and neck- i assumed it was from holding her all the time and breastfeeding and hoped it would eventually go away... well, it hasn't. its been 2 years and is only escalating. it has escalated to a level i didn't think was possible!!!  I am worried about my mental health now too because enduring this pain day after day, minute after minute is driving me insane. i haven't been able to care for my daughter the past 2 weeks. fortunately i have very caring neighbors and they have been taking care of her for me.. but it cant go on like this forever plus I MISS HER SOOOOO MUCH! all of this mental and emotion strain is killing me. and being in constant pain doesn't help either. i dont even know how soon ill be able to get into the mayo. I am just hoping they can finally give me some answers. i cant imagine they would just shrug their shoulders and tell me its all in my head (which in fact, is what my rheumatologist did to me!!! ) my symptoms are aching/throbbing/burning neck and upper back (shoulder area) its also in both arms from my elbows to my wrists and sometimes my hands and fingers too. i feel extremely weak all the time.  i eat maybe once a day and its never very much but I've actually put on weight. i have a neurologist appointment on Tuesday but even that feels like weeks away since all i can do is lay here and suffer until then. my doctor used to per scribe me Vicodin and Percocet but then stopped since they weren't finding any medical reason for the pain. i feel like i am going crazy. I would switch doctors but it seems like too much work and i dont want to have to go through all these tests and waiting again and I am not sure if my mayo referral would still be valid if i did that..  does anyone have any experience with ANYTHING like this? oh- i actually did find one thing that did help somewhat - its called ""krontom"" and i bought it on amazon.com. I am waiting for another shipment but even expediting it will only get it here by Tuesday.  plus its pretty expensive and i have basically no money now since I've blown it all on OTC ""remedies"" from blue emu oil to Doans backache pills to icy hot patches, to replacing the electrodes on my tens unit (which by the way is a huge pain in the ass and doesn't even relieve my pain. so if anyone knows anyone or anywhere i can get this stuff legally or at a fair price, god bless you. i cannot fully express to you the suffering I have been going through and i feel like i am quickly approaching my wits end!! thank you and god bless.

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/long-term-affects-tramadol-overdose-3435271.html,What are the long term affects or a tramadol overdose?,"I’ve tried to find an answer to this but I can’t seem to find any information on the longer term effects.  I had previously been prescribed 100mg tramadol slow release for chronic pain 5+yrs ago, it didn’t agree with me and I didn’t sleep whilst I was on it, leading to amytriptiline, celecoxib and codeine being added on top. I stopped it soon after being prescribed.  On Wednesday of this week (16 Aug), due to mental health issues, I took 1000mg so 10x100mg over a two hour period 16.00-18.00 with half a bottle of champaign (it’s all we had!). I haven’t found any info of anyone taking that much on here.  I was admitted to hospital later that night at about 21.30. I was semi awake, no seizures at all, tachy cardic, clammy sweats, cold skin and slight depressed breathing, raspy breathing, VERY VERY ITCHY. No stomach pains, no vomiting. It was hard to pee and I only passed water once in hospital. I was in no pain whatsoever and my pain level is usually between 5-7 on a good day, no pain continued into Thursday.  I was given an ECG, blood pressure checks and pulse. Blood was taken but no other treatment was given. No drugs, no stomach pump, absolutely nothing else. I was kept in over night and discharged mid afternoon on Thursday, where I basically slept for 24hrs.  This is NHS Wales so my expectations are not high BUT no advice was given on how I might feel, I asked about long term damage and they said there wouldn’t be any, didn’t say I was lucky and were matter of fact. I was briefly seen by a counsellor but I have my own already. I was referred to mental health Wales and a letter was sent to my GP. My GP did not call me the next day as they suggested.  The following day (Friday) I carried on as usual, I saw my counsellor, went to the gym and my usual sleeping problems and chronic pain came back. Half thought I had imagined the whole thing.  I thought briefly perhaps I shouldn’t work out. I have a heart rate monitor and noticed my heart rate was elevated more than usual during this workout, I also had tight, sort of squeezing in my chest, not enough to seek medical attention though. I have a productive chesty cough but I could have picked up something in hospital as I have a compromised immune system and my ribs hurt in my back, between my shoulder blades. Again that could be a sign of infection. Dry mouth, dry nose with bleeding and very dry skin.  My question is what is this going to do to me long term? Are the doctors right in that it won’t affect me at all? I hadn’t taken this drug in 5+yrs so I wasn’t at all tolerant to it. Could have lost it’s potency? How long will it take to be completely out of my system?  This is not a ‘how did I fail’ question, I have access to various drugs and quite able to google which to take.  I’m a 38yr old female with MBL deficiency, ulcerative colitis, chronic pain linked to the UC, asthma. History of chronic depression, PTSD and anxiety. No treatment for the latter besides counselling.  Thanks for any thoughts on this. "

I was only prescribed two 50 mg per day which did absolutely nothing so I gradually increased to 3 & then 4 & then 5 or six AT A TIME... Only that amount eased my pain. Needless to say, my monthly prescriptions only lasted about 10 days but I never had adverse symptoms from not having them... Just had to rely on ibuprofen & suffer til I could get my prescription refilled. My Dr told me Tramadol was only used to treat mild pain & were considered mild pain relievers. I had been on that regimen for a couple years & then I guess I hit a plateau & 6 were not working anymore so I took 6 initially in the morning & then a few more in the afternoon before eating... They also reduced my appetite which I liked them for as well... Then I had a grand mal seizure! I was never told that was a side effect. I was rushed to the hospital, they did a cat scan & found nothing, told me it was from low potassium levels and extreme stress. so I was referred to a neurologist. I never went to a neurologist because we don't have insurance. So I just went under the assumption that it was due to heavy stress from our business and tax season and marital problems & the like and so continued with my same routine and then a month later I had another grand mal seizure, was rushed by ambulance again to the hospital and they put me on Keppra which is an anti-seizure medication because they thought I had developed adult onset epilepsy (2 or more seizures is considered epilepsy i was told), told me my potassium was low again and again referred me to a neurologist. I cannot get an appointment for a month. So my question is does anyone think that it really is adult onset epilepsy or that it does have something to do with the tramadol? I do not want to be on epilepsy medication if I don't have epilepsy. Extremely high stress levels right before both episodes & extremely low potassium have been considered the culprit. But I don't know if it is a combination of things or if anyone else has had anything similar happen? Thank you in advance for any insight :-) "

A mad woman, one of those, I'm checking my whole house like a fool looking for a norco that doesn't exist. Anyways here is the situation... The last 2 times I have ran out of meds about 4 days till fill time. Last time my doctor approved the early refill because it was the first time i have ever been short. He prescribed me more because I admitted I was taking 10 a day. I was on average but sometimes 12 a day. Now I am out early again by 4 days and so he is going to fill them but not until tomorrow. It's 3 days into cold turkey no norco and I really don't feel that bad. I don't want to take them anymore and I know my script will be waiting tomorrow.

Following urination the urgency symptoms go into overdrive, despite an empty bladder. I have been tested for urinary track infections - negative. I have done a candida cleanse and have begun eliminating foods that encourage candida growth. I have been tested for a variety of chemical and food allergies - negative. Two chemicals were identified as allergens CARBA MIX (diphenylguanidine, zincdibutyldithiocarbamate, zincdiethyldithiocarbomate) and Thimerosal (merthiolate). Some foods did have reactions when test patches were removed (and those corresponded with foods, I suspected I had allergies to), however the following day when test sites were officially read, non of my suspectic allergens were positively identified. I suspect I have food sensitivities for those foods, but I have also had them with no cystitis symptoms, and I've eaten them my entire life with no cystitis symptoms.

For the past two years I have taken one or two pills a day for a week or so then skip a few weeks and then back to taking the medication again. Sometimes I would just take the medication here and there, take it one day skip a few days and then take it again. I took my medication like that for two years and it never bothered me.  I started a job that requires heavy lifting back in August of 2010. Since I started this job I have been taking my medication every day and I'm now up to three pills a day (150 MG). Tremadol doe's not give me a high or make me feel good, it doe's take my pain away and it doe's a great job at doing that. Last week I skipped a day because I didn't think I needed it. The next day my shoulders started hurting, my legs got very restless, and I felt worn down. I was like this for the whole day. that night I took the Tramadol and within two hours the restless leg went away as well as the shoulder pain and the feeling of being worn down. I didn't think anything about this, I took my medication for another week and then I stopped again. The next day the feeling of being worn down with the restless leg was back.

My doc (bless his heart!) just changed my dose and I'm just so thrilled to report that me twigs have been gradually getting a bit better, the stinging, stabbing and burning pain, and let's not forget the electric shock type pain that makes ya squeak like a mouse, is better!  Today will be the tenth day on my gabapentin dose switcheroo, and I'm SO very grateful!! Yet, I do have some funky side effects, the MAJOR side effect is idiocy or I suppose I should use the words ""Cognitive Impairment"" : ). I can sit at my desk, typing an email and the right word, or phrase won't come to me until the middle of the night, where I shoot up in bed, into a sitting position and want to write the proper term on paper, and gang, SOMETIMES I DO, at 4am! (That's why I've been at my desk since 4am THIS morning!) Also, gabapentin either gets me revved up, like an Arabian horse, ready to fly thru the desert! (Or is that dessert, as I've gained a bunch of unwanted pounds! UGH!) It either cranks me up or it makes me Dopey or Sleepy, yes, like Snow White and the Seven Little People, well I can't write ""Dwarves"" as it's not politically correct, now is it? (I don't want to offend folk and have to write an Open Letter of Apology yet again!) My Xanax can't even calm down my ""Arabian horse nerves"", which is really a pain in the arse, but I can accomplish a lot more than I used to when my Arabian horse hours hit, a lot comparatively speaking, as the Fibromyfriggin'algia keeps me in some amount of pain. OK, it keeps my muscles cramping and tight and the nerves in my legs twitching and jumping, which is VISIBLE to the naked eye. Yuck. And the loveliest of all, weight gain, yes it's finally hit me! The Wall of Flab has gotten the best of me and it seems that no amount of starving, walking, dancing can keep it away! Heavy sigh! So, my husband and my bestie have both said to let it go, not to be so vain, for what I'm experiencing (or should I say NOT experiencing?) at this time is a miracle!  To sum up, OR if you didn't want to read all the stuff above, here's the straight scoop...  A) Gabapentin is working @ 300mgs, 3 times a day, lessening the neurop.  B) I'm a nincompoop, now (although my brothers and some folk on this site would argue that I've been that way all my life : )! I must HUNT for words! (I used to have a vast vocab, frustrating!) C) I'm as hyper as a 9 year old on a sugar buzz and as skittish as an Arabian. D) Weight gain, ugh, ugh, oh NO! NO! (What goes around, comes around!) I've a theory, there's a certain amount of fat in the world and we all trade it, depending upon whom is eating Maple Pecan Ice Cream and the girls that are currently starving themselves.

This past year, I went through a phase where I was forgetting to take it and before I knew it, I hadn't taken it in months. All the old depression and anxiety symptoms returned with a vengeance and I started taking 20mg again. For two weeks after starting back on the 20mg, I've had terrible headaches, dizziness and nausea. I stopped taking it and felt better. I went to see my psych and she started me on 10mg. I've been on the 10mg four about 9 days now and the side effects aren't as bad as when I was on the 20mg, I don't have the nausea, but I still have the extreme dizziness and headaches - and don't even want to think about going up to 20mg yet. As far as the depression goes, I already feel much better, but I don't know how much longer I can tolerate the dizziness. Should I just be more patient or is it time to think about changing to a different medication? My psych suggested switching to Lexapro but everything I've read about it sounds like it is very similar to Prozac. "

I was diagnosed with shingles Oct 5, 2012 on forehead and scalp; left eye swollen hideously. I was put on acyclovir and a round of steroids prescribed by ER physician. The actual crusting and healing of those lesions occurred within 3-4 weeks. After that I itched so severely on my scalp that I broke down in frustration and scratched vigorously to the point of making sores. I found a primary dr that I could barely afford and was given another round of acyclovir and 100 mg neurontin orally every 8 hrs. The sores on scalp have yet to go away. Once the scabs get so dry they itch and scratching causes the scabs to break loose along their edges. I tried keeping antibiotic ointment on the scabs so they didn't dry to the point of itching, but all that happened was that large, moist edges pulled free and because it never quits itching I end up scratching off most of the scabs, leaving sores that will be more scabs - a vicious cycle. This has gone on for 5+ months now and there is no relief in sight. I now take 100mg neurontin every 6 hrs and the doctor said there's a good chance I will have to take neurontin for the rest of my life.

Pruritus,https://www.drugs.com/answers/benzodiazepine-withdrawal-itching-leg-edema-normal-3131650.html,Benzodiazepine withdrawal - Itching and leg edema normal?,"My doctor started tapering me off of clonazepam 2 weeks ago. I had only been taking it about 6 months, .5mg 2x a day. He had me cut one of those doses in half only. I figured it wouldn't be a big deal, but oh my god, the symptoms. It's not anxiety, but a whole host of physical symptoms I wasn't expecting after being on such a low dose for such a short time, and only reducing it by .25 mg a day. I'm itchy from head to toe, my skin is breaking out with acne (not even just my face, but my entire body) way worse than even when I was a teenager, and I have swelling in my ankles and feet (which I've never experienced before). While my anxiety is not at panic levels (it was, after losing my dad, which is what got me started on this hellish drug in the first place), I am by nature an anxious person, and so even though the doctor tells me all of these symptoms are probably just from the tiny reduction in my clonazepam dose, it's hard to not freak out. And of course, the internet assures me it's kidney failure or liver failure or cancer or lupus, or something equally terrifying. The acne I can deal with, that doesn't worry me overly much, but the swelling in my legs and the itching are scary, not to mention make me miserable just about every second of the day--especially the itching. I've ruled out environmental factors, tried Benadryl and lots of lotion, drinking lots of water, etc, because supposedly clonazepam withdrawal can cause dehydration, but have seen no difference. So... those of you who have tapered off this med, is this really normal? I feel like this is an insane amount of side effects for what seems like such an insignificantly small change in meds that I wasn't even on for that long, and my doctor's lack of concern about everything else is making my anxiety go through the roof, convinced I'm dying of something they won't bother to investigate. Should I push for further testing? Get a second opinion? Is this normal and I just need to ride it out? I don't know what to do, but I'm miserable right now "

Panic Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/ptsd-panic-attacks-general-anxiety-depression-666053.html,"PTSD (panic attacks, general anxiety, depression, flashbacks, etc.) now coming to a resolution?","I just want to let my friends and anyone who is interested on drugs.com know where I'm at right now in regards to my PTSD. I've posted in a response last week about this, but really would like to share with you all. I seem to be coming to a conclusion, able to stop almost all meds. Ever since my severe decline in which it felt like I had begun a non-stop fall, I had luckily been put back on my feet with heavy use of medication. 6 mg of Klonopin, 200mg Zoloft, 4mg Minipress, another alpha blocker (forgot the name), 250 mg (?) Nuvigil, 300 mg Tramadol, 50 mg of Quetiapine, and 35 mg of Methadone. This is what I was taking a few months ago (unless I forgot one - oh yah, meds for migraines). Once these piles of medications put me back on my feet I started a vigorous routine of practicing the Martial Arts at home. I have been involved with this Art for almost 20 years now, therefore not really needing an instructor to practice the variety of forms as well as several weapons (katana, manrikigusari, tanto, o-wakizashi, bo, etc.) that I have learned. Ever since I had become sick with PTSD, Chronic Pain and etc. this was an activity that I had stopped. Now that I practice twice a day almost every day I found my need for medication has completely dropped out. By decreasing the dose at a very very slow rate (so that I don't get rebound effects, something that can easily alter a persons perception of still needing a medication) I have come to feel better every day, able to wake up in the morning and feel good (vs. being so tiered that it literally hurts). I have dropped the Klonopin down to 1 mg, 75 / 50 mg of Zoloft, 100 mg Tramadol, no more need for the Nuvigil, no more need for the Quetiapine, and 1 mg of the Minipress. The chronic pain however remains completely untouched. Any decrease doesn't cause withdrawals right away, however cause for the sensation of several nails punctured allover the body (good times). As I have stated I am not off my meds as of yet (not including the methadone) but so far have been extremely successful in the reduction. I am verging on stunned that by simply practicing a combo of Aikido, Karate (various styles), as well as several other forms, it has not only replaced my need for medication, but works much better as I feel more clear than I have for the last seven years or so. As the meds decrease I feel like a blur both emotionally as well as physically is in process of being lifted. I know that each and every person's body chemistry is different, however in my case this art is nothing more than a moving meditation and has put my symptoms to a halt. It really feels like I'm fighting demons. When I don't practice daily I can feel my energy slip as well as my mental condition, thus it really does feel like a demon is trying to regain it's strength and re-enter my body (I know it's not literally demons, but does feel like something on those lines). Luckily this is something that I love doing. The one thing that I am completely baffled by is the chronic pain, totally untouched by anything that I do. No matter what my diet may be, what physical exercise and or meditation that is done, it doesn't change even in the most slightest of ways.  Once again, everyone is different and I know that my story would not ring true for many. I am comfortable enough with the martial arts that I can practice at home without an instructor (not by any means saying that I've mastered any one of the arts as there is no such thing). However, due to my level of comfort it is much easier for me to utilize this art in a meditative way unlike when I first was learning, just trying to understand the movements. I also had gone regularly to a Buddhist temple years ago and am very familiar with meditation (Buddhism is a philosophy, not a religion btw).  I just wanted to share this update with you. I am so happy to have finally found what looks like a light at the end of a tunnel. A tunnel that for so long had me bound in chains. Finally the chains have crumbled apart and I've been able to move forward, slowly of course so that I don't trip. It looks like I might be able to achieve my long term goal, one that I had not in my heart felt it to be possible. PTSD has been the most challenging thing that I've had to deal with in my life so far, and am glad to have finally found a way to fight back. Thanks! Jeff K "

I'm sensitive to most antibiotics so the doc gave me Flotran (might be wrong name, it's an anti-nausea drug). All through the two courses had much itching under my tummy and leg crease by the groin (and the vagina area too). Took Benadryl like clockwork and that worked. When I stopped, thought all the itching it this area would disappear ... and it did for a while. A week or so after stopping the Keflex (and the anti-nausea meds) got a rash on my leg, looked it up and yes this does happen with Keflex. It cleared up (again with the Benadryl) after a week.  I've always had hives, but it's still centered on the leg crease and under tummy. Can Keflex mess up your system. I'm wonder if it's like thrush only on my tummy. I do get rashes there it I don't wash after exercise or sweating.  Mom says it's finding the weakest area and causing the rash/itches there.

The wounds are still open and packed (I get the last repacking technically today, then Friday the packing is removed for good, though the wounds will stay open for them to drain and heal on their own), so obviously I can't use anything topical for the itching... and I CAN'T ITCH IT!!! On top of that, my psoriasis is broken out like crazy all over my body, and it's worst around my waistline, and even that's itching like crazy now, with a rash starting. I really think it's the MRSA infection causing this and NOT the clindamycin, as I've taken it many times over the years with no problem. Besides, I CAN'T be allergic to it, it's the only MRSA-fighting antibiotic I'm not allergic to and I have chronic MRSA infections! As a side note, I seem to develop an allergy to any medical adhesive on my body with the strongest grip. This last time, the only adhesive on my body was my Duragesic patches and I developed an allergic rash when my infected abscess kicked into high gear and had to go from 200mcg/hr fentanyl patches to 200mg morphine ER every 8 hours (anyone know if that's roughly equivalent? I know how to convert TO fentanyl, but not FROM it to another opiate). Is there anything I can orally take for the itching? I swear, this itching is almost as bad as the pain!!! Luckily, I had the option of general anesthesia for the I&D, the doctor said it's overkill, but I think he realized that my reaction, or lack thereof, to local anesthetics is NOT all in my head after he did the procedure and woke up in agonizing pain despite the fact that they injected local anesthetics into the area while I was under. Would Benadryl touch it? Should I call my PCP and have him call in an RX for hydroxyzine to the pharmacy for me?

The itch will go away if I pay absolutely no attention to it but as soon as I thought about it the itch would come back. After a while I noticed the the getting worse. So far to the point that any sort of itching cream could only help for maybe a few seconds of relief. We found the under side of both my feet had begun to peel all and any callus up and my foot would begin to itch when a new piece would peel up. So I went to the doctor and they ruled out athletes foot. They began to think it a hydration problem and also decided to try and soften the callus under my feet with a stuff called callex. It worked to provide relief for a few weeks but soon these blisters began showing up. I wouldn't have noticed them except my boyfriend said usually when you have an itch that there is a bump so I looked. Sure enough there was a tiny tiny little bump. If you itched it the worse the itch got. But when some skin peeled up it broke the top of the bump and a little clear fluid came ip. The itch stopped. Then a couple days later about 6 more little bumps showed up. I now have almost no callus including on my toes and the little bumps still show up.

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/liver-question-911235.html,Please help! :D Liver Question!?,"Hi all! I had a question, for the past couple of months (since late September) my doctor has had me on Norco 7.5/325 for Lordosis in my cervical vertebrae (recently upped to 10/325). As you know, this has tylenol in the formula. I never take more than 1000 mg of Tylenol in these pills at a time (usually to control the pain I take 2 of the pills equaling 650 mg of tylenol per day). I take this medicine nearly daily unless I'm planning on drinking alcohol. If I drink alcohol during the day I do not take the medication b/c I don't want to chance the liver risk. I always allow 12 hours between taking the Norco and ingesting alcohol (per a pharmacist that I spoke to). My question is if I have taken the medicine for this long (almost 4 months, close to daily) but I have never exceeded the recommended daily dose of tylenol (not even close!) and have never drank alcohol and tylenol together in the same 12+ hours am I at risk for chronic liver damage or disease? I freak out about all of the little symptoms:  1) I have had an intense sweet craving the past couple days (sometimes they say this is related to liver damage, I thought of attributing this to the fact that I had two giant cokes (normally I drink the mini cokes) the past couple of mornings, so I have messed up my blood sugar for the day, forcing me to crave more sugar. I have had problems with hypoglycemia (non-liver disease related) but I don't usually crave sugar unless it is in the form of Coca Cola :p). 2) I have had pale stools gross I know sorry! (yellowish/orange/light brown, I also have GERD and I know this is one of the symptoms of that.) 3) Other than that, I haven't really had any other symptoms of liver damage. My skin gets itchy sometimes but that's only as a side effect when I take the narcotics. I rarely get nauseous and never vomit. My skins is normal colored and my eyes are white as egg shells (not jaundiced). I do get tired a lot but I have a very demanding schedule which I believe causes this.  My question is: Anyone who knows anything about tylenol and how it interacts with the body in this way please let me know if you think my behaviors have caused damage to my body? Please please help & no judgment! <3 "

No real terrible side effects for the first 4 days, just my fingers and toes getting a little cold/tingly along with my left arm. I will admit I took it off and on for the first 3 days because I wasn't on a very great schedule and needed to fix it before I started taking it regularly. Yesterday I woke up at 7:00, took 20mg of adderall and everything went great. Today I woke up at the same time. However, I've noticed pulsating, or jumpy, sharp pains around where the xiphoid and sternum meet. The pain seems to come in little blips or pulses, and only lasts for less than 30 seconds, but has happened multiple times today between 11:30 and now, 3:40. The first time I experienced it today, around 11:30, I happened to be having a particularly heated debate with a few online acquaintances. The situation was slightly stressful and or anxiety inducing, so i'm curious if that's the cause. I will admit I've been a bit anxious since experiencing it first, so I wouldn't be surprised if this is exasperating the sensation. I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and I had an EKG done 2 years ago. The EKG revealed nothing too harmful, just a minor heart ""condition"" similar to, but less severe than, mitral valve prolapse. Though from what I've read, not even mitral valve issues would be a cause for complications with adderall. My main questions are: Is this something that I should be concerned about or is it just part of starting adderall? They told me I would feel weird the first few times taking it, but I just want to be sure this isn't something more serious. Also, Has anyone else experienced something like this when starting adderall? Thank you for your time.  Edit: I'm also an 18 year old male if it matters. "

(trapped nerved in neck at c6 with screaming pain in shoulder and loss of sensation / reflexes in arm lower arm and thumb and two fingers. However, unbeknown to my doctor (as the work of trauma specialists does not seem to have filtered down to GP level in uk) I have been advised that I have 'toxic stress' following severe childhood trauma ie my 'flight / fight' adrenalin and cortisol button are in the 'ON' position as the default setting. I have always suffered from insomnia but Drs won't prescribe sleeping meds as they're addictive. My dr is only concerned about the physical pain in my shoulder and the nerve damage but when I took one pregabalin (25mg) the feeling of being so 'spaced' , my legs were buckling underneath me, my heart was beating out of my chest and I just felt I was out of control and felt like I was just grinning and drooling like the village idiot and the feelings of loss of control scared the crap out of me! So... I'm about to take another one as this nerve pain is unbearable but I'm scared that because of this adrenalin cortisol cocktail whooshing round my body (as it apparently has been for 50 years years) I'm frightened that I will lose control and won't be able to put on the 'I'm ok' front that has got me through the last 50 years! Or... From what I've read it may help control that uber anxiety but scared I won't get back to full time meaningful employment again... Just scared! Anyone have any thoughts or advice? Anyone been prescribed it to help deal with childhood trauma? If anyone is familiar with ACE scored I'm a ten so outlook may not be so good for me I don't know? Feeling terrified of the loss of control sensations! Thanks "

My injecting Dr told me I looked better than I did when he first saw me and I could manifest it into anything I wanted and that I had just had stuff in my face.

He thought it was irritated nerves maybe and give it time it might resolve. I waited a week and made an appointment with a aesthetician at another Plastic Surgeons office. She said she thought the same with nerves possibly and also said she could dissolve it if I couldn't wait it out. She also noticed I had blanching and Tindall effect that would resolve with hylase.

The pain waned over the next few hours but they remained very stiff. I was wondering what this pain could be? Would it be just because of the wrapping, or arthritis, etc? "
Pruritus,https://www.drugs.com/answers/causing-burning-itch-over-body-3430717.html,What’s causing my burning itch all over my body?,"It started about a week ago and came on strong. Wherever I itch, my scratches turn into red raised skin welts, nothing like I’ve ever had in my life. I’m 26, fit and a female. I don’t suspect anything in my bed as the mattress is only 4 months old, the sheets are only 3 months old, and my husband who sleeps in the same bed and lives in the same house has nothing. Nothing has changed with our detergent or shampoo. I did change to a new conditioner but after this happened I stopped immediately and a week later it’s still happening. The burning itch won’t go and I can’t sleep. I’ve been popping Benadryl like crazy as it seems to help a little. I finally went to the doctor and my liver and kidney functions are normal and I’m not pregnant. She prescribed prednisone so today was my first day with that. She said I would feel a little relief after the first day but I took 3 and felt nothing. Nothing has seemed to change here at home so I don’t know what kind of allergy it could be. We have lots of flowers outside but I’ve never had any reaction to them, especially nothing that’s so itchy burning as this. We’ve also had our cat for about 3 years, along with having cats in the past and never having an allergy to them or dogs. Any possible ideas I would greatly greatly appreciate! "

I turned, walked about 4-5 steps and the pain in my testicles and abdomen came back at about a 8 pain level. When I am setting down, I have almost no pain at all. When I start to stand up or I bent over and try to stand back upright the pain is a full 10. Very extreme. Then it subsides a little to about a 6-7 and it has stayed at a 6-7 for the past 1½ hours, maybe 2 hours. I have no idea what it could be or why it could have happened all of a sudden like that. A friend said hernia? But I haven't done anything to cause one. Please help me to figure out what it might be and if it is to the point that I need to go to the hospital. I despise hospitals and don't go unless it is a dire emergency. "
Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/blood-watery-diarrhea-look-plus-2802064.html,What does blood in watery diarrhea look like? (plus more)?,"Hi, about year or so ago I began getting slight pain in my upper abdomen (just behind the lower left hand side of my ribs. I could press into it and get extreme pain. I would get sharp stabbing pains and pain shooting down the bottom side of my ribs. It would be so painful it would wake me up sometimes. It comes and goes. I also have constant heartburn (it can be very mild, moderate or severe), I often have heartburn most days and pretty much all day. shortly after I had the pain in my abdomen I also got lower back pain.  Recently the pain has started up again (there's always pain if I press into it, that never left but stabbing pains and such have returned). However this time since the pain started up again  I've also been feeling very nauseous most of the time and my appetite has been less as of late..  One of the more recent symptoms however (started about 2 months ago, give or take), I've been having on and off bouts of diarrhea every now and then. When I finish and look down it's dark and you can't see the bottom of basin, sometimes there's a metallic odor to it. I assume it's blood but I am not sure as I have never seen blood in my waste before, let alone in watery diarrhea. Anyone have any idea what it would look like? Also, anyone have any ideas what may be wrong with me?  I would go to the doctors but the wait time for an appointment is very lengthy.  Thanks "

Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/terrible-pain-lower-dentures-put-over-stitches-2816629.html,Having terrible pain from Lower Dentures put in over stitches and bone grafts?,"I just had my remaining 6 teeth pulled four days ago, and bone grafts done, then had them stitched up. These were front teeth and one side molar. I had my uppers done 5 years ago at a wonderful one day clinic in south Carolina, this time I just had my local dentist do it. I had been wearing a lower bridge for many years so figured the only pain I would have would be where the teeth that were pulled and stitched would be. I was so wrong. That area isn't near as bad as the sides of the dentures, more toward the back, inside side was made too long, and was digging into the soft tissue surrounding your tongue, or where it connects. I did as the dentist said, kept them in for two solid days without removing until some of the swelling went down. Two days ago, I went in and told the dentist he had to do something to trim them down as I had a mouth full of sores, the getting them in and out was so painful I would stand at the sink tears streaming down my face for a half an hour just getting them in or out. He trimmed them, saw where the sore spots were and instructed me to take them out at night, soaking them, and do several warm salt water rinses. The only way I can get them back in is to spend an hour after awakening with ice packs on my mouth to reduce any swelling after sleep, dip the dentures in hot water, do a hot salt water rinse then gently insert them trying to not hit any sore spots. I can chew a bit, like the curds in cottage cheese, or the tapioca pudding but not anything else as it is still so very painful, again not in the front, but pressure on the molars makes them dip and hit the sore spots, and I nearly go thru the roof. I am on amoxil, and Norco for pain,1-2 every 6 hours, which is a problem because I've been on Norco for chronic back and shoulder arthritis for several years, so have built up a tolerance to it, and am allergic to any NSAIDS. The only way to make it thru the days is to take my anti anxiety pills in between the Norco to sleep. A relative told me to ask the dentist to give me Percocet instead of the Norco as it's stronger, but have never been on anything but Norco for pain. How long will it take for the sore spots to heal if I keep adding to them by wearing the dentures all day? Everyone was correct, bottoms are truly much harder pain wise than uppers were. I so want to just keep them out until all the sore spots heal, but am afraid that if I do that, the dentures won't fit at all if the swelling stays. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "

My dentist & cardiologist said no lidocaine ever again, cardiologist said if it happened gain, my heart may not be able to handle it, might go into cardiac arrest. I have tachy., brady., PSVT, PACs, PVCs, SVEs (all previously diagnosed on holter monitors, etc.) I also have another problem that was never caught on the monitors since it didn't do it when I had monitors on - My heart also goes into episodes of very intense ""quivering"" rather than beating, those only last a few seconds, but they are the scariest! I am on toprol xl daily, 25 mg reduced from 50 mg (on that for many years for arrhythmias & tachy., but recently reduced dosage because lately my blood pressure has been dropping very low and then going up high, back & forth daily). Heart problems run in both sides of my family.

They have heart monitor on during infusion, but I am scared to take the chance, my pain doctor scheduled it anyway to be done this Fri.

I have so many of the symptoms, in fact just now got done doing a test on the Shingles and on allergies I got almost 100% on the shingles, I have never even discussed with any doctors, nor thought about. But. The burning and small little blisters and face pain the whole bit, If I have been miss diagnosed Im fuming. I asked last month if my doctor thought I had something other then this fibro, as I get so exhausted that I nearly fall walking, I am listless at times during the day thinking I may be forming a type of sleep disorder. I literally fall asleep during a phone chat or even standing when Im in a flare. The nerve endings that hurt and the tears for the last three weeks have been so bad that I have had huge bad thoughts, and prayed(which Im now at 52) learning may be the ticket. I found another thing besides a pain noone has a reason for. This my friends may be something to think No one thinks this is recurring Shingles I mean, yet most suffers write the same as me for one damn week I feel good in sometimes two months, I am at least happy that there is or could be another alternative, I have suffered food given migraines that floored me since Birth , and until 7 to 8 years ago didnt even have a clue it was caused this way, pain my whole life and yet noone can tell me until oral surgery when top ramen became my diet, I was almost dead from MSG... So happyness until I can get a test. wish me luck as there is still hope that before my day comes Im to have a damn unpainful month except basic controlable arthritis... and that I can finally paly a whole day with all my grand kids, Gawd he must exist... as for the rest of my fellow pain sufferers please dont rule anything out because the doctor says, I am constantly looking as many of you. I heard my grandma had this when thinking hereditary??? My dads mom too had this every month when I was growing up I just never thought two times about it being the things wrong, good luck to us all, and I hope next week I have an update to this, I will find a doctor to test me for this if I have to go to ER to do it... many hugs to all.

I have been dealing with an addiction for about 8 years now. I was diagnosed with Chronic Daily Mixed Headaches. Due to the diagnosis I was prescribed Vicodin for 6 months. Well my doctor was like ""hmmm I am worried you may become a addicted, I am going to take you off."" Fantastic however i was already addicted. Well I began visiting the ER a LOT to get more pain meds, started buying them off of the street, and trying my hardest to just get a hold of any pain meds I could. 3 years ago my best friend brought me a little baggy of pills. There were 120 of these little boogers. I was oh heck yea thank goodness... something to help with my headaches for a long time.  And this starts my journey of those little devils called TRAMADOL!!! After she gave them to me I instantly did some research on them. ""never take more then 7, none addictive, non narcotic,"" blah blah blah! Thought PERFECT! Well I ran out of them and guess what MAJOR side effects started happening. I wanted to die and could not barely move. I rushed to the doctor and was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. My doctor sent me home with a script for TRAMADOL!!! I immediately got them filled. I have been taking them now daily for about 1.5 years. I have been taking anywhere between 8 to 16 a day. I even have 2 doctors prescribing them to me now. However yesterday I ran out. And no way of finding anymore. I decided that is it I am just not going to take them anymore. I want to live to see my boys grow up and meet my grandchildren.  I know that if I continue taking the amount that I am taking daily it is going to kill me. I have a heart disease and the last month I have noticed my heart palpating a lot more and severe chest pains. Also a significant drop in my breathing. So lil ol super woman here I thought I will just stop them and I will be fine. Woke up this morning, SEVERE muscle cramping, crazy twitching, feel completely out of my own head, and totally not me AT ALL!! I went ahead and came to work. I have been sitting here reading all of these posts about TRAMADOL WITHDRAWALS. Everything that these people are saying about withdrawals from Tramadol IS TRUE!!! There are a few on here saying that Trams does not cause withdrawals, if you took them as much as some of us and they did not cause you any withdrawals well great for you, HOWEVER 99.9% DO EXPERIENCE HORRIBLE WITHDRAWALS!! I just left work to go all the way across town to get 3 just to get me thru the rest of the day.  I guess I feel that I am just a loss cause.

It's more like restless lower body syndrome. I can't sit still in my chair. I feel like I have to keep moving around. And this never happens to me. About 3 hours ago I took 10 mg Flexeril. It minimized it for a short time, but it's back. What can I do, or take? I don't even know what's causing it? I'm starting to think it's coming from the Roxane Bupe I have to take. I'm not sure how many days it is since the Teva ran out. Maybe 4 or 5. This stuff is garbage. I almost think these are wds. But I've taken almost 12 mg in the past 6 hours.  What helps RLS? Other than Flexeril the only muscle relaxer I have is Baclofen. My Doc said I can't take Flexeril and Baclofen. Is that true? I don't really think he always knows what he's talking about.

I started on one a day for like a week and then 2 a day for the next two weeks and then up to 3 a day for the next couple weeks after that. Total time was about a month and a half to two months. And one day I only took one Norco instead of my usual 3 and I felt like I was dying. HUGE headache and nausea so unbearable. So I took a half of one and got to sleep and I got through it and the next day I was better. Then after being through that I definitely didn't want to go through it again so I know I had to taper but I realized that I only had very few to taper before I could get a refill. So I had to cut them in thirds and take a third a day for a week which was about only 3mg's. And it went well. No really withdrawal. Then I got my refill but didn't take any that whole day, I did take some Tramadol instead and later that night bad withdrawals again, the huge headache and nausea and throwing up constantly. So I had thought I had gone through the worst part and I wouldn't experience that again but obviously I was wrong. So I still went through that night of complete hell and I didn't take any Norco. So the next day which is today at night I took a full one and I am committed to only taking one if ABSOLUTELY necessary. But if I don't take anymore, by this time tomorrow night will I experience that hell again? So my main question is, does anyone know how long I'd have to stop for then to have me take one full one, one day and then a couple days later take another full one and will I have withdrawal symptoms? My main goal is to only take one if absolutely necessary. Which would be one or 2 days a week if that and if I did would I have withdrawal symptoms? Thank you for any responses, I need the help. "

My pain doctor clearerd it, stating that it would not effect Nucynta ER (my main relief) and it might effect Percocet, if anything at all and I might not notice. I noticed, and it was horrible. Percocet is just for breakthrough pain, and isn't as needed as Nucynta. But I felt like both were effected initially. However, I'm stumbling on a bizarre theory: is it possible for the naltrexone and Percocet to cause pain, more specifically, could those two interrupt Nucynta?

Just wondering if hydromorphone might also be increased by grapefruit? This would actually be a good thing to know if I had a particularly bad pain day. The way the laws have gone, there are ever more and more hoops to jump thru. I have never had so much as a traffic ticket and still feel like a criminal whenever the doctor's office hands me the cup to pee in. II know they are not picking on me, all patients have to do it every so often. I have nothing to hide, but it still makes me feel like a criminal. I have also read that birth control pills DECREASE the levels of pain meds, is this true? Any other advice, as far as getting the most pain relief would be appreciated. My theory is that it works best when taken on an empty stomach, preceded by nausea meds. I used to take Zofran for years, but suddenly had an episode of full anaphalaxis and they had to switch me to promethazine. Promethazine most often keeps me from actually throwing up, but does not totally relieve the nausea itself. My dose of pain meds is relatively low, and has not been increased in the 8 years I have taken it. In fact, I actually take less now, because I used to get many extra pills from my old doc in a different state. He knew I had anxiety about even getting to my appt (I can no longer drive due to medical issues) and therefore gave me a little padding in case of postponed appt, bad weather, etc etc Now, the dr only gives out the exact, exact amt til the next month. so there is no room for error or missing an appt.

I was prescribed 300 mg/day and illegally obtained enough to take 600 mg/day for at least the last year. I am getting more and more physical withdrawal symptoms between doses (nausea, pain, insomnia, fatigue, headaches, cold sweats, increased heart rate). I don't want to take more and am scared of addiction and death due to increasing amounts. Therefore, without a lot of discussion regarding above, I asked my Dr. to switch me to another medication. He prescribed 5/350 Norco. I stopped tramadol and started that about a week ago which didn't go well. The headaches were overwhelming. I then started taking the norco with about 1/2 the previous tramadol dose (300 mg/day) together. That is better but still the symptoms are persisting. My thought was to completely wean from the tramadol and switch to low dose Norco and then transition to some more natural solutions. Am I fooling myself? Everything I see says tramadol withdrawal is worse than vicodin which makes this plan logical from the perspective of getting through withdrawal on my own without relapse. The withdrawal feels much worse than the initial pain ever did which makes me wish I never would have decided taking pain meds was the easy road. Any suggestions would be much appreciated. "

I also get brain zaps and physical disorientation for about an 1 1/2 hours after I take it. Taking 1/2 in the morning and 1/2 at night.

I’m mainly pain free, although if I’ve gone to hard in the gym or whatever then that can cause my back to hurt more but I’m pretty good. I’d say that maybe 2/3 years ago I had a real problem with the oxycodone, finishing my prescription 2 days early and be making up some bullish*t excuse to the doctor for another script, i didn’t need to take loads more to get a slight feeling of euphoria, maybe an extra 10/15 mg spaced over the whole day, but I’d also find that sometimes you didn’t get that, instead you would get growly and irritable if you took too many and I didn’t like that feeling as I’m a really positive person. I think I just hated thinking about them so much, when is my next dose, researching them on the internet, trying to validate my doses etc ! I’m now on a pretty steady dose, I’ve been on same dose for over a year, I never run out in fact I left hospital with an extra prescription and just left them in the drawer, I wouldn’t have done that a year ago. I don’t really get any feelings of being high anymore, I don’t get that rush of euphoria (which was amazing!! I remember being like super woman at the start, was freaking awesome!) the dose I am does manage my pain, so yes I’m dependant, but I think I may have beaten the ‘addiction’ element I went through, I am too wary to take anymore (think I’ve maxed at 100mg once mixture of slow release and immediate release) as I’ve read about the respiratory problems and I don’t fancy that, and maybe I’ve just grown up a bit. It did take some dark moments when I felt I was in the grip of it, but I have never bought them, they have always been on a prescription, I’ve never had to lie or steal or anything because I constantly craved more, so I’ve maybe never experienced how low this drug takes some people ?

It's orange and shaped like a football. Recently I found a pharmacy that quoted a cheaper price so I switched. The pills I got are very small round and white. I've found an image of them on this site so I'm confident they are real. Plus the pharmacy is nationally known in the US and I trust them. The problem is that they just don't feel as potent as the ones I normally take so much so that I was taking two or three to get the equivalent of a single 8mg. pill. Needless to say, I ran out early and started to feel lousy after about two days. I don't understand what is going on. The pill has a vertical arrow on one side and an 8, I think on the other. I don't have much money and I have one renewal on this prescription.  I am going to try and see if the new pharmacy will switch to a larger pill but if they don't I will be ""stuck"" with the same tiny pills again. Over the years I have taken different generic buprenorphine pills and never had this happen. I don't understand what is going on. Has anyone ever run into this kind of problem? Maybe the size is lowering my absorption? I am also wondering if I can have my refill transferred back to my original pharmacy, if not I will have to contact my doctor and have him write me a new script but I don't know if that's legal while I still have an outstanding refill at the new pharmacy. My biggest concern is, as I stated above - I don't know why these tiny pills are so weak? I suspect that it is the size or lack thereof which may be inhibiting the sublingual absorption.  I would be most grateful if anyone can provide me with any information regarding this problem. "

That was a huge mistake one DR acted like we was going to take me then on the second appoint saw that I have a Psychiatrist and didn't take me but referred me to a DR. with ""more"" experience. This guy was working half days out of a house and with out really even getting my records or exam he did a drug test and then wanted to move me from hydrocodone to oxycontin. Instead of doing the daily narcotic twice as indicated in the rx info he gave me the entire dose once in the morning. I went through hell, felt like I might stop breathing then went through withdrawl at night. Called him several times and was told to just hold out till next appt. Just got back with old DR and am safely back on old med. I told him I wanted to try titration off the med to be sure I need it and bring down tolerance and we are both in agreement. I am going to reduce amount slowly by 1/2 pill every week.

He started out on just regular Percocet 5 mg, at the time they were the Dupont ones, that really workes, not like Percocet today, and slowly by slowly, it was Demoral, to Oxycontin 160mg 2x daily with some Vicodin as breakthrough, and that worked, but he was still in a lot of pain, but nowhere near as much as before he got the 160mg OC.All of a sudden his insurance got cut, and the Oxy 160 wasn't available in his plan, and it cost 859 $, Now This is a good man who works part time off the books, and collects Disability, He doesn't drink or gamble, he takes care of his family, and his job hardly pays out anything, he has 3 kids, so he is forced to go back living in the old excruciating pain he was in, taking Vicodin or Darvocet, basically anything he can get his hands on to give him some relief. He see's his Dr the Dr immediately can tell he's not bullshitting him, and gives him a shot of liquid Demorol or Morphine. And tells him since they don't really prescribe Demoral in the form of a pill anymore, he's gonna try him on Methadone, which my buddy quickly tries refusing because he thinks of Methadone as only a cure for junkies, which is not true, it's also a pain pill. So the DR writes him a pretty large script 40 mg 4x a day. There in the shape of Wafers, and they worked good for a long time, but he doesnt get the wafers anymore and since has gotten more surgery and is in even worse pain ,so they up the daily dose. But now he gets these horrific burps that literally smell like he is farting thru his mouth. This is not a joke. He is so ashamed and self conscience of this, that he carrys a little spray, because the smell is that bad. The Dr thinks that since all pain meds slow down your digestive system and clog you up, that gas is looking for anyway to escape ,and its not broken down yet to release gas so the body is pushing it out any way possible. He needs the medicine but can't stand the Burping and all the stomach medicine that comes with it. So if anything remotely similair has happened to anyone I would just like to know. Or if you know of another Medicine like Methadone that is cheap, but works the same, I'd appreciate it, and he would love you. lol I feel for the guy.Thank you very Much. "

Yea, I sound like a real mess, huh? Well I feel like one, too.

Since then I have felt especially angry with others and hopeless about my life. I want to get off some of these med.s but know I need to do it slowly and under a doctor's care. I've never taken so many different medications at the same time.  I'm signing off now. I don't know what to expect here but I do respond much better to others sharing their personal experiences than I do to advice.

I had a really bad response to Lexapro 3 years ago that 3 hours after taking it, I had the most severe attack of my life and ended up in the emergency room with sky high blood pressure, pulse and feeling of dread. The medical staff did all of the usual routine heart tests and ultimately diagnosed it as an anxiety reaction. I am terrified of the same thing happening with the Zoloft. My psychiatrist suggested taking it with a small dose of Ativan to counteract the initial negative effects. Is the adjustment period really that bad? I am terrified of it making me feel more anxious.

I can't pinpoint exactly when this started, but I truly believe that it is probably caused by taking Saphris, a sublingual medication that I take before bed for PTSD nightmares & auditory hallucinations between being asleep & not quite awake.

Also this burning tongue syndrome doesn't feel like the burning tongue I initially had with pernicious anemia.

I have also had rituxan infusions, an immune suppressant, for the past three years. How else can I lower my inflammation? Is there any type of anti immflamation medication that is not processed in the kidney or maybe not all of it is processed in the kidney. I am just thinking out loud looking for new suggestions. "
Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/nuvaring-bacterial-infection-safe-reuse-2835752.html,Took Nuvaring out because of bacterial infection... is it safe to reuse?,"I've been on the Nuvaring for about two years. As scheduled, I put a Nuvaring in about two months ago and then went to sleep. I woke up the next morning in terrible pain and could hardly pee. I took out the Nuvaring and went to my gyno where I found out I had a bacterial infection which was causing extreme discomfort. I put the Nuvaring that I had taken out back in the package and in the refrigerator. I had another Nuvaring, which I used last month after the bacterial infection was treated. So this morning, I went to go get the Nuvaring I had used for 7 hours and then couldn't decide if it was safe or effective to use. I have more on hand, but I hate to waste one since they are not cheap. Should I still use it or should I just toss it? "
