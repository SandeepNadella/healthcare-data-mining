I never suffered with anxiety or anything of the sort. However, last year (as in 2017) I was a fresher and it came with a load of changes I wasn't totally ready for (a bad break up, not being the best student - I was one of the best in High school, partying). In the end of 2018 I met a boy and we dated for 3 months, however, the relationship was being so stressful that in the last weeks of it i started crying on a daily basis and exhibiting symptoms of crippling anxiety and depression (he broke up with me when he found out i could be starting to fall into depression). I was put on Lexapro 10mg because the shrink thought i was at risk of being depressed. However, on day 1 of taking Lexapro me and my now ex stoped talking and I immediately felt better. Like, no stress, no crying, no difficulty sleeping whatsoever. This leads me to believe i was just in a bad relationship (or in a relationship before being ready for being in one) and I'm in no way depressed. Therefore, I do not need taking lexapro. I intend to visit a therapist regularly to help me address a few issues. However, i read enough about Lexapro and I do not believe I wish to keep taking it, as it does more harm than good in my situation.  I've been taking it for 10 days, can I just stop it, or do I need to ween out of it?  Ps: the first 4 days i took it, I took 5mg instead of 10mg (since that was what the doctor told me to do). "

Depression,https://www.drugs.com/answers/long-expect-lexapro-generic-form-work-3457689.html,How long can I expect it to take for Lexapro (generic form) to work?,"My doctor prescribed me the generic form of Lexapro exactly 5 weeks ago at 5mg dosage, taking it in the morning. After about 3 weeks of taking it and seeing my anxiety and depression get worse, I stopped taking it for a 2 days, mind you I was PMSing at this time when I felt like the meds were making everything worse. Then after determining I should give it a fair shot, I decided to keep taking it until I could positively say that it wasn't working for me. After being on it for a month, my doctor saw me again and decided to increase my dosage to 10mg since she believed the 5mg wasn't enough dosage for me. I've now been taking 10 mg for one week and I thought I was feeling better from it the first couple days, but I'm starting to find again that I am in my head a lot with my anxieties and fears. On top of knowing that I have anxiety, I was able to determine that I am dealing with Relationship OCD. So it's frustrating for me, that I am not able to relax and take things normally. I find myself in my head a lot and I am wanting to feel that relief from it that so many people have expressed. Basically what I want to know is, at what point can I truly determine that this medicine is not working for me, mind you it is the generic form. I know lots of people have said that it takes 6-8 weeks for them to really have the medicine completely in their system so I am trying to be patient with it. My boyfriend has been absolutely amazing with me and has been so patient and helpful. I want to be able to enjoy my first real relationship and not let my anxiety and fears get in the way of me doing that. Most of the reviews I've read on here say that they took 5mg for 1 or 2 weeks before upping their dosage to 10mg. I on the other hand, took 5mg for 1 month and even had 2 days straight where I didn't take it at all. I've just now increased my dosage to 10mg for the last week. Should I expect it to take longer for it to work on me, longer than 6-8 weeks, since most of the people who said it took that long, were taking it at 10mg much longer than I am? "

I did not use condoms at all in the process of switching and then the next month when I started my sugar pills I had only a little spotting. I was told it was normal to miss a period after switching birth control pills. However, on the third week of my second pack I seemed to get very heavy brown discharge that was almost a period that lasted around a week (I assume my last missed period) and then it stopped 3 days before my sugar pills on my next pack.

Because my period had finished right before I went to the doctor to get on the pill he said to start taking the active pills (brown pills in the pack) so I've taken yesterday's (Monday when I first went to the doctor) and today's which is Tuesday. So because I'm starting on the active pills I have 3 weeks on them then a week on the sugar pills is this right? Then when I'm on the sugar pills do I get my period? And when I get to the sugar pills (white ones) how long til I get my period after taking them? Or do I get it straight away? And if I still have my period but all the sugar pills in that pack are gone do I take the active pills in the next pack? And follow through? Or do I take the sugar pills until my period has finished? Because I usually get my period after 4 weeks is it normal to only take 3 weeks of the brown ones and then a week of the sugar pills? And is that when I get my period when I'm on the sugar pills? I hope this makes sense. And sorry for all the questions I'm just a little confused because I had to start on the brown pills not the sugar ones like usual. Please help my confusion :)

In December, I took a break from birth control just to see if it would help me lose weight. In January, I ended up having to take Plan B and then had to take it again 2 weeks later. Anyways, I started taking the Junel again that same month. About two months later, a new doctor prescribed me Gildess FE. I know they are the ""same"" but I've noticed some changes. For example, if I miss ONE pill, but take two the next day, I get my period very heavily for about 4 days. On Junel FE I could skip 2 days, double up my doses for the 2 days after that, and my period would go away almost immediately and was very light. Also, I have been breaking out noticeably more than before. I struggled with acne as a preteen and had to take Accutane so I do not wish to struggle with adult acne in my 20's. Anyways, I'm wondering if these changes are due to the change in birth control, or the fact that I took Plan B twice in January (and I had never taken it before in my life). I know this is a very complicated question but I didn't realize that there could be such differences in switching to a ""generic"" version of a pill. "

I am constantly caught between thinking about raising the milligrams of Paxil or getting off of it and try something else I’m just so damn scared that if I go off of it the horrible anxiety that I haven’t had to deal with in two decades will come back or that if I could try to go back on it it won’t work.

Anxiety,https://www.drugs.com/answers/anyone-lisinopril-raise-blood-pressure-lower-2958655.html,Has anyone ever had lisinopril raise blood pressure instead of lower it?,"Prior to starting, I normally had a BP of 126/78 with some variance when I took it at home. I get really anxious at the doctor though and my BP readings at the doctor tended to be 146/88. My doctor insisted I go on 5 mg of lisinopril. A week after starting Lisinopril, I checked my BP in the morning and it was 177/120. My first thought was that my home cuff must be lying to me as it needs replacement soon. However, I went to urgent care later in the day for an issue with my ears that my primary doctor couldn't see me for, and my BP was 168/110. The next day I checked my BP at a pharmacy machine about mid-day and it was 171/119.  I made an appointment to see my doctor that day. Her answer was to insinuate I was a liar about my BP readings at home, increase my dose, and send me to the ER. The ER doctors said everything looked fine, to just let the medication I was already on do it's work,and sent me home. I had not changed my diet, I had not changed my exercise routine, I was not taking anything pain pills, cold pills, etc., and I was not feeling any more anxious than I would any other day.  Is it possible for it to raise instead of lower BP? Is that something I should have my doctor look into?

I've been ""just going through the motions"" my entire life. I've sought and ""found help"" in the past, but that ""help"" was essentially an hour of pointless talk and a knew pill prescription once a month. The pills never really helped, I'm pretty sure when they started me on them they were more concerned with keeping me sedated because it sounded as if I'd intentionally hurt myself. At the time that was true. I couldn't see a point in anything, and didn't see a difference between life or death. Somewhere between 15 and 17 I think I found something psychologically that no one is really meant to find in themselves. It was as if I'd found some switch and simply turned it off. The pain, the constant sadness, the want to feel something at all just disappeared. My mind cleared to an almost completely blank slate, but I wasn't truly any happier. Now I really can't think back on how things were without completely breaking down. Sometimes I'll start crying even though I'm currently not feeling/thinking anything. And that switch is nowhere to be found. Right around 17 my parents decided, against the wishes of my doctors, to discontinue payment on medications. At the time I was taking 6 different pills once a day; but in a way they were right, the pills never really did help. I've been without any kind of medication since. I feel like there is so much I just don't understand about things that most people don't even think about, common things that are just part of life. I feel like I'm constantly ""under fire"" because I just can't be normal. It's like my brain is just wired differently; maybe I gave it a shoddy patch job, who knows. Concentrating on most things is nearly impossible for me; so much so that I haven't had a lot of luck holding jobs. At this point my health, both mentally and physically, is at a point where my wife would rather me not work at all. Realistically she's right. Asthma, Mild-Moderate Scoliosis, Internal bleeding in my legs because I was160lbs but couldn't focus on exercise any easier than I could focus on anything else.

Back Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/new-info-taking-calcium-alone-you-magnesium-new-570178.html,New info out about taking calcium alone. You must take it with magnesium says a new study!!?,"ORANGE, Calif., Sept. 14, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- The British Medical Journal recently published a large analysis based on the results of 5 clinical trials conducted in the U.S., Great Britain and New Zealand that involved more than 8,000 people. The analysis concluded that, ""Calcium supplements ... increase the risk of cardiovascular events, especially myocardial infarction (heart attack) ... A reassessment of the role of calcium supplements in osteoporosis management is warranted.""(1) According to Dr. Carolyn Dean, MD, ND, magnesium expert and Medical Director of the nonprofit Nutritional Magnesium Association ( ), approximately 30 to 40 years ago doctors began prescribing calcium on a routine basis to many men and almost all women over the age of 40 to counter the effects of bone loss due to aging. The conventional wisdom was that bone loss is due to calcium deficiency. ""After 40 years, it has become clear that taking calcium alone does not stop or even slow bone loss and does not prevent osteoporosis.""(2) The new wisdom now emerging is that magnesium is actually the key to the body's proper assimilation and use of calcium as well as vitamin D. Dr. Dean says, ""If we consume too much calcium without sufficient magnesium, the excess calcium is not utilized correctly and may actually become toxic, causing painful conditions such as some forms of arthritis, kidney stones, osteoporosis and calcification of the arteries leading to heart attack and cardiovascular disease. The effectiveness and benefits of calcium with respect to bone health and the prevention of osteoporosis are enormously impaired in the absence of adequate levels of magnesium in the body."" Many medical doctors, research scientists and nutritionists now believe magnesium supplementation is more important than calcium in order to maintain healthy bones as well as a healthy heart. ""Magnesium keeps calcium dissolved in the blood. Without the proper balance of magnesium to calcium, about a 2:1 ratio, calcium ends up depositing in kidneys and can create kidney stones, in coronary arteries where it can lead to clogged arteries, and in joint cartilage, rather than in bones where we need it most. The more calcium taken without the balancing effect of magnesium, the more symptoms of magnesium deficiency and calcium excess you are liable to experience,"" Dr. Dean says. New York Times best-selling author Dr. Joseph Mercola concurs, ""If you decide to supplement with magnesium it is important to understand that its complementary partner is calcium. So you should use both. Typically you would use twice as much elemental magnesium relative to the elemental calcium. That ratio works out quite well for most."" Dr. Guy Abraham, M.D., a research gynecologist and endocrinologist specializing in premenstrual syndrome and osteoporosis, has found strong evidence to suggest that women with osteoporosis have a deficiency of the hormone calcitonin that is only made when they take twice as much magnesium as calcium. In fact, he has found that when calcium intake is decreased, it is better utilized than when it is high. Dr. Abraham is one of many doctors and biochemists who advocate taking more magnesium to correct calcium-deficiency diseases.Dr. Dean adds, ""Adequate levels of magnesium in the body are essential for the absorption and metabolism not only of calcium but of Vitamin D, because magnesium converts Vitamin D into its active form so that it can help calcium absorption. Magnesium also stimulates a particular hormone, calcitonin, which helps to preserve bone structure and draws calcium out of the blood and soft tissues back into the bones, lowering the likelihood of osteoporosis, some forms of arthritis, heart attack and kidney stones.""

Back Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/21-years-5-bulging-discs-hope-783245.html,21 Years old and 5 bulging discs? Any hope for me?,"This is going to be a long one. JAN 2012 i went horse back riding - the horse slipped on ice and ended up crushing my entire left side. I ended up breaking my left leg. Healed fine. DEC 2012 I woke up one morning and i couldnt move, my bf had to move me around and even dress me. I went to emerg and was told i have a slipped disc. The point of not being able to move got better but im still in constant pain. I had to take medical leave from my job - i have to keep switching between standing and sitting or im in worse pain and my job was a desk job. I went to a back specialist who told me i just have a twisted pelvic bone and a joint out of place in my knee and ankle. I went to physio to see if i could get any relief from that, nothing! The therapist actually pulled my legs out of the sockets and i ended up in bed for 3 days. I decided i didnt want to keep paying to see people who just had 'opinions' so i requested an MRI ; T9 - T10 level the disc is desiccated with a mild diffuse disc bulge noted.  T11 - T12 level the disc is partially desiccated and narrowee with a mild diffuse disc bulge asymmetric to the left noted L3 - L4 level a slight diffuse disc bulge is noted. L4 - L5 level the disc is desiccated with a mild diffuse disc bulge noted. There is a small focal central component which indents the thecal sac L5 - S1 level the disc is desiccated and slightly narrowed. There is a mild to moderate diffuse disc bulge noted with a small broad based focal central component which indents the thecal sac.  Those were the results - my doc is on vaction so i still have to wait awhile to find out what it all means. Any ideas? Pain - I feel constant throbing pain in both legs and buttocks. It hurts when i sit for long or stand for long. Bending over hurts - walking ... seems like everything does. Im currently percribed tylonal 3s for the pain - i try to not take them but the pain is too much. Im 21 and i feel like theres no hope. This is leading me down a very dark road of depression.

It's been about 2 weeks now, at this point I think I may have something more, in conjunction with my cold/allergies. I'm considering taking antibiotics (a ""Zpack"" - Azithromycin 250 mg taken twice a day, then once a day until all the pills are gone). What are the potential side effects if I continue taking allergy meds with antibiotics [I'm aware that just taking antibiotics can be hard on the stomach - killing good bacteria that help with digestion]? 2) Upon one occasion of waking up at 2am with symptoms back, I've taken another 10 mgs of Cetirizine (Zrytec) - (twice the recommended dose for a 24 hr period - I took one before bed at 9pm)  What could be the side effects, besides the common ones of increased drowsiness, mental alertness, etc. (the only ones I've experienced thus far - not a problem for me when only taken at night only).  3) I've also taken it with two 25 mg Benadryls before bed and another when waking up with symptoms back in middle of the night. Additionally, every morning I'm taking a pill with 10mgs Loratadine (Claritin), USP & 240mg Pseudoephedrine, USP (slow release). On top of that, I take .25mgs of Colazepam (for anxiety/to help me fall asleep) before bed and when I wake up in the night.  I'm just trying to get some good sleep so my body can heal itself and I can get through the day - but I don't want to toxify my body with pharmaceuticals!! What have been other peoples experiences with increasing dosage and/or combining these drugs? What are the potential risks of these drug combinations - besides the common ones of reduced mental alertness, drowsiness, etc.? I've heard taking Cetirizine (Zrytec), even regular dosage, by itself, every night has a cumulative effect on the liver and other cumulative side effects. I've heard this about Ibuprofen as well (which I've occasionally used in conjunction too). I know Colazepam can be highly addictive (don't feel this is true for me personally - as I take the lowest possible dose, only when necessary).  I've had difficulty finding information about this and other potential side effects of long term, regular use of these allergy drugs. It's my thought/feeling that, as with all drugs, the long term effects may not be known - and that the cumulative effect of multiple drugs, regular use and high dosages will have some effect on the bodies organs, systems, normal operation, etc.  I'd appreciate any help - additional information and/or people's personal experiences. I really appreciate this site and the people that take the time to share their experiences & contribute to it! "

Anxiety,https://www.drugs.com/answers/neurontin-imodium-wds-withdrawal-opiates-hints-521447.html,"Neurontin and Imodium for wd's Withdrawal from opiates, Help Hints?","Just wondering if anyone else has had success with symptoms of withdrawals using larger doses of Gabapentin/nuerontin and large doses of Imodium. It has helped me considerably and I'd like to share my experience to help others cope with wds. I do not recommend this coarse of action to everyone. You'll have to know your own dose threshold of each drug, I'm just relaying my own experience and usage. First off: a little background, I'm in my 50's strong, healthy type with a hard working past. Also, a rather large drug and alcohol past that would stagger the imagination. I've wanted to be out of my skin on a daily basis since the age of 15. My physical strength kept me going where other less strong, or crafty people would have stopped using. I was a virtual garbage can of both legal and illegal drugs. When drugs were unavailable it was booze. After a lifetime of this and plenty of jail time and sicknesses I came out of it as a straight up opiate user, abuser. Any which one I could get, from Oxy's or perc's to Vicodins. For awhile I was on suboxone, but for reasons out of my control I couldn't get anymore, and finally finished up my run on good Ole vic's, about 150mgs or more a day. Recently the money ran out, (the economy) and I found myself in cold turkey status. I had neurontin and Imodium in the med chest and decided to take them in large doses, I'd seen some other threads where the poster claimed miracles using the two. I'm in day three of serious wds and YES, the combo of the two did ease the symptom's considerably. The dose is frightening, 10-15 2mgs pills of Imodium or store brand variants, (they all have the same ingredient: Loperamide) and 1800 mgs of Neurontin. Also, a good vitamin and fish oil caps seem to help with the sluggishness. At night a OTC sleep aid, or if lucky enough a Xanax or Klonopin, My gut is rumbling but it beats the pain and depression of withdrawal sickness. I have a ""slight high"" that seems to be at least helpful in that I'm not so irritable and jumpy. My question is: Has anyone else tried this? Any ideas on after effects, other than constipation or cross addiction of coarse. "

So I switched it at bedtime and I was still feeling drowsy and tired the next few days. I then stopped taking it because I hated how it was making me feel like a zombie. I went to see my psychiatrist again and he suggested Bupropion XL 150mg in the morning. I took it for one week but i had to stop it I was having bad/sad thoughts. I haven’t taken anything else for a week just the Sertraline and i still feel depressed but not i’m not having negative thoughts anymore. So I’m thinking maybe i should give Ability a try again. I have an appointment next month with my psychiatrist so I can’t talk to him for now. I would like to know if anyone has tried Sertraline with Abilify? Hope I hear from someone Thanks "

Anxiety,https://www.drugs.com/answers/feeling-horrible-numb-lexapro-3163258.html,Feeling horrible (numb) on Lexapro?,"Hello everybody. I've recently began my first semester of college and was doing great for a while. Going into college I was an extremely motivated, 4.0 / 33 ACT student who loved to learn. However, my college is a couple of hours from home and my relationship with my girlfriend has now gone ""long-distance"" as we are attending different schools. About half way through the semester, I began having panic attacks. This was strange because I've always had a little bit of anxiety but it never interfered with my daily life. After the first panic attack, I had multiple panic attacks daily for 3 consecutive days.The panic attacks involved not knowing where I was / familiar people and situations feeling unfamiliar to me. My doctor prescribed lexapro in order to stabilize me. The first week I took 5mg daily in the morning and have taken 10mg daily for the past 14 days (21 days total on the medicine). My anxiety has gone away but I have had headaches every waking moment of my life. I also find it hard to concentrate/remember simple things. I can have a conversation with somebody but not even be thinking about the conversation. I cannot focus on anything. I feel like a zombie/robot or as if my body is on autopilot while my brain is simply dormant. The Lexapro has taken my anxiety away but it has also taken away any other possible emotion I could feel. I am 19 years old, 6 foot 155 lbs. with a high metabolism. Since starting the medicine, I've been forcing myself to eat more (despite the decreased appetite) but have still lost 10 lbs. (I'm around 145 lbs. now). I used to stay up until midnight and wake up at 7 or 8 every day, but now I can rarely stay up later than 8pm. Many nights I sleep 12 hours and wake up still feeling tired. Recently I've begun to fall asleep by 8, wake up at 1 am and fall back asleep at three then reawaken at 7. I just do not feel like my normal self. I have no interest in anything and feel no motivation. I would rather deal with my anxiety and still feel all the other emotions (my life consisted mostly of joy) I used to feel. Now I feel as if the Lexapro has damaged my brain. I'm afraid that even when I wean off of the Lexapro I will never have my motivation/focus/feeling ever again. I feel completely ""numb"" (both emotionally and sometimes physically in my neck or arms) to everything and I hate it. I'm afraid I will fall out of love with my girlfriend because I cannot enjoy the time that I do get to spend with her. Has anybody else experienced this numbing feeling and will it go away after I am off the medicine? I have a month long winter break coming up at the end of the semester and want to use it to get off the medicine and feel back to my normal self, but I am afraid that the Lexapro has changed the way my brain works permanently.

Can this effect my health?,"I started birth control strictly to help with my periods (I’m not sexually active). My doctor prescribed me (28 day) Mononessa, but didn’t give me ANY instructions on how (what order) to take the pills. I did a bit of research and thought i had the general idea down, but I still managed to screw everything up. First of all, I was not aware of the very specific Sunday you are supposed to start the pills on, so I’m 90% sure i started them on the wrong day. My next mistake was that while i was taking the outer pills i started my period (around the 7th of the month). So, i thought that when you start your period naturally, that’s when you start the placebo/sugar pills in the middle. Me, being an idiot, started the middle pills without finishing the outer pills. When i was done taking the middle pills, i went on to finish the outer pills in the pack until the month was over. i received real instructions when i went on to my second pack and got some real instructions, I panicked a bit at the realization of me taking the first pack completely wrong. Anyway, i started the second pack intending to use it correctly the second time through. As i was taking the outer pills, I got my period (the same time i usually do- around the 7th). So i had a normal 7-8 day period while on the medicated pills. About a week after that period stopped, i completed the outer pills, began taking the placebos, and i got a SECOND PERIOD. Twice as painful and awful as the first. I’m honestly concerned for my health with all the screw-ups I’ve made with these pills. So I’m currently on my second period and not doing well. Anyway! I know I’m an idiot. but If someone can help a sister out it would be greatly appreciated. If this was confusing to you and you would like to help, i am more than happy to answer your questions.

Then the week I got back, I started getting a runny nose and had body aches, then the next week, one night I was laying in bed and all the sudden started having trouble breathing and it hurt to take a deep breath, I started to have a panic attack and almost called an ambulance but my boyfriend was able to calm me down. The next day I decided to smoke a cigarette, only to find that it made my lungs worse. Over the next few days whenever I would start to feel a little better I would have a cigarette or a few, even though I knew I shouldnt have and I really wish I didnt. I started getting worse body aches, head aches, a slight fever, REALLY runny nose and cough. I then saw the doctor who prescribed amoxicillin, which would temporarily and almost never help my breathing and would dislodge a lot of mucus I had in my sinuses or my lungs, but not a lot came from my lungs. It was then about 7 days in to the antibiotic and wasnt feeling much better, so I went to go see her again , she then prescribed azithromycin, or the z-pack , and said she didnt hear anything in my lungs, but said that the z-pack would help clear things up. Im still having A LOT of post nasal drip. I didnt take the z-pack for a couple days because I read up on its side effects, but I finally caved in last night and took the first 500mg dose, thankfully with no side effects YET, Im still having lots of trouble breathing, my lungs hurt, mostly at the bottom, and Im scared my lungs might be like this forever, which Im sure they wont because at times of taking the amoxicillin my lungs opened up and almost felt like they were back to normal. I am also an 18 yr old female and have only been smoking for a couple years. Im so mad, I was totally fine before California, and now I can barely do anything because my lungs are so bad and I get tired so easily. "

Anxiety,https://www.drugs.com/answers/plan-causing-late-period-3490259.html,Is Plan B causing my late period?,"I'm quite anxiety ridden over this, so thought getting some input might ease my mind. On March 6th, an incident occurred, and so I took Plan B the following day. My period is normally regular, starting on the 23rd or 24th of every month. Well, I had what felt like my normal excruciating menstrual cramps on the 23rd, but I still have yet to bleed. I've taken two first response pregnancy tests in the last couple days and both came back negative to my relief. I've been experiencing breast tenderness and some cramping the past few days. What I also found interesting was that a day or two before I should have received my period, I had discharge that appeared to be the kind you get when you're ovulating (clear and stretchy like raw egg whites). So I'm wondering if the Plan B delayed my ovulation and therefore, has delayed my period? I can't think of any other explanation. I just had blood work done, and they didn't find anything significant. What I find most disconcerting, however, is that in the past couple of days, I have started experiencing waves of fatigue and dizziness that come and go throughout the day, which is the primary reason I went to my health clinic. I also have quite a bit of breast sensitivity as well. The waves of dizziness are quite anxiety inducing and disorienting. I have read multiple posts of other women having similar experiences with plan b and getting their period up to two weeks late. Might these be persisting pre-menstrual symptoms because I ovulated late and have not gotten my period? Looking for some sensible input. Thanks guys! "

Back Pain,https://www.drugs.com/answers/lower-back-injury-heal-speed-process-2871886.html,When will my lower back injury heal and what can I do to speed up the process?,"About 4 months ago I pulled a muscle (I think) in my lower back while carrying water bottles. I didn't actually hurt myself until I put them down, the plastic was cutting into my fingers and I dropped the package without it being fully on the ground, and instantly my back started hurting intensly.   I've pulled a muscle in my arm before, which I just left alone and in about two weeks it healed. I thought the same thing would happen with this injury. I'm still in school and during gym I found that most of the stretches were unbearable, so I didn't stretch all the way, just going far enough so I didn't fall over and die on the floor. While running every time my feet hit the floor I would feel pain in my lower back.   It seems almost like it's getting worse now that school's out. After laying down or sitting down on the floor getting up has been painful. Getting off the couch or out of a chair hurts, and even washing my hands has become awkward.  Applying pressure to the injury doesn't increase the pain, only bending. The pain has always been exclusively in my lower back, and hasn't spread at any point. I'm a girl, and I'll admit I'm not very active. I haven't seen a professional about this yet, but if it doesn't resolve soon I'm going to have to. I'm really hoping to be back to normal before the school year starts up again in the fall. Thanks. "

Its been about two weeks since I got implanon and I have not had any spotting of any sort... nothing.. nada. I've had natural unprotected sex twice (after the 7 days) and have not received spotting or a period. Before I got implanon I was on Yaz since I was 14 (am 19 now) and didn't realize how bad it affected me hormonally until I stopped taking it under a month before my implant was inserted. It numbed my vagina, dried it out, and gave me severe anxiety which all went away once I stopped Yaz. I never had life without yaz really so I didn't know...  I'm also so used to having a period that comes at the same time every month so I counted on my calendar to see approximately when I should get my next period (if it were to be regular per say) and its estimated to be scheduled for today, the 3rd. I have had absolutely no spotting at all during these two weeks and was wondering if that is a good predictor of my future spotting? Also no side effects... I have two friends that got implanon and it basically affected them immediately bleeding-wise and I have nothing at all. I cannot figure out if I'm having PMS or not.

Anxiety,https://www.drugs.com/answers/duloxetine-cymbalta-after-3-months-after-3440466.html,Should I come off duloxetine/Cymbalta after 3 months after continued side effects? I am in the UK.,"My doctor knows nothing about anti-depressants, the mental health service have refused help, and I cannot afford private help. I am trying to work this out myself, which is far from ideal, but I don't have a choice.  I was on citalopram for 13 years (10 of which unnecessary as I had recovered), but had relapse after stopping abruptly on doctors advice. It's now been a year and I was put on duloxetine 12 weeks ago. I was OK for about 4 weeks, but then I started getting dizzy, fatigue, confusion and agitation. This happened at week 5, 7, 10 and again in week 12. I have also had diarrhea every morning for 3 weeks. I know these are all common side effects. 10 days ago I was tired of chronic diarrhea, so reduced dose from 60mg to 30mg. Yesterday it all kicked in again. Could hardly get out of bed - still in bed now and been suicidal. The only thing that has triggered my anxiety and depression since taking the duloxetine has been these spells of side effects. They last 2-3 days, then I suffer anxiety or depression (or both) for a further 3-4 days. Today has by far been the worst - quite likely due to the withdrawal catching up, but should I go back to 60mg and reduce slower, or stick with it? I just don't know, and I have no-one to help. Please... anyone... some help. I would be so grateful. I should also add that I have been tapering Citalopram, but still on it as I don't know what is causing the side effects. Below is what I have covered thus far; Week 1 20mg Cit / 30mg Dulox Weeks 2-3 10mg / 60mg Weeks 4-5 5mg / 60mg Weeks 6-11 10mg / 60mg Weeks 12 10mg / 30mg Thank you all so much "

I have been diagnosed with both and am having a hard time deciding, understanding, which to receive the most aggressive treatment for... I had a uterine laproscopy several years ago to determine the severity of the endometriosis and it was determined to be a ""moderate"" case according to my obgyn. I was also told I had PCOS based on my blood tests & pelvic/transvaginal ultrasound. I have had the most horrific menstrual pain & all the pmd symptoms & illness associated with hormone imbalance since I first started menstruation. I had irregular periods & when I did menstruate I had extremely heavy bleeding & a pain that made me WANT to die because nothing I did seemed to result in any relief. Anyway I have been taking birth control for probably 15 years on & off and I am currently off. My endocrinologist says it is necessary to treat the PCOS, that I need to have a period at least every 4 mos to reduce the risk of cancer, she prescribed Metformin, & suggested I see my obgyn to discuss birth control because she would recommend it for the PCOS, but said the endometriosis has to be closely monitored by the obgyn & that it often feeds off of the hormones produced by the birth control pills. So my question is: Which should I be most concerned about? The endometriosis or the pcos? Mainly in the event that one could lead to cancer. I am 30 and have no children & with the multiple health issues I have don't plan on it. I would like to hear from women who have one or both of the ailments I mentioned & what their experience is/was, their knowledge about it, and any advice they might like to offer. Thank you!!! "

My husband passed away very suddenly 6 years ago & I have not been interested in going out, dating or anything. I am middle aged, & this man is 10 years older than me. He came on strong while I was moving in, I was exhausted, looked a mess, & really did not want him seeing my personal things or pushing me to get things done right now. It was late & I needed sleep. I have PTSD, which causes me to have a lot of anxiety. I take Xanax, which works very well for me & I do not abuse it. Every day, this man came over, & wanted to help. He was too pushy, & I told him thank you, but I just needed some time right then. As time went by, we discovered we had an amazing amount of things in common. We began doing things together, & he just came out & said I had no conception of time, was spending too much time on one thing, caused him to miss his favorite lunch, etc. I told him to do what he wanted, & we could catch each other later. No. He wanted to be with me, but I came to find it was on his terms. He would ask me if I was dumb, on drugs, sleep deprived, or what, that made me so slow. Ok, I am not that slow & I said so. I have the right to take my time to look at something before I buy it or dig it up (we both are rock hounds) or whatever. He is a very generous & kind person, & is always giving me things. I lend him a hand with things he cannot do, & we have become good friends. But always, there was a strange feeling when I was with him. He shamed me in front of whole rooms full of people, telling me I had 20 minutes & no more. I would be browsing & he would come up behind me or get in front of my face & say I was wasting his day, what was wrong with me, was I just stupid, slow or what? He told me I spent too long taking personal care of myself (a bath) & generally, wanted to control my life. He has stormed away from me numerous times, & avoided me for months, which is very embarresing, as everyone knows about us in our small living complex. Suddenly, he would come back, never say he was sorry, & expected me to pick right back up where we left off. I tried to talk to him, but it did not good. He tells me if I don't take his advice, not to bother him about whatever it is, anymore. I don't ask for his advice, it is just general talk, & he tells me his problems, & I listen, but never do I say unkind things or give him ultimatiums. I am not used to the lay out of this town, & find it very confusing. I have asked him if he would show me where a place is, & since he is from here, he gives me directions I do not understand, & he gets really angry. I drive too slow; I have no sense of directions; there is something seriously wrong with me; what is wrong with me that I cannot follow his simple directions? These are just a few of his constant batterings. It is confusing. I have never been treated like this before. He is very hard of hearing, I speak softly, & this enrages him. He will point with two fingers to his eyes & say ""Look at me""!! Listen to what I am saying! This is very insulting & degrading. I am by no means dumb, but I missed the signs that he is a controller. He is a Bully too. If you met him, you would never see it, unless you let him into your life & really got to know him. He has told store employees they are not doing their jobs right & tell them what to do. Same thing at restaurants. I love to grow flowers and am good at it. He enjoys it too. I had quite a nice bunch of hanging baskets last summer, & shower them gently every day, sometimes twice if it is hot, in the AM & PM. I had to have surgery, & he said he would care for my plants. When I came back home, most of them were either dead or close to it. He said I was wrong, that you only water them 3 times a week tops. I know better than this, he could see that I was shocked by the condition of my lovely flowers, & I clearly told him I knew how to garden & would hire someone next time I needed help. Another round of insults. Finally, this last week, he was very moody, & I didn't go to see him as often. We both are Diabetic, he does not take care of himself, but I do, & he put candy all over the coffee table, right in front of me. That's a tough one! He is very much in control of the television (both of them) & constantly is switching back & forth between programs until I don't have any idea as to what we were watching. He has a system that he knows well, to get past the commercials, & handed me the remote & said he was going to read, & to take over. I am unsure as to how to work everything, but it is easy for him. He has explained it, but I do not understand it all yet. I asked a simple question because I could not mute the sound, & he blew his top. If I was that stupid, then go home! He had showed me many times, yet what didn't I understand?? What is wrong with me, stupid, dumb, brain damaged, on drugs, you name it. I quietly gathered my things & came home. He sat & pouted like a child. He even berates me for wanting a hug, saying I am too affectionate! For just a hug?? I have been very isolated since I lost my husband, but finally let someone into my life & he turns out to be a control freak & a bully. It is confusing, because he is so kind & generous, but it comes with a big price. I don't even want to get out of bed. I have come to care for him, but there is no future with him. It's back to the same thing. Totally ignoring me, so I gave notice & am moving away. He once said he would not tolerate me being jealous, which I am not, and I will no longer tolerate his controlling & bullying. He has really pulled me down. I didn't see it at first, but I sure know it now. I don't want to be enemies, but I can no longer take him. Yes, I will miss his kindness, but not the painful strings that are attached. My self esteem has hit rock bottom, & this is not good for me. I cry all the time, try not to go outside so I don't run into him, & feel awful. I just want to sleep. How do I get away from this? He has never hit me or he would be in jail. It's the degrading verbal & emotional abuse. Why does he do this? How do I get my self worth back & put this behind me? I am sorry this is so long, but it's the only way I can explain. I have friends here, feel safe, & this may not be the right place for me to be for this problem. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you "

I have noticed lately that I am just ""blah"". I have no motivation and am emotionless. I have no interest in doing the things I used to love to do and definitely no interest in doing things that I should do (chores, groom, dress nicely). I hate to say it, but I really don't care how I look or how my house looks. I want to care; I just can't. The things I used to love to do don't even occur to me anymore - like tending my garden or making weekend plans. At some point, I will just think, ""Wow, I haven't been out in the garden in weeks."" Then the thought is gone and I move on to something else. It can be days before I say ""I never got out to the garden""! I either think about tasks (like the garden) or start them. but never finish them. The weekend can come and we have no plans because I gave it no thought. I am content to just do nothing. I have goals, but they don't ever get off the ground. My thoughts wander somewhere else. I just have no focus. Anyway, my psychiatrist thinks that the Lexapro may be the culprit . He said that sometimes if a person is on it too long, it can have the reverse effect of what we want it to do. He is transitioning me to Cymbalta: I started 30 mg today and increase to 60 in 7 days, while tapering off of the Lexapro at the same time. He believes it will give me some get-up-and-go motivation and help with focus. Any thoughts?

Bipolar Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/abilify-make-feel-good-adderall-566809.html,Will abilify make me feel as good as adderall does?,"For the past five years I have been on adderall and lexapro, however, I have only taken my adderalll because I can't stand the side effects that pair with the lexapro. After many episodes of feeling up and down I finally was honest with my doctor and told her her that I love the adderall and have not taken the lexapro, but am tired of feeling really up or really down. She diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and switched my meds to only abilify, once a day. Since I have been taking adderall for so long I have become partially dependent on it. I'm wondering if abilify will have the same effect, as far as helping me focus and accomplish what i need to get done with energy. However, I also want my mood to be stable, and not so much of a roller coaster. Any feedback on how abilify works or makes you feel would be great, thanks! "

Bipolar Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/lamictal-advice-guidance-increasing-dosage-913307.html,Lamictal Advice really need some guidance on increasing dosage in a depressive state?,I have cyclothymia and until about 4 months ago I would normally experience between 1-2 depressive states every 5-6 weeks. the depressive states typically lasted 3-5 days. i started out taking lamictal 4 months ago and i couldnt believe how good the improvement has been; for 3 months i had only slight mood swings but i experienced neither a hypomanic or depressive period that brought my life to a standstill. even though tmood swings were there they seemed less signiifcant and i was still able to function properly. As per my psychiatrists' advice since i started taking the meds i slowly worked up the mg but have been on 100 mg a day for the last 2 months and that seemed to be working perfectly. Over the last 6 weeks or so I have been experiencing small bouts of depression and hypomania and about 3 days ago entered a very very debilitating depressive state that i think thankfully is starting to fade. I took 150mg this morning (which i have never done before) and i now feel better - this mightnt be a result of the increase it could be that the depressive state just ended anyway or it could be a combination of the two. Am i becoming immune to Lamictal? - Because i haven't been increasing my dosage over the last 2 months (have been on 100mg for roughly 2 months now without an increase) is that contributing to the recent mood swings? Do i need to increase the dosage? I have found that taking the whole dose in the morning helps me sleep better at night so i always take my dosage in the morning? is this right? The last advice from my psychiatrist was to take 100mg a day. However when i feel like im in a depressive state should i try upping the dosage to 150mg - 200mg a day and then when the depression fades just go back to 100mg? as you can tell i am for some guidance; i really want to get the best out of my life and will try desperate anything to manage my condition. Any guidance big or small will be much appreciated...

Anxiety,https://www.drugs.com/answers/long-anti-depressants-providing-full-relief-1029820.html,How long anti-depressants take in providing full relief?,"Dear sir/madam, My name is Simon. I stay In INDIA. Since the age of nineteen, I have been suffering from Social anxiety disorder. Now, I am 27. Currently, I am taking psychiatric treatment for the same. I have a doubt. Please clarify. It will be a great help for me. I have done some online research before going for the treatment with anti-depressants. Based on my research I read on many websites that anti-depressants, particularly SSRI takes around 6-8 weeks to reach the full therapeutic effect. BY this I got the following impression that: In order to free from whole social anxiety symptoms (as if one is feeling completely normal, although one has to continue taking medicines even after full symptom relief) it will take around 6-8 weeks. In my case, my social anxiety is finely helped by these medicines. But I did not get the full relief even after 3 months of treatment. I mean my eye contact is still not so good with other peoples. Also, I feel some anxiety while taking to others. Could you tell me what should be done now. Should I request my psychiatrist to increase dose or to go for a medicine change? I was given these medicines till now, First two months--- nexito 10mg and klonaz 0.25mg Third month--- depran-H(it contains escitalopram 10mg and clonazepam ip 0.25mg) and Oxyma capsules(omega fatty 3 capsules).

At 18 my parents decided to get a divorce, one I was put in the middle of and it was a nasty one where my parents divulged dark secrets I knew neither had, on top of that I was dealing with an unfaithful boyfriend. I started crying out of no where and frequently so I took myself to my general practitioner who immediately brought me to the therapist. After describing that I dont really remember my childhood just certain traumatic events ( the year 2000 we had family deaths back to back months apart, I was 12) the therapist told me I was bipolar one and had severe depression. She prescribed me Lamictal. Fuzzy now but I think the dose was 15mg. Really low. But after I started to take it I was stripped of all emotion. All I did was sleep and go to work. I found no interest in activities anymore and didnt find things funny that I used to. My parents called me a zombie. I began to have panic attacks and lost my appetite. My therapist told me to cut the pills in half and it still didnt work so we decided I should stop taking it all together since it was such a low dose. Never went back... but ever since stopping the lamictal certain side effects listed for this med have stuck with me and I am now 30. I barely eat. Never feel hungry. I have panic attacks, have a lot of anxiety, im always cold (but not anemic), my menstrual cycle changed and never regulated. The list goes on. I am just wondering if it is possible for these side effects to effect you life-long causing the need for different meds.

Higher doses making you insane with grief?,"... officially diagnosed with bp2. I did the usual titration of 25mg for two weeks, 50mg for two, then up to 75mg. At 25mg I noticed a difference pretty immediately but assumed it was a placebo effect from finally getting the right help. At 50mg I felt even better but had an incredibly scary manic episode one night after only a few drinks; disembodied laughing, panic attacks, cold harsh words, grief, all in minute long cycles. I chalked this up to the fact that I clearly cannot drink a drop on these medicines. But then the nightmares started. Anxiety has always been very debilitating for me, and I was having vivid anxious scenario type dreams every night that lasted throughout my days. I then went up to 75mg and a few days later what had happened to me that one night at 50mg started and lasted for five days straight. The grief was immense. It was like a barrier had been unlocked after years, but it wasn't just that; memories came back, which would have been something to work through, if not for the ten minute cycling from this to rage to suicidal threats to disembodied laughing to weird philosophical rants. I immediately lowered myself (safely) back down to 25mg and was planning to go off entirely, but I've stayed there for almost a month now. It seems to be turning my life around. I feel like I had somewhat of a breakthrough that would have taken years of therapy to reach during that week of absolute hell, but could not stay doing that. So I guess my questions are: 1) Does anyone find 25mg helpful? Or am I just riding a breakthrough wave and will crash again? 2) Was this week of hell showing me that the dose was working or too high? Should I have tried to stick it out? (I almost called 911 multiple times so probably not.) 3) Has anyone else experienced this effect? The unpacking of grief? Could it have been more my feelings and memories coming back than it was a manic reaction to the medication? 4) Has anyone had a bad reaction going up, went down for a bit, and then tried again?

Anxiety and Stress,https://www.drugs.com/answers/medication-relax-mentally-muscles-3492814.html,Is there any medication to help me relax both mentally and my muscles?,"Hello. I have a very bad right leg/knee, its stiff and weak. I was born with bad knee... (I think its called Luxating Patella... its when the kneecap slips out of its normal position). My knee has gotten a LOT worser now, it has been in a terrible condition for 1 year... its so bad that it became very discomfortable / scary for me to sit/stand up from chair etc, because I have hurt my knee so many times from simply sitting / standing up. .so now I always feel stressed/scared/anxious if I try to sit, I tense up (including my bad knee/leg... i guess my muscles... I tense up without doing it on purpose.) The fear I feel is too strong so mostly I can't sit at all, and when I can sit its only for a few seconds. On the mornings I feel slightly more relaxed/not as stressed; but later on ,during the day /afternoon/evening/night I feel worse. My question is, is there any medication that help me feel less anxious because of my knee ? and something that helps me relax(both mentally and body/muscles?) something that makes my body not as tensed... muscle relaxing I guess? So that its not as scary for me to sit/stand up. Thank you beforehand :) "

I have read lots online about people on Lamictal and various other meds (psychotropics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers etc) and tell me they've experience hypomania however I need to be sure it's just the Lamictal.  I started on 25mg Lamictal and increased to 50mg with another increase to 100mg in about 3-4 days.

I have what is looking (and presenting) a lot more like Borderline Personality Disorder however my Dr. wanted me to try Lamictal before ruling out Bipolar.  Current symptoms of hypomania started about 2days after increasing to 50mg Lamictal. Symptoms include  -risky behaviors (sexual and non sexual) including: sexual activity with multiple people, excessive spending of money, driving my car recklessly at fast speeds  -little to no sleep: when I do fall asleep I sleep for about 4-6 hours (compared to my normal 8-10 needed to function prior to meds) and then I'm up and ready for the day. Don't feel tired at all the next day  -excessive amount of energy  -racing thoughts  These are all abnormal things that I never engaged or had prior to the bump to 50mg Lamictal.  I'm wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar and if so how long until it goes away? Will it turn to Mania? lookibg for answers before I inform my psychiatrist about the symptoms and ask to go into a BPD med or if symptoms eventually go away and I can keep quiet about them and keep the Lamictal.

Then I spent a few years travelling the world, writing a book, going back and forth from being on top of the world to not being able to get out of bed. I am now 26 and after many life-long mental, physical and emotional scars from my mania, which have added PTSD to my list of problems, I have finally begun the process of accepting my disease and that i will have to take medication every day in order to hold a job, repair my relationships, and maintain any healthy relationships or activities. My depressions were getting too long and too hard on my partner and my highs were getting too high and dangerous and also very hard on my partner, family, and general well being. Kaiser put me on 1.5mg of Ativan for 14 months and offered no therapy, just an addiction. When I finally decided to get better help I started weekly therapy and was put on 200mg of Lamictal a day and can take 2-4mg of Xanax as needed (for the PTSD, depressions, paranoia, flashbacks, etc), also I take Saphris at night to help with the sleep. The Saphris has been extremely helpful in allowing me to get a good nights rest, which allows me to function the next day. The slow ascension of the Lamictal allowed me to not feel the bad side effects as much as I built up to the full dose.  Yesterday Doc started me on Lithium 400mg. On top of the Lamictal 200mg, Xanax 2-4mg, and Saphris. I took it last night and I now feel a little... well, dumb. Literally. I am having problems connecting sentences in my head and my stomach hurts. I woke up extremely sluggish and have never been a coffee drinker... I am now. I am also a writer, and am terrified that my stories, the ones I write and the stories of my life will be duller, more boring, more ""traditional,"" more of all the things I didn't want my life to be. But I don't want to put my family or myself through anymore than I already have, and I have decided on continuing the medications. I am terrified that I will lose ""myself,"" not be as funny or creative as I once was, not be the life of the party ever again, never be able to feel like I was on top of the world again... the highs of mania are extremely, extremely, seductive.  I am also very considered about the stigma surrounding Lithium, not just what people (and I) assume about it, but also the long long list of side effects that come with. Also, as an avid traveller, I am afraid of losing or having the medications stolen and then being with out them, especially if I am out of the country. I am just... afraid. And still accepting this life-long disease, and the long list of medications that come with it, and the side effects. It is obviously a very, very steep mountain to climb, and I am afraid. "

A Dr. told me that when my tongue ""gets fat"" and I have difficulty speaking (effort-wise) and I sound blotto - that is EPS. On the downside - if it is EPS, my throat could swell shut. Since then I have regularly been taking Inderal and Benedryl. Well, I have been getting it a lot these days, despite the drugs. My anti-psychotic is Geodon 160mg/day. So, I was wondering if anyone gets this symptom and what their Dr. told them about it. I do have some Tardive Dyskinesia, which, I guess is somehow related (I rock slightly, side-to-side, when standing, and inside my mouth, I twirl my tongue).

Anxiety,https://www.drugs.com/answers/scared-death-anxiety-lift-1048561.html,I'm scared to death. Anxiety won't lift?,"I'm turning to all you wonderful people for advice . Here is my story as brief as possible so I don't bore you, but hoping details might be of something you have heard of: 1 year ago I was put on Remeron 15mg for sleep and to get me off Ativan. The reason I was on Ativan and for 3 years straight of .5mg a night for sleep, was simply because it made me sleep. Started getting interdose w/d so they said take more Ativan. As I did, it started not working correctly. Made me worse. fast forward a year and 1/2 I gained 40lbs from remeron and never really felt right on it. Just didn't feel like myself. My psychiatrist who put me on it started a slow tapering using a compound pharmacy. Got down to 5mg capsules feeling just fine. Introduced a liquid suspension at that time for slower tapering. Took one 5mg dose of the liquid and immediately got agitated, anxious, and mean. did not sleep at all. next night went back to 5mg capsules and for 3 nights got worse and worse. no sleep and just feeling sick and weird. My GP thought I developed a paradoxical reaction so pulled me off and had me take melatonin . I felt great for a week. Then severe anxiety and shaking, jerking, itching started. The GP insisted I take an Ativan. I did. for a week at the dose of 1-2 mg per day. It made me worse again. Saw the psychiatrist. He thought it resembled withdrawal. Took 6mg of Remeron after 3 weeks of being off and felt immediate relief. It WAS withdrawal, but now I'm also having classic Ativan w/d. My plan now is 7.5mg of remeron, with quicker taper off the Ativan. Did that last night and woke up in the middle of the night every night with severe anxiety rushing through my body. I can tell remeron is not doing what it usually does because i'm not hungry. and remeron always makes me hungry! It seems like that liquid suspension really messed up my brain chemistry. I'm not getting better and I'm scared to death. They don't even want to try me on another med because they thnk my reaction will be worse. I have a child I cant take care of now because i'm a mess. I saw a neurologist who did a brain scan back when this all started and I have some abnormality in my watershed areas. apparently its a vague reading, but means something. I keep rejecting medicines I wouldn't normally reject. even advil.  in the last 3 weeks ive been to the ER twice and seen many doctors. I live in Los Angeles where there are many of the bests physicians and facilities, but no one can help me. If I go to a psychiatric hospital, all my docs say the docs in there will pup me full of meds I don't want and make matters worse. I don't need to be sedated, just helped. A detox? but what am I detoxing from? remeron? the reason i'm so scared is because I cant imagine living my life everyday in fear and panic. no benzos help, only hurt. I have a supportive family, but they cant fix me. It scares me that I actually start thinking it would be better not to be alive. Is that my choice? live like this or take my life? Honestly, I'm a grounded 48 year old woman who has never taken any hard drugs, never been a drinker, just sort of regular and I suppose hum drum. But where do I go for help??? no one will help me get stable. "

I have been on geodon 20mg twice a day for a year now and my psychiatrist has told me to stop with geodon and start seroquil 25mg at bedtime due to nightmares.

Will these symptoms get better in time or should I leave seroquil alone? I want to quit the geodon because I have been on it for so long.

I have been on an antidepressant since I was 19. I'm 34 now. My doctor thinks I could be borderline bipolar 2 since there always seems to be something surfacing when just on an SSRI and Klonipin combo. So she's been playing Guinnea pig with me the last few years to try and find the right combo. I react poorly to everything. Been on 21 drugs. Can't ever stay on the add ons. Anyways for the longest time I just stayed on the lexapro klonipin combo but things started to feel off again and she added on Latuda in the fall. At first it worked ok but then side effects kicked in a couple months later, then they tried Vraylar which was bad, then rexulti which made me have crippling OCD and anxiety. I felt like I was obsessing over all my basic day to day functions. Worried about what to do with my day. Frozen in fear . Not able to function at work. Doctor upped the dose. Got better for a small amount of time but the crippling distress and fear would not leave. Finally lowered off that and went back on latuda. Was only on latuda for a week and I got blind spots and went to the ER. Doctor at the ER told me to stop the latuda.  Ok, currently I've been off the Rexulti for over a month , the latuda for 3 weeks. I'm feeling horrible. Stuck in fear and depression. Can hardly function. The days are dreadful I don't know what to do with myself. I can't put into words how bad this feels. The crying spells , the hopelessness the dread . And the massive anxiety and overthinking. My doc says that this could be my ""true"" form surfacing. But I KNOW I wasn't like this before I started the antipsychotics. I don't want to go back on one and make myself even worse. Constantly in this spiral. I'm still on the lexapro and the klonipin. They seem to be doing nothing now. Everything is so overwhelming. I go to bed at night in fear because I know how bad the morning will be.  Can anyone relate to this? Everything inside me wants to believe this is withdrawal of some sort. I have not been husband before outside of the time I had Paxil withdrawal. Any advice would be so appreciated because I'm stuck on my couch right now in severe mental pain.  Thank you "

I have had three episodes and my 3rd relapse happened recently in June of 2016. I was at the hospital for 1 week and I was released thinking that I was better, but I wasn't. At that time, when I met with my psychiatrist, she added Zyprexa along with Lithium that I was taking before and I gradually gained 10-15 pounds! That was my biggest issue and on top of that, I was still feeling paranoid and having anxiety attacks so both medications did not work out for me. I was also had psychosis and I started feeling depressed because I was unexpectedly hospitalized again and I questioned when I would be back to ""normal"" again as far as getting my happiness and active lifestyle back. I didn't like the fact that I gained weight and I was comparing myself before when I was smaller.  Then, I saw my doctor again and she took Zyprexa out and added Latuda with Lithium. Still, I wasn't comfortable and I guess I was anxious to get better and again, my issue was my weight gain so finally, she took Lithium and Latuda out and prescribed me with an FDA approved medication close to Lithium, LAMICTAL. I started with a low dosage but at times I would cry and get emotional with my mom telling her that I feel hopeless and I wonder if I will get better. I felt depressed but now I'm at 100mg which will increase to 200mg and I hope for a better change. Actually, the 100mg has slowly helped because I don't feel the way I felt before when I took the other meds. My only concern now is my weight and the fact that I will hopefully get back to my normal happy and active life. They say Lamictal makes you lose weight and it doesn't really make you gain weight, hopefully that is true. Thank you for reading my story. I hope I get a response. "

I would throw off my clothes (was at home), just as my stomach would start to burn. This would be such painful burning outside and inside that it brought me to me hands and knees, and I would start to crawl around in an effort to escape the pain for a couple of minutes. Then it would be over. I chose to stop the med as per recommendation, but these ""waves"" persisted while slowly decreasing in intensity over 2 days. I have never experienced anything like it, and I am bipolar for 50 years. I know this is not a described reaction and have been told that it doesn't sound like lamotrigine"".

I would like to try it again, but wish to hear from anyone who has had an unusual experience like mine. Please note: I am not describing heartburn, stomach upset or a rash.

The Strattera wasn't cutting it, so that was switched to the Adderall XR. I was left on the Wellbutrin SR. I also take 0.5 mg of Clonazepam 3 times a day for anxiety (it also helps with menopausal symptoms, especially hot flashes.) I believe that getting my official diagnosis at the age of 55 has compounded matters. I had self diagnosed ADD in my twenties but had no idea what it fully encompassed. My symptoms increased with the onset of menopause, but they skyrocketed when I became caffeine sensitive and had to cut my coffee consumption to about a tenth of what it was. I didn't realize that I had been self medicating with caffeine since I was 14 years old. I also did not realize that the ADHD affects literally every aspect of my life. (I wish I had known that 2 husbands and dozens of jobs ago.) At least I now know that I'm ""not just a screw up"". That there was a reason why I am the way I am. My insurance does not cover a life coach and I'm not sure that it even covers therapy. I really can't afford to pay for those luxuries, as I am currently unemployable in my present circumstances.

Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://www.drugs.com/answers/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd-622088.html,"Vyvanse - How fast does your tolerance build up, how do you recognize the signs & cope with it?","In september my doctor prescribed Vyvanse for my add and i started treatment at 30mg. The next week, she increased my dosage to 40mg and I stayed at that dosage until the end of october when i then went up to 60mg. The jump from 40mg to 60mg seemed to do the trick, my focus and energy were amazing, i was making lists and starting to organize my life. Now I know I have a very high drug tolerance and with other drugs I have built up a resistance fairly quickly. When we increased my dosage to 60mg I expressed these concerns to my doctor since I was aware that the maximum recommended dosage is 70mg. She advised me to not worry about that since it is only a recommendation and with my weight and drug metabolization we could possibly increase further if it got to that point. So here I am nearly one month later to the day and I feel like I'm backsliding. I'm struggling to focus and my agitation frequency and intensity has just risen dramatically. I'm sure that this is in part because of the holiday season approaching and partly because of the situational stress in my life but I also feel like I'm at my breaking point. I have a 2 year old and when I reach these lows it's very hard for me to maintain my sanity in general, so throw a toddler and overbearing mother into the mix and the result is increasing panic attacks and overwhelming lethargy. My plan is to get into the doctor to discuss all this with her on Friday, I'm not trying to be a hero and try to fight it on my own. I also see two therapists, one for my panic disorder and also one whom is an ADD specialist. So, my question is...  Have any of you had the same thing happen? How fast does your tolerance build up? And how do you recognize the signs and cope with it? I just need a sounding board with other people whom can relate. I'm the only person in my family who is treated for ADD and my familial relationships suffer because they can't relate to how I feel or why I am the way I am. The first question everyone asks when I'm having a worse day is ""did you take your pills today?"" and I hate that because it makes me feel like they expect the pills to be a miracle cure for my behavior and that any change in my mood is because I'm neglecting my treatment, which I have never done. That in turn makes me more angry and irate and makes it even more difficult to move forward into a good day. I'm an emotionally driven person and it makes me so sad that no one can understand and empathize with how much work it takes to make each day a good day.  I just need a friend who I can talk to and who can try to understand without judging or criticizing, but as most of you know, making friends is hard. Especially for an ADD person like me "

Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://www.drugs.com/answers/recall-generic-adderall-tabs-mg-manufactuer-3014043.html,Recall on Generic Adderall tabs ALL mg by manufactuer Actavis?,"Has anyone else been taking the Generic Adderall - Orange pill, from manufacturer Actavis?? I have been taking 30mg x2 a day of this brand since November 2015. It worked absolute wonders!!  On Saturday, 2/27, I went to fill my Adderall RX and when taking it out once I got home, I noticed it was a round pink pill. First thoughts were - New manufacturer, the pharmacist gave me the wrong medicine or the Dr wrote it wrong. I searched it on pill identifier and it WAS the correct Adderall 30mg, so thinking not much about it, I took my first dose. 3 hours later, I break it in half and take 15mg, and 3 hours after that, I take the other half 15mg.  I thought I was going to have a heart attack!!! My head was spinning a mile a minute with things I had get done right I away as if it were life and death if I didn't hurry and for example: fold the clothes in the dryer. My heart was racing, I was talking a mile a minute, jumping from one story to the next, talking aloud of everything I need to do, started about 5 different things to do, not finishing any of them and forgetting even where I left off!  My husband asks: Are you OK??? I said No, not at all, something is wrong, I think I got bad medicine, I can't slow down, I cant stop moving and my heart and head is racing. We have 3 sons, 7 y/o twins and 2 y/o. The twins are both Type 1 diabetic, it was time to check their glucose and give them insulin. My husband is begging me to stop and call the pharmacy or Dr. or he would take me to the ER. I was freaking out, telling him I have to check the boys sugar first, they still need their shots, and baths, and the bay needs dinner, I don't think I got everything out of my car, I had 2 more bags of groceries, etc, etc. etc, I'm searching the entire house for 2 bags, run back when I realize I haven't checked the twins blood sugar. He finally sat me down, gave me the phone and Adderall RX while he took care of the kids. Because of their health problems I am in the pharmacy on a regular basis getting medicines and diabetic supplies and we all know each by name. I called and when the pharmacist asked how I was, I told her not good, not at all. she then got nervous. I asked her to please hurry and double check the Adderall script I had dropped off because it is not what I normally take and about to drive up the wall. Come to find out - it was a different manufacturer called Corepharma. She said the pills for Actavis had been recalled and the Corepharma is what they sent her for generic. The Actavis Adderall XR (capsules) were fine though. I told her I would call my dr first thing in the morning to see what he recommended because there was no way I could ever take that pill again. I asked if any other patients had called with the same side effects or any bad side effects and no one had. I get up 3 am every morning for work - I could not sleep at all that night, had been up since 3am, had 2 sick children with the flu home from school the following day and my dr was in the other office that day and i had to drive an hour to get to him. I gave him the bottle of pills, kept the MedGuide info sheet - because I want t report it! and he switched me to brand name Adderall XR 30mg at 3 am when I wake up and 10mg of the XR at 1pm. The pharmacy had to order the 10mg XR, so I am only taking the 30 mg in the morning and the XR is not quite as effective as the Actavis pills I was taking.  Has anyone else had a problem with this or does anyone else currently take Corepharma tabs? If so - how does it affect you? Any recommendations for a different generic manufacturer for the regular Adderall tabs not XR? Actavis worked like a charm and I'm bothered that it was recalled. Thanks all! "

Im not really sure what i was expecting, but atleast something a little more thurough than that. if youre familiar with adhd im sure you know what questions they ask, all of the questions struck a bell with me but one, the one about feeling like you are driven by a motor. he prescibed me adderall 10mg once a day on class day to test the waters and told me to come back in a month so we could decide if that dose was too high, too low, he didnt really go into any detail about the condition, symptons or how the meds work. (dose was too low, i took 10mg looked at my homework and took a nap, haha) i realize he's a general doctor and not a specialist on the subject, but if youre doling out diagnosis, i generally want to know what exactly i have been diagnosed with, and what it entails. so it kind of made me nervous that i didnt relate to the driven by a motor question and it worried that i might not have ADHD at all but taking medication for it. After my own research, ive concluded that i do in fact have ADHD primerally inattentive type. i have also concluded that it is not late onset, bc i have always didplayed these symptoms(i still even have specific memories from 1st and 2nd grade that could probably be related). im obviously not a doctor, but i know my my behavior and thought patterns better than anyone else could. i know myself and the way i think but im not in anyone elses mind and im not a doctor that is educated on how a heathly brain should function which is why i never sought help with it in the first place, i just assumed the way my brain works is the same as everyone around me. since the 10mg didnt do anything, i took it upon myself to up my dosage to 2 pills, and my thoughts can finally go in a pace that is slow enough for me to connect them to eachother and i can find things interesting for long enough to actually absorb them, im becoming more motivated. i saw my doctor today, basically just told him 10mg was too weak and i that i wanted to see if it could help me with day to day things im wanted to take it daily thoughout the day to see if that helped the things that are sub par in my day to day life, so he prescribed 20mg twice daily. but again he didnt really give me any insight about how i should feel while on the medication, things to look for to know if the dosage is correct.he's just kind of letting me guess at it. So im finally to my question... how do you know that youre taking the correct dosage? im assuming that the benifits would at some point platuea. Most of the symtoms are not complely definative and can be skewed, and most are so common to everyone at some point, but now i realize they are not generally so chronic or have such a large effect on day to day life. so how do you know if what youre expiencing is a symptom that can still be improved on by medication, or just part of the human condition? how do you choose a dosage? trial and error? im content with this current dose. but how do you know if a higher dose could be more beneficial and what point do you decide that youre recieving the peak benefits when youre not sure what they are. its like when i was young and needed glasses, i had no idea i needed glasses, i just assumed that blurry was how things looked, it wasnt until a school eye exam that the nurse realized i needed glasses and once i got them, i was amazed at how crisp and clear lines were, i had no idea thats what everyone else was already seeing with 20/20 vision. but with ADD the lines arent so clear, so how do you know when youre at 20/20?

Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://www.drugs.com/answers/ritalin-la-concerta-er-2719100.html,Ritalin LA vs. Concerta (ER)?,"After several attempts to find which ADHA medication that worked for my child, Ritalin LA 20 mg. did the trick (all the non-extended medications were wearing off around 1:00 PM). He takes one 20 mg. capsule at 7:20 AM with breakfast, has a good school day, and the medication is worn off around 4:30 PM. He has a healthy appetite at diner and has no problem falling asleep at bedtime. He only takes the medication on days he attends school (never weekends, holidays or vacation).  I just found out via a letter from my insurance company they will no longer cover the Ritalin LA 20 mg. (generic: Methylphenidate LA), but they will pay for Methylphenidate ER 20 mg tablet and Regular (no extended-release) Methylphenidate 20 mg tablet). I looked up the name Methylphenidate ER, and it is sold as the generic for Concerta. My research has revealed, Ritalin LA does not last as long as Concerta (no mention of Concerta ER just Concerta) and has a unique delivery system called OROS. Of course, his doctor and I will discuss this, as I'm concerned because a healthy appetite and a good nights sleep in just as important. My friend's child takes Concerta and the poor thing never sleeps and hardly eats anything. I know medication effects every child differently, but this Concerta sounds like a whole different medication.  I'm not crazy about changing his ADHD medication in the middle of a school year, but as a single parent with only one income, the cost would make a dent in my monthly budget (30 day supply cost $180.00 or $2,160.00 per year).

Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://www.drugs.com/answers/what-happened-to-the-price-of-generic-adderall-it-449501.html,"What happened to the price of generic Adderall; it used to be 27.75, now it has gone up to over 67?","For some reason Adderall seems to be the only medication that has been affected like this. I've been taking generic Adderall for over three years and have done very well with it. I have ADHD. I was prescribed 120 mg per day until I moved to Missouri. Since I didn't have the medical insurance or the money for a doctor very often, when I was able to see a doctor they were uncomfortable prescribing such a high level of Adderall. So, for the last year and a half I've had to manage on half my dosage plus whatever my wife would give me, she has the same script. The last time I bought the Adderall generic, the round orange pill 30mg. at Walgreens it was 47.00+, then on August 5th I was given a list of web sites that might be able to help with prescription drugs with people who didn't have their own insurance. I checked out the first web site and I was amazed! Adderall was only 27.75, I'd been getting raped for a year! But today I tried to get my script filled with my missouridrugcard and was told that they didn't honor that card anymore for that particular drug. The Adderall was now 67.00+. I said that I was sorry but I just can't afford that. When I got back home I got back on-line and checked the site again on the price checker and sure enough everyone in the St. Louis area had gone up to the same 67.00+. What the hell happened? I know that the college kids like them for their studies, but I don't sell mine. I use them because I need them. During the few times over the last over three years I've been deprived of my medications for a week or two, but I don't react like other people do; I didn't go through withdrawals, I just couldn't concentrate and got sidetracked easily. Without the adderall I'll be a bit scatter brained, won't be able to finish things that I start. I just won't be the same. What happened to the medication? I thought that it was just because it was a schedule II narcotic, but I checked the other medications that are narcotics and they haven't changed at all. "

He was diagnosed with a mild case of ADD, where he can not focus and he gets bored easily in class, especially if he already knows it. He is really fidgety in his class and his teacher said that he would not keep still. I have been dealing with this with him since he was in 1st grade. His teacher told me to bring him to the doctor to see if he had ADD. I started him on the weekend so that I could monitor him at home first. The first day on Vyvanse 30mg he played a football game and was so focused and made such a great tackle that the coach of the other team found him after the game and told him how awesome he played. When we got home that same day his talent came out, which was building. He found pieces of wood around the house and built himself a wooden car from scratch. He also has become a clean freak, which I love, because I don't have to pick up behind him anymore. The following Monday at school his teacher told me how she noticed a major difference. She said he was more attentive and asked questions, which was something he did not usually do. When he finished school last year he had made a major improvement. He was basically a ""C"" student and now he is a ""A/B"" student. One Friday his teacher posted on edline that they had a social studies test on Monday and she had given them a study guide. Well, my son forgot his on his desk and did not study for the test. I emailed his teacher and told her that he may not do good on the test because he forgot his study guide and he did not have his book. Needless to say on Wednesday the teacher sent the test papers home and he had made a 94%. I was shocked, but his teacher told me that he just pays so much more attention in class. At the end of the school year she advised me that Colby was her best disciplined child in her class and she wish everyone was like him. HIs biggest problem was he was talkative. When he is on Vyvanse he is alert and does not talk as much. Which has its advantages and disadvantages. He already loved math, but now his interest is so high in math. One day his teacher said he went to details about how to do a simple division problem. At home he does his homework immediately and if anyone is disruptive in the house he is the one who will tell them they either need to be quite or go outside so he can do his work. He has had to go up to 70mg in the past 6 months, because I found that he got so adjusted to the medicine quickly.  The major problem I have with him is that he does not go to sleep until 1am-2am in the morning, because he basically is not sleepy at all. I have read post that says applesauce or apple juice is good for them to take with Vyvanse. He usually drinks kool-aide, which may be too much sugar. I will try the applesauce/apple juice starting tomorrow. Any other suggestions? Otherwise Vyvanse is a miracle drug. For a parent who was against drugging my child, it has definitely helped him in school and even in sports. "

But about a month ago I decided with starting a new job I should be on my best game so I went to a psychiatrist and we started testing out different doses. First we tried taking one 10mg two times a day (didn't help) went to one 20mg two times a day (getting closer) then found that 30mg three times a day worked best for me.  So... with my last visit to the doctor he gave me an increased prescription for the medicine and so I went to the pharmacy to get it filled (I had about half a bottle left from previous visit) and the pharmacist said I couldn't get it refilled due to insurance reasons and to come back in a week or two. I said ok. Fast forward a week and a half. Go back with prescription to get it filled seeing as how I have two days left with my previous prescription. Pharmacist says I can't get it refilled due to it being a controlled substance and I need to wait another 11 days before I can get a refill. Me being new to the whole controlled substance situation I wasn't aware of these time restrictions. I'm just worried that this pharmacist thinks I'm abusing my medicine or something (it was the same lady both times) but really I was just taking more to follow the regiment my doctor and I had discussed and therefore, was bound to run out early.  Mind you, I did tell the pharmacist that we changed my dosage and therefore I'm almost out (she got a bit sassy thinking I was trying to get my prescription early but I know she's just doing her job).

But this pharmacist would occasionally lend him a few if he was running short and deduct it from his next script. After two years he asked the dr to put him on something cheaper and was given the pain patches and other stuff. He took the adderal to his old pharmacist near his home and was told they were NOT adderal. Is that possible? With adderall XR, do they only come with the little beads inside or do they have a company who makes a powder? "
Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://www.drugs.com/answers/concerta-changes-side-effects-stop-working-581667.html,Concerta - Are these changes side effects or did it stop working?,"My 8 year old son has been taking Concerta for about 2 months for ADHD. The first week or so was miserable. He was angry and stressed out and aggressive. I wanted to stop the meds, but was told to let them start doing their job. Since then, everything has been wonderful. He cleans the house, reads tons of books and plays nicely with his 6 year old brother. He's on summer break, but I assume his grades would be much higher if he was in school. For the last week, it's been different. He's not quite as hyper and destructive as he was before the meds, but he's not as well behaved as he was a few weeks ago. He gets very emotional, which is unusual for him, all the time. He refuses to do as he's told. He screams at his brother and I. He is out of control- until he's not. If he's riding his bike or watching tv, he's perfect. It seems like hes mad at me. If I ask him to do anything at all, its a fight. Bedtime is a fight. Dinner. Showers. Everything. It's either his way or no way. Does this mean the medicine is no longer working? Or is this a side effect? I can't tell because he didn't just go back to the way he was before Concerta. I don't know what to do. "

I just picked up my month's supply of Adderall (20 mg twice daily) at CVS no less. I?,"... looked at the tablets when I got home and thought they were from SANDOZ which I usually get, took a tablet and headed out the door. For some reason I didn't feel the med was working quite the same and when I got home I discovered the brand name was AUROBINDO. I opened the bottle and took a tablet, and for that reason returning the prescription is not an option; I'm stuck with it. I'm wondering if anyone in our group has been given this brand and, if so, what was their experience. I MAY be simply imagining that since the tablet isn't SANDOZ then it's not up to snuff. Only I'm a little suspicious. I did a little research on AUROBINDO and read some really bad press. What can I say, guys? The med is mine to have and to hold for the next 30 days. I don't want to draw negative energy into this docu-drama and thereby have my lousy expectations become a reality; maybe the brand is OK. So any feedback will be welcomed.  One thing I DO want to mention is this: If you don't want to be surprised when you pick up your meds, be sure your lines of communication between your pharmacy of choice and you are open and clear. I called my doctor and learned (and learned sadly too late) that once you walk out of the pharmacy with the a medication and find it's not what you expected, at least in New York State it's then too late to return it. Certainly once you get home with the med and take one, you're stuck with it. BTW... someone had asked a question about a powdery substance that is methamphetamine and could be legally purchased and my reply offended that person. For that I am so very sorry; that wasn't my intent, and I do apologize. "

Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://www.drugs.com/answers/general-adhd-questions-dexedrine-vs-adderall-98394.html,General ADHD questions (Dexedrine vs. Adderall?)?,"After a 2nd baby girl has come my way and a year of nursing, I am finally ready to begin treatment for ADHD again. I have had awful luck with doctors in the past that treat me with such attitude and distrust that i'm intimidated to even ask any questions about the medication. I finally found a good psychotherapy office where i have gotten to know the councelor/doctor well and they are helping me test different treatments to see whats right for me. Unfortunately, now that i just have quick appointments with the woman that writes prescriptions, i don't have very much time to ask random questions. FYI: My insurance does not cover any kind of time released treatment.  I don't have another appointment with the dr. for a month and what i am currently taking doesn't seem to work so well, so i thought i'd try asking my questions here.  I naturally have a very high tolerance to anything possibly due to a hormonal problem i was treated for throughout my entire childhood and I don't want to have to take too much more than the recommended dosage of any amphetamine for it to work.  Basically my questions are: ))What is the difference between Dexedrine and Adderall? (non time released adderal) ))Are there different drugs for ADD than there are for ADHD? (i am much more on the hyperactive scale than the listless daydreamer type) ))What is the difference between Dextroamphetamine and just plain Amphetamine? ))What are the short/long term effects of regularly taking more than the suggested/average dosage for adults? (i don't mean pill popping and taking a bunch at once, i am prescribed 80 milligrams a day of amphet/dextroamphet combo tablet, 40 in the morning and 40 late afternoon, which the pharmacist says is higher than the average). ))Lastly, at my last appointment we briefly discussed the possibility of me taking less of a dosage at once, but 3 times a day instead of 2. What the pros/cons to that method, not including the slight inconvenience of having to actually do it 3 times a day? If anyone has any real advice or answers i would really appreciate having some solid questions to ask my PCNS by my next appointment.  MORE INFO: Current usage/tested dosages: I really don't know exactly what i'm talking about, but if i had to guess i think the right dosage for me would be to only take 30 milligrams (or maybe even 25 if that's possible) but take it 3 times a day instead of twice. Adderall XR and these non-time released tablets do absolutely nothing for me at 20 milligrams or lower. Last month when i was testing 30 milligrams of the non-time released tablets, it really seemed to work the best, but it only lasted around 2 hours. I can tell by the way i start not realizing how much time has passed, walking around the house forgetting what i went into rooms to do, and suddenly feeling pangs of hunger even though i ate breakfast only about 3 hours earlier.  However, shortly after taking them (30 mil) it really felt like THATS what being treated for ADHD is supposed to feel like. I don't know why back in highschool when i saw people abuse them they act like they're all cracked out. It actually calms me down, almost like it relaxes my thoughts. I became more scheduled and actually finished tasks when i started them without starting other things during it. So at my latest appointment, because it left my system so fast, we tried raising my prescription to 40 (2x a day). I don't like it. I can't explain it but it doesn't seem like it helps anything, i can tell there is something different in my body but overall it seems to just make me anxious and irritated.  Therefor, i am thinking when she mentioned something about taking less more times a day is what could be right for me. The most important question there is simply what harm can be done by me regularly taking 90 milligrams of amphetamines a day. HIGH TOLERANCE?: If the question of body tolerance needs more info to answer anything, i had precocious puberty and have always been very large my whole life (i don't mean just fat, i mean a good 6+ inches taller than anyone else in my class too, and never connecting with the other kids as if i was literally years older than them) I was treated with Lupron for at least 6 years that i can remember, which apparently is considered bad now... I don't know if the condition itself or possibly the drug i was treated with is why my tolerance to drugs are so high or if its just natural, because now at age 22 i am 5'5'' and slightly overweight at around 148 lbs.  I don't drink alcohol, i just don't like the sensation of being drunk nor do i like the taste, and since it takes so much for me to even feel slightly buzzed i just stopped bothering and have become the permanent designated driver to my friends.  I have the same problem with painkillers, any time in my life i have been to the ER and given painkillers it seems like i have to take twice the dosage they gave me to even be slightly comfortable. Having all my wisdom teeth out at once and finishing my week long prescription of painkillers in less than 2 days was the most drawn out, most painful, most miserable days of my life. The bottle said to take ""half"" of one (Loratab?) and it literally did nothing unless i took 2 full ones. Tylenol/Ibuprofen/Asprin are just jokes.  I am by no means a druggie, I actually really don't like anything that makes me feel like i am not in control of my body. I would like to live my life with the same focus and clarity that i feel like most everyone else has, and takes for granted. I am tired of being treated like some kind of drug dealer, i have had 3 doctors now prescribe me Adderall XR, up my dosage to 20 mil (a day!) and refuse any more than that. I finally found a really nice woman that didn't judge me and completely agrees that i have ADHD and who better than me to actually be prescribed its treatment. But i don't want to hurt my body in my long run, and if taking 80-90 milligrams of this drug a day is going to seriously hurt me in some way, its not worth it.  Thanks for taking the time to read this, if you know anything about this stuff (aside from being some coked up highschool kid that just abuses it, i'm sick of responses from any drug abusers/sellers out there) i would very much appreciate some insight. Thanks again. "

Well i started with other ADHD drugs and then found Vyvanse which works well but doesn't last through the day. So they kept upping the Vyvanse to 70 mg and then a bump of Adderall 10 mg at noon. I need to say during I was also taking pain meds for what became chronic pain after 5 failed back surgeries. Well i refused to increase my pain meds and in fact quit taking them because I'm in pain with them or without. I haven't taken any pain meds for over 3 months now. I really think now I'm taking to much ADHD meds now without taking pain meds. and wanted to know will the government which now regulates the way prescriptions are written let me take only Vyvanse 30 mg twice a day or is there some kind of rule how the meds. are prescribed? Does anyone know true facts. I want to talk to my dr. but I have to have facts in hand because of government regulations.

Just a warning this is going to be a long question so you can understand the full extent of my problem...  So I started taking Vyvanse a little more than year and a half ago, and was on it for about 7 or 8 months at 70mg once daily, I stopped taking it almost a year ago... As soon as I started taking it I realized that my breathing got really bad. I was always having to take really deep breaths because it felt like I couldn't catch my breath and even then it didn't always work. I tried to yawn, hoping that would work and it never did. It's now a year later and I'm STILL having these problems. I've seen a bunch of people post about this issue when they're on it, but never about it continuing after stopping the medication. What I'm asking is, has anyone experienced this after stopping the medication for a year? And if so is there ANYTHING they did that helped? I'm desperate at this point and will try anything, it happens every day and I can't do a lot of things anymore, even talking has become a project because it causes me shortness of breath. TIA "

I never quite realized it (since I typically only take the pills during the semester), but it was making me REALLY anxious. (Heart palpitations, fight-flight feeling, general anxiety, etc.) I only put it together when I took a pill at the end of spring break (no classes or other stressors), and about an hour later (when it was metabolized, I assume) started feeling that way really badly. I haven't taken it since...  I also don't think it was really helping me all that much, beyond giving me a bit of energy, and wearing me out so I could sleep sooner. (Which was helpful, but it wasn't really doing anything for focus, etc.) I had Ritalin as a kid, and teachers noticed no real difference. (neither did I, but what did I know at 8 years old?) I figured I'd skip that one this time around (almost 30 years later) as well...  I see the dr. in a couple of weeks. My question is this...  Adderall seems to work best for *so* many people, but given that it's basically 75% the same as Vyvanse, I wasn't sure whether I should ask to try swapping to it, or whether I would just have the same side effect... Especially since you only get 1 prescription fill (of anything) per 30 days... So if it happens to do the same thing, I'm up a creek for a month. :( I realize that it's a shot in the dark, every drug is different, etc... But if someone has an adverse reaction to Vyvanse, do they typically have the same side effect on Adderall?  Is there a usual culprit for this reaction?

We don't want him to think the pills will solve his problem and he doesn't have to work at it at all.

He stopped all of them cold turkey for about a week because of the adderall/ritalin shortages and finally had to order them online. He decided to stop using zoloft altogether.  He's been back on the adderall and ritalin now for about 1.5-2 weeks. I'm not sure what kind (XR e.g.)/dosages he's taking, but the adderall is taken in the morning and the ritalin at night.  Question: The alarming thing is ever since he started taking the drugs in the last couple of weeks, he seems super tired/drunk or on downers - slurred speech, slowed speech, clumsiness, tiredness, confusion. I've seen this happen to him before when he's been extremely tired, but it would happen every few months, not every day. The other thing is some days out of the last couple of weeks he's been like that all day, but other times it happens within 5 minutes - he'll be fine, and suddenly get this glazed look in his eyes and start acting strange.  When I ask him if he's OK and tell him he's acting strange, he always says he feels fine, or maybe ""just tired."" Is this at all feasibly linked to the week off of everything? Is he just getting used to the drugs again? I know for a fact it's not alcohol. Does it sound like another prescription/illegal drug besides the ones I know he's taking?

He was unable to focus in school to the point where he was falling way behind the other kids. He was also having difficulty with his behavior. He couldn't sit still, stop talking out of turn, keep his hands to himself, following simple directions or focus long enough to read a book. His behavior at home was even worse. He would not listen, was constantly talking back/very defiant, continuously hitting his sisters for no reason or because he didn't like what they said, and whenever we tried to discipline him, he would scream and yell at my husband and I not caring at all about being in trouble. Fearing he was falling way behind in school and our inability to take his behavior anymore, we took him to the doctors in November and along our input and with the help of his teachers (current 2nd grade teacher as well as his previous first grade teacher) he diagnosed with ADHD and put on Focalin XR 15mg.

He is fighting with kids on the bus, being respectfulness to the bus driver, not sitting still in his seat and his behavior when he gets home is worse.

For 3 months I was taking Adderall 20XR in the morning and another 10-20 IR throughout the day depending on how my day was going. No day was ever the same. I work long hours and felt as if the Adderall wore off too quickly. I was recently started on Mydayis 20 mg. I am not experiencing the crashes I was with Adderall and I feel like it gets me through the day better than the Adderall was. I do notice that two times throughout the day I am forgetting the smallest little things. My times of forgetfulness don’t last too long. I am assuming that these are the times right before the next dose is released. I also have a little less energy than I normally have ( even before starting medication).

Schools SUCK!?","I'm so confused. Why is it that all of a sudden every young boy has ADHD? Before it was ADD but now they are considered hyperactive as well. Since when does the government and society have the right to say who is normal and who is not? I thought boys were supposed to be more hyper than girls. That's in their nature. Now it's a brain malfunction because teachers want them to sit still and not call out if they know the answer. Smh I've met with every social worker in the school, almost got acs called on me because of his behavior, meet a behavior therapist every week, and now I've met a psychiatrist who gave me meds for him. Yea just give them meds and problem solved right? I'm a better parent because I'm doing what the doctor says? Back in the day the kids got a good butt spanking. That was the home remedy for adhd. They have taken that away. They told me don't spank him because he will be more violent. Because of his brain disease. Come on. Every since then he been worse. Now we rely on the internet to help us raise our children. I feel stuck. I feel like a bad parent and I feel like if I don't give him his meds I will get in trouble. The school puts so much pressure on me I just cry. He just started acting like this age 7. His grades dropped and everyone's making it seem like meds will make all my problems go away. I don't know what to do. I was thinking of letting him live with my aunt for a year so I can finish school and better both of our lives, p.s I was a teen mom, but now I can't work or go to school because he's acting a fool in class. He's been prescribed Concerta 18 methylphenidate. I've refused to give it to him because I've read horrible side effects or maybe I'm just scared to give a child medicine when there is no official study about this. The testing is entirely based off opinion. I really don't know what to do at this point. He's suspended once again, and the iep process has took 3 months. He's still in a class of 30 kids one teacher and they wonder why he's acting the same. They said dept of ed isnt paying for teachers aides. Plus we have to fight to get a para. Futhermore how on God's green earth is a child with ADHD going to learn when they are teaching COMMON CORE!!! It's way too many steps. If anything our children are way advanced, bored, and are so infactuated with technology that, that's what they need to be learning on. Not old textbooks and dusty library materials. They should all have kindles and be emailing their teachers their homework just like how the colleges are doing now. It's not our fault the schools aren't advancing with the times, now our kids can't pay attention. Give me a break. He sure pays attention to that leap frog and tablet. Smh. Sorry this is more of a rant than a question but this is my first time on the site, and I have been searching high and low for a support group in NYC. There aren't any. Anyone else on Concerta? How do you feel about kids and meds? I can't stop crying knowing something is wrong with my baby. Like forreal. "

Just a warning and apology ahead of time, this will be a long and detailed situation considering he is very eager to resolve this. 3 weeks ago today he started taking adderall in the morning and dextroamphetamines in the evening for his ADD. Since taking the medication when he has tried running he has been feeling very out of shape. For clarification, a couple days before taking the medication he ran 10 miles at 7:20 mile pace non-stop right after a week and a half off from running because of a stomach virus he had. After he started taking his ADD medication (adderall and dextroamphetamines) he tried to run 10 miles again and could only make it to 5 and half miles. To add to that he very rarely gets sore and didn't get sore after that 10 mile run after a long break, but did get sore after that 5 and half mile run. Even though we are already sure it does, does adderall or dextroamphetamine cause muscle/physical weakness and/or diminishing in physical shape? And if it is, what should we do as a solution? Also keep in mind stopping the use of ADD medication/treatment is not a possible option, as he needs it. Thank you. "

I am going to the walk-in clinic tomorrow morning, but want a general idea of what is up with me before I go. Background: I made an appointment to the gynecologist after noticing a fishy smell in my discharge. It turned out I had bacterial vaginosis because my soap messed up my pH levels. I was prescribed the metronidazole tablets at first and took two a day for three out of the seven days. I kept spitting them up and gagging, so I refused to take them for two days and called the doctor for a different medication. She then prescribed me the metronidazole vaginal gel that I would take once every night for 5 days. I took it for two days and then started my period after I took it for the second time that night. (Worst. period. ever. Woke up from pain, ended up fainting and going to ER.) So I was afraid and stopped taking the medicine for four days. Now I took it last night, the night before, and only have tonight left (no more tubes to use after that)...  Now: I have been having a very thick white and brown slimy discharge. Some parts are stringy and some are just gross cottage cheesy (I see people say that on the internet)... There is no foul odor from the discharge. No pain when I pee, except I did notice a stronger scent. No pain or itching around the vagina. I've been having this kind of discharge probably since I got off of my period, though in the beginning it was just brown and really slimy looking. Is this the bacteria coming out of me? Or could I have a yeast infection as I read other people say? Thanks. "

I have my first appointment to see a?,"psychiatrist next week and would appreciate any advice or opinions. Obviously this is a self diagnosis and I don't want to come across as being a big know it all. Apparently I have issues that i feel need to be addressed. I have been doing quite a bit of research on many disorders because of a few reasons. Unfortunately I have been a drug user since i was 14 years old. I come from a huge and close family and both of my parents have anxiety disorders. My older sister was recently diagnosed as bi-polar. Though, my parents are old fashioned and don't believe in medication. Therefore I didn't see many doctors growing up, let alone a psychiatrist. I went through a problem with opiates about 3 years ago. I've always had back problems and so I thought of it as self medicating. I am a hair dresser and on my feet all day 6 days a week. Anyhow, I finally realized I couldn't stand being controlled by roxys anymore so I went to see a suboxone doctor. I was immediately put on the medication and have been on it for 6 months. I have always wondered why I have been a drug user.. from cigarrettes to weed and my phases with other substances. I never did well in school due to lack of interest and difficulty with comprehension. I cant tell you how many times i get lost in my sentences and completely forget what I was talking about. I have severe seperation anxiety and am super emotional. I think my mother  also shows many signs of adhd as well. Anyways, I won't drag this on any longer but I suppose I just wanted to reach out and get a little input from anyone that may have something to say or how to approach my shrink when I have a hard enough time talking about my feelings and staying focused on what I'm trying to say.

(One dose instantly then another +/- 4hrs. later.) I'm currently taking one 20mg XR in the morning and then a 20mg IR in the evening, but from how I feel and from what I've read online that's actually coming out to doses of: 10mg, 10mg, 20mg. Am I right? Because I feel the best on 20mg IR but my psychiatrist seems reluctant to switch to a higher dose of the extended release capsules. I can't tell if he doesn't understand how Adderall XR works or if there's just something here I'm not getting. The thing is, I'm so relieved that I can finally pay attention to anything that I'm pretty much willing to take what I can get. I feel like I should be maintaining a level dose throughout the day, and if that's an important enough issue then I'll switch to a lower dose of the instant release, but I would obviously prefer to stay at 20mg since that's been working great for a few months now. Sorry for the lengthy explanation post but this is really bothering me and I don't know how to bring this up with my psychiatrist without sounding like I'm angling for a bigger fix or accusing him of getting my meds wrong.

Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://www.drugs.com/answers/prescription-generic-adderall-work-3456717.html,Why doesn’t my prescription generic Adderall work for me?,"I am a relatively healthy 21 year old male who is 5’11” & 155lbs. I have never done any kind of recreational drug in the past and I very rarely use alcohol.  I was recently diagnosed with ADHD primarily inattentive type and started on generic Adderall 5mg IR for the next two weeks as a starting dose. I may have had unrealistic expectations when I thought that Adderall would be some miracle drug that could solve all of my attention problems & daily life struggles, but I thought it would work better than this. I have been on Adderall for three days now and I know it is a really low dose, but I’m worried it’s not worth the side effects. Is this a typical response for a new user of Adderall?: 1. I feel more tired when on it. It may be a coincidence as I also have an odd sleeping pattern that causes me to feel jet lagged sometimes, but I’m really starting to think it’s the Adderall causing it. I can easily fall asleep after taking this medication. 2. I notice I am a bit more aware of my body. This, again, may simply be a coincidence as I’ve had a back pain for about the last 8 months and the past few days I’ve just noticed it more. It could just be a flare up in pain or I slept on it wrong, but there’s that. 3. I have noticed slight improvement in my focus, but it hasn’t been much of anything. I notice the ADHD symptoms a bit more, but that could also be because I’m more informed about the disorder now. Like while on the Adderall, I still walk into rooms and completely forget what I am doing. I did that over and over again just like usual and nothing is different.  4. I have noticed that I am a little less apprehensive about starting projects that I’ve been holding off on, but I think that’s placebo effect.  5. I have noticed none of the listed side effects of the medication though. So it doesn’t appear to be harmful for me in the short term. There has been no psychotic breaks, no mood swings, no increase of blood pressure or heart rate, no loss of appetite, no allergies to the medication, no euphoria, no jittery or nervous behaviors, nothing that would signal stimulant medication is contraindicated for me. But there also seems to be no benefits.  Overall, if these symptoms scale up with the different doses I am on, this medication simply isn’t worth the possible side effects of long term use and the current effects I actually have. I’m a bit disappointed and frustrated. Is this a common thing with ADHD patients? Is it a problem with my body digesting the medicine? Do I not have ADHD so it doesn’t work? I’m really confused "

How do I get diagnosed as an adult with ADD?,"Growing up I was constantly labeled by teachers as easily distracted, it was a problem later on in high school but I shrugged it off since the work was easy. Now in college where I have a job and school it is causing major problems for me to stay focused in class, study, and submit projects to work (I mainly work from home). I procrastinate a lot no matter how much I plan ahead and do everything I can to stay focused, nothing seems to work. In fact I'm supposed to be writing a 5 page essay right now.  At college I am told by my school doctor that to get treated I have to go through a large process to be diagnosed (and hope its truly ADHD/ADD) and spend $600+ out of pocket. I don't have money to spend on that and my current therapist doesn't prescribe. I have to get my lexapro from my primary care doc for instance. I guess I'm kind of at my low and starting to give up on this but I want to know if theres another way that costs less. I go to school in DC but I live in Connecticut and I definitely want to take care of this there for insurance purposes.  Thanks everyone, I appreciate it. "

Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://www.drugs.com/answers/empowerplus-q96-viable-replacement-prescribed-928606.html,Is EMPowerplus Q96 a viable replacement for prescribed ADHD medication?,"I have been taking 2 forms of Ritalin for the past 4 years, having a moderate case of ADHD which has affected me in my teens up to now, I am currently 18 years old. I went to a chiropractor recently and he recommended this supplement and I purchased it. I have noticed that I have become dependent on my medication and that after 4 years of taking it that it may be bringing out some negative side effects. Can anybody tell me if this supplement is legitimate? I am very skeptical of it and I have just started taking it, it seems like it could work but I am not confident with it as it may not be as powerful as my regular medication, given that it isn't an over the counter product...  I could go and ask my doctor about this, but I am also concerned by the fact that my new doctor is more concerned about profit then health at the moment, so I am skeptical of approaching him about it, hence why I'm asking on here. I have been diagnosed with 2 mental disorders, ADHD at a moderate level and OCD at a mild to moderate level. I used to take medication for my OCD but it was affecting my health so I discontinued that medication. I may have also developed some anxiety disorders, part of it possible stemming from my OCD. I feel that EMPowerplus may help with these other side effects. For reference I take my regular medication 2 times a day, a 10mg short acting dose along with a 20mg long acting dose in the morning, and then another 10mg short acting dose after 4 to 6 hours. So I am basically looking for answers to tell me if this supplement is a good replacement. I just don't know about this as a replacement and if I should see about replacement over the counter medication. "

I've been on the vyvanse for about two weeks now. It definitely helps stop my mind from racing and I feel more at ease, but in the evening time I start to feel very strange... racing heart,anxiety, chest pain, I feel like my heart is skipping beats and fluttering. This doesn't happen every night but most. The last two nights (later on at night) I've been feeling so uncomfortably speedy, not physically but like... inside... my brain and my chest. I'm sorry, its very hard to explain this.I feel like I have to be doing something constantly, like folding clothes (basically nothing very physical though. I can't lay down or try to relax bc for one,my eyes won't shut, and also that's when my heart feels like its beating hard and fast and fluttering. I don't want to stop taking it BC i finally found a med that helps me concentrate and stops my mind from racing throughout the day atleast, and its so refreshing to be able to have my mind at ease but almost every night (so far ) I have had some sort of trouble with it. Some nights are better than others, and there have been nights where I feel chest pain and other overwhelming feelings but they go away after about an hour... there has been one,maybe two nights where it went pretty smooth all in all. can any one help me?

Its been an hour since I took MG's of xanax and I'm still so panicky from worrying that I will have another ""episode"" at night time the way I did the past two nights.

Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://www.drugs.com/answers/adderall-xr-25mg-suppose-couple-weeks-month-work-3041138.html,Is Adderall XR(25mg) suppose take a couple weeks/or a month to work?,"I have recently been diagnosed with ADD but supposedly its ADHD with a primarily inattentive subtype, however point being I was first on Concerta XR 52mg for close to 2 months(the least a month) but then I told my doctor the depression feeling had been bothering me and my ability to perform in sports at a excellent standard had dramatically lowered ever since I've been on Concerta. So he did not know how to solve the whole sports problem however he did then prescribe me with Adderall XR of 5mg and told me to slowly increase my dose 20mg or even 30mg if needed because he told me that a 52mg Concerta was the ""equivalent"" or close to the same amount. I started this process on March 25 and later told my mother that I think I found the right dosage because I thought I was concentrating during school but I think or I feel like it was because when I was on Concerta I was able to understand the lessons a lot better and since I started this process the week before school got out for Spring Break there were no new lessons given to us and all we really did was watch movies/played games and took notes, I also do remember myself not actively participating(academically) as much, mostly because I was talking to friends when were going over the previous lessons because I felt or I knew already what to do and there was no need in really listening as much. But when we weren't able to talk such as reading time stuff or when there was a handed out worksheet we did in class such as a crossword puzzle I did notice that I started getting a little distracted(often distracted) and less active in doing my assignment and began daydreaming from time to time and I was forgetful like before my meds but I told my self its most likely because I'm slowing increasing my ADHD meds. So I then got prescribed with Adderall XR 25mg on April 4th. And on the first day back from break(April 10th, I also took my pills during break) when my teachers started a new lesson I started noticing that I was getting distracted very often, and when I read instruction or even read a question I had to read it over and over to my self so many times that I skipped the question and later other questions because I simply couldn't understand it, and when my teacher asked me a question in front of the class I asked him to repeat it because I was unable to process the question fast enough and instead of me answering it my partner answered it instead, which I was suppose to answer because I was giving the information. So I now realized that my ADHD symptoms are back because the medication is not working just yet?- One of my IEP staff asked me if anything had changed from before and I told her everything that I said here except for how I started losing concentration because she asked if you are noticing that the Adderall medication is better than the Concerta and I told her I was more mild or I guess calmer than the Concerta because I thought before this conversation that I was having with her, that the Adderall was kind of working or slowly increasing on its own BUT she later told me that Adderall XR takes close to a month to actually have it start working and I then told my mother about this and she said that the doctor said that too but I didn't remember that or I was never told. So my question is, is that true? does it actually take a month on average to start noticing its effect(btw its been 10 days on my medication and I still feel my ADHD symptoms)? And if so does that mean I have to live with my ADHD symptoms for a month? SORRY FOR MAKING THIS SO LONG "

I took 200mg of provigil and a few hours later i had to take a nap. 400mg of provigil kept me awake for about 6 hours but my attention wasnt too good. After being tested for my ADD on 20mg of adderall i was still in the ADD range by quite a lot idk how accurate these psychologist test are. Currently I am on 30mg of adderall surviving.  Only one sleep study was done, I probably need to get the narcolepsy sleep study but i cant afford to be off stimulants for enough time to be tested and since I have sleep apnea diagnosis i can get provigil i just need a way to afford it...

He started kindergarten this year and he has problems following directions, keeping his hands to himself, listening, and sitting still. A couple of weeks ago he was on the bus and poked holes in the seat with an ink pen and also drew all over it. He also has to sit in a booster seat on the bus because he won't stay in his seat or listen to the bus driver!! I recently took him to the doctor and they seem very skeptical to put him on meds and I imagine it is in part because adhd meds are abused, so I was on here and saw that fish oil can be used to treat it, so I was just wondering how much to give him and if the fish oil works as well as the cns stimulants?? I have been diagnosed with adhd along with his brother and sister. I am on ritalin and my other kids were on concerta but we decided to take them off of it and they are doing good. Before they were on it, when they were younger, they were just like my 6yr old is now and the concerta really helped but the almost seem to have outgrown it, but my 6yr old is out of control and driving me nuts!!!

I may second guess my decisions and I've also become better at planning but it seems following-through with things is where I'm struggling now too.

Anxiety,https://www.drugs.com/answers/tapering-ativan-592730.html,I need help tapering off ativan please?,"I have been to different docotrs with so many different opinions, I would like to hear what perhaps someone who has been through it or very knowledgable of it, thinks I should do. A quick overview of my story: I was on 0.5mg every night to sleep for 3 years. My gp gave it to me, and I never knew it was for anxiety. Yes, my ignorance for trusting him. Then 4 monthes ago I had to see a neurologist for a medical issue. Since I was worried about it, and not sleeping well, he upped my ativan to 1mg per night. Every night. At this time I told him I wanted off the Ativan, not more, and he said""its no big deal taking it, and getting off is only going to complicate things right now"" So I trusted him. Then, after some tests I had done, lots of tests I should say, looking for reason of my illness, turned out it was a thyroid auto immune illness, but no thyroid meds yet due to blood levels are still fine. Anyways, back to the point, As I was taking the ativan at night, it started to panic me instead of relax me... every night. Doctor called it a unusual paradoxyl effect. Well, at this point it was I'm damned if I do , and damend if I don't. The ativan was speeding me out. Tried the alternatives like klonopin, valium, etc... only made things worse. The thing is, I have never had a issue with an anxiety disorder. I simply don't have one. But now, I am getting rebound anxiety from the ativan and they can't up it because it does the opposaite effect, so getting off of it is my only choice. My neurologist wasn't in agreeance with me, so I went to a psychiatrist in help of getting off of it safely. He chose this route. Put me on ativan 1/4 am, 1/4 lunchtime, and 1/4 dinnertime, and then 15mg remeron so i could sleep. Well the remeron made me sleep, but after being on it now 10 days, I am starting to feel so anxious. Even the quartes of ativan are barely helping. I told the doc, and he said  just push through and it will start working. Start working on what? Im not suffering from depression or generalized anxiety disorder. I have ativan withdrawal. He won't LET me get off the Remeron.Well, i am afraid even after 10 days to stop the remeron incase i get withdrawal from that too. I don't know if I could handle withdrawal from ativan and remeron at the same time. Please, my questions are: 1.)should i expect withdrawal symptoms from the remeron? 2.)is it possible the remeron IS causin the anxiety i am now feeling? 3.)HOW do I taper from my current ativan schedule? an 1/8 here and there? please, any help is SO appreciated. thank you!!

Its incredibly helpful, not only in focus, but curbing the impulsive behaviours I have (like spending money, getting involved in projects that make me late for work, etc). I took it for years without the side-effects being much of a problem.  Then, due to a temporary hiccup in my health insurance because of a job change, I had to go a few months without it. I've been trying to get back on it for nearly a year now, but my body isn't taking it as well as before: I get so sick to my stomach! I go through every day I'm on it in total nausea all day long! The nausea is so bad sometimes that all I can do is stay home in bed.  Supposedly if I just stick to it I'll get used to it again, but I can't take it more than 2 or 3 days straight without having to take a break because the stomach problems only compound. I tried reducing the dose, helped reduce the side-effects a little but not a whole lot, but then the effectiveness wasn't there. I'm also concerned with how the Adderall raises my blood pressure. I normally have low blood pressure (ave 90/60, with Adderall 120/68) so I can safely take it, but as I get older (I'm 32 now) I don't know how healthy that is for me. I tried Ritalin when I was first diagnosed back in college and had no real results from it and I didn't like how it made me feel (out-of-it). I like the idea of natural alternatives but they haven't had a whole lot of effectiveness. Has anyone had much luck with any other prescription alternatives that might be easier on the stomach? Of course I'm going to discuss this with my doctor, but I wanted to get some feedback on alternatives from other people before I go in, so I can better decide on an alternative to try. Thank you for your help in this! "

I was on Wellbutrin XL (for depression, body dysmorphic disorder, and binge eating disorder) for about a week and a half before my mom suspected an allergic reaction. Just bad bruising, although I suspect that it is not an allergic reaction at all and instead, just normal bruising. But she told my psychiatrist and he told me that it was medication ""rash"" even though I seriously doubt it. There is no rash. But that's another story. Anyway, it was working really well to control my negative thoughts and my binge eating. I hadn't had that much control over my binge eating in so long and it was great. I lost 5 pounds in that week and a half. As much as I really want to continue Wellbutrin, my mom and my psychiatrist want to switch me to a combination of Belviq and Zoloft.

I've been working 3rd shift all night for the past two years to get my mom out of debt. I am 33 years old and when i got out of the military I decided to see if I have ADHD because I can never read a sentence with out skipping ahead and I can never look people in the eyes. I started this medication Vyvanse a month ago. the first 2 days at 30 mg was like I wish I new about this medciation 15 year ago if it was even around then. anyways heres my point and what I am getting to. 50 mg does make me more aware, self confidence and eye contact when I speak to people the concentration isn't there since the first 2 days of taking this medication. But I am more awake I use to sleep 14 hour days. some poeple have told me that they think I am biopolar and that this medciation might be lifting me into mania again. I don't feel that way because I and my family have said I am more alert since I started this. but why isnt the concentration there? I tink anything past 50mg might raise my blood pressure to un safe readings since it fluxuates now through out the day of 12's ober 87 to 165/100 pulse rate goes from 80 to 122. I think a member named Pledge said soemthing about in which I dont really understand is a adhd medication will let youkno if its workign within those weeks if you have adhd. I am also talking more on this, sometimes to much like I just want to talk or explains things and I htink people are getting annoyed. I use to not say anything, or look people in the eyes so to me I feel like this is helping and I dont want to go back to sleeping all day and being anti-social.  I see my psychiatrist tuesday and plan to tell her this but If I go off a stimulant I will end up sleeping, not being social and also I never got the concentration that I wanted for school this fall to actually learn get good grades and learn my skill. so is it possible the medication might need to be changed to rittalin or adderall because i heard vyvanse to some people just made them talk a lot and be more aware and adderall helped them , but I also heard asking for adderall will make the doctor think your trying to abuse the drug and wil probbaly take everythign away.. I feel kind of lost now, I want to quite my 3 shift job to finish school, this medciation gives me the confidence to strive for better but isnt helping with reading and I feel people think its just triguring biopolar. I also feel my adisor at school took down my name and the Va since I was asking questions about my beneifts had somebody listening. so I am not sure if I acting wierd or hetting paranoid but my mom who lives with me says she hasnt seen a difference in me besides being more alert and talking more.

I feel like I want to be off of it, but i'm scared I might be worse off without it in school and work. It feels like it is controlling me and that it is more of a burden, because most days I take it I feel zoned out, and I feel like it is harder to make friends, and be sociable. I've been on it for my college career and so far haven't made a single friends, as opposed to before adderall, when I felt sociable. when I first started taking it I was extremely social and studious and everything was perfect, but after about a year that went away. Please share with me your input and experiences "

I am a 20 year old female. For a few weeks this past month, I started taking about 60mg of vyvanse a day and drinking about 4 cups of coffee with this. I felt totally fine when I did this. Then, I went out drinking one night with some friends. I did not take vyvanse the day that I went out drinking. I took vyvanse two days after drinking and felt extremely off, like I had a chemical imbalance in my brain. I talked to a pharmacist and they said this is normal because it takes 3 days for alcohol to totally be out of your system before you can take vyvanse again. So, I waited 8 days and drank nothing but water and did not take vyvanse. I tried taking vyvanse one day, and again I felt extremely off. I felt like my brain was twitching inside of my skull and like there was a huge chemical imbalance in my brain. It was more than a headache because I could feel my brain physically hurting and seething.

I'm 20 years old girl, from Europe (from a non English-speaking country so I beg for pardon in advance for the mistakes I'll probably make). I've had anxiety for a quite long time now, almost 5 years, with ups and downs. I've tried to heal with homeopathy, but it helped only for a year circa so last year I decided to go back to my psychiatrist. My doctor is amazing, she really knows what she's doing, also cause she's been through this. Well I was put on sertraline (Zoloft) 50mg for a year, I didn't had a big improvement but the doctor didn't want to change the pill, for she thought it was caused by some school exams I had to do. After these exams my anxiety a lot, so the doctor switched me from Zoloft to Paxil. I take it with Xanax slow release (idk the English word lol). I started taking the Paxil 10mg a day in the morning, xanax and at night Zoloft 25mg (slowly weaning off) till I increased Paxil 20mg in the morning and took off all the Zoloft.  So after 6 days being on Paxil 10mg (+25mg of Zoloft) I started feeling better, had hope and thought ""omg finally the right treatment"" but increasing the dose of Paxil and stopping the Zoloft gave me withdrawals.. Now I'm at day 6 of 20mg of Paxil and I feel nothing but bad.  I have big problems with depersonalization and derealization, that's the worst. Any suggestions?

Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://www.drugs.com/answers/manufacturers-pharmacists-suppliers-dictate-3416815.html,Why do manufacturers / pharmacists / suppliers dictate the prescriptions we are on?,"So I have been ADD ADHD since the 80s, but I hate medication so I have only been on it three times in my life, usually when either a boss urges me to or when I start a new company, lots of changes at once seem to heighten the symptoms and it's overwhelming to me.  I was really happy when my dr. prescribed me the amphetamine salts 10 MGs E111 pill (by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Inc. - I looked up all the information to be as specific as possible) and it instantly worked, I could sit for long periods of time in my chair, focused, my hyper-ness was slowed so I wasn't so sporadic/scattered, I was out of my depression in a week, back to working out, etc. I was relieved as I was reluctant to go on anything, I had been put on strattera in the past and hated it. I only take 5 days a week, then 2 days off, which my Dr said was ok. This was my idea to ensure any issues with substance reliance. I am in perfect health just got a check up, 42, eat healthy, etc. Then after 6 months of being on schedule and feeling like myself again, I started feeling side effects, after a couple weeks of going 'what's wrong with me' I looked at the pill and noticed it looked different. When I asked my Dr he said there are several different generics but it's the same ingredients. It's been two months with two different pills and it really doesn't seem to be working at all. So I pulled out the prescription forms (As the bottles look identical as well as the name), and I see that for the last three months they haven't been giving me what worked. It IS a different pill, they have given me U27 and B972 from TEVA which has not worked at all. I look it up and it shows it's been recalled in 2016? So I do more digging online and I'm appalled, and call the pharmacist - when I ask why a generic is changed without informing a patient or the DR. they said that all generics are the same, but obviously scientifically this cannot be the case, just from a logical standpoint and from the testing you can find online. They said they use whatever their supplier/manufacturer sends them (meaning cheaper I am guessing). They also said C2 Drugs are not highly regulated in NY - meaning manufacturers and pharmacists are not required to allow people to stay on the exact same pill, causing greater side effects. There is the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence, but I can't seem to find the two pills to compare. If we are not able to stay on the exact same drug while in treatment or not even be informed of this it's really alarming.  If I didn't look at the pill names listed on the inside small print of the pamphlet they give me I wouldn't have known, I would have gone back and said the medication wasn't working and he might be giving me a higher dose, which is not needed. The thing is, I just need consistency and to be on the same drug so I can actually evaluate the use accurately. Obviously it's not the same drug, I had such an adverse reaction to it but all other variables were the same. Can anyone else give me any insight into their experiences with the pharmacists changing up their generic pill and the side effects you've had? (The U27 didn't work at all and the B972 made me disoriented, insanely tired, depressed, forgetful, dizzy, nauseous, and spacey). Does anyone have information on why this is legal? C2 drugs are insanely dangerous, so why are they so flippant allowing manufacturers to change it up on us? "

Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://www.drugs.com/answers/struggling-vyvanse-continue-taking-2978945.html,"Struggling with Vyvanse, should I continue taking?","My doctors office is currently closed until Monday but I am having pretty serious issues with my Vyvanse. I will TRY to keep it short from here forward to save time: I have taken Wellbutrin for about 8 years and lexapro for 10 until recently switching to Zoloft. My doctor and I believe that I grew a tolerance to the lexapro over time and that I got a ""bad batch"" of Wellbutrin recently because I reached a point where I had no medication in my system at all. It was awful. Fast forward to Zoloft and a different manufacturer (Global to Par) of Welbutrin and I was much better but still envious of the way I remember feeling years ago after getting sober and allowing my meds to work (about 4 years into the Welbutrin and 6 into lexapro). I had been telling him for years that I struggle to read and have since high school after keeping a 3.8 or better g.p.a. from 1st through 8th grade. My 4 year technical apprenticeship was the height of my struggles to focus and read. I have still struggled since getting sober but did not put it at the top of my list of troubles until recently when I embarrassed myself in front of a meeting with co-workers/ bosses. I continually lost track of our meeting (like always) but this time it was noticed by all.  My doctor had me take a bunch of online tests and then prescribed my Vyvanse 20mg for a week then 40mg for another until our next visit. From day 1 I loved it. It was a touch euphoric and my emotions felt slightly unstable but for the first time in as long as I can remember I could focus! It was awesome. I could actually sit down and read, stay focused on tasks, and was finishing everything I started. I expected the side effects to smooth out. By day 5 I was coping well but around 1pm I felt terribly dizzy and just out of it. Mind you I drink about 400mg of caffeine a day but had only drank maybe 200 that morning. It passed in a few hours and the next day I started the 40mg dose. Bam, focus was even better, I thought this was the new me and from here forward I would be as sharp as I once felt long ago. By the end of the day it sort of faded but there was no ""crash"". Day 2 was much the same. Day 3 I began to feel a very tight chest in the evening that lasted until I fell asleep. I woke on day 4 feeling fine at 4am so I took 40mg and by 6am my chest tightened right back up. That last 1-2 hours and I was a mess to the point that I had to leave work to go home. That was yesterday, today I took only 20 mg and feel irritable/ sad/ happy/ completely unfocused and generally awful at all different points of the day. Luckily my 4 month old son slept long enough for me to write this after making it very difficult for me to read questions/ answers in the Vyvanse support group this morning. Do you guys think I should try taking 40mg until I see my doc on Monday? Do you think I should try a different med like Adderall? I am mentally healthy and am in no harm over here I just feel like crap. Thanks for your help, any advice is good advice "

I am taking 15 mg at bedtime since Mid Sept 2013.  I understand the first person to ask is my doc. My doc told me take 7.5 mg for 1 week and then stop altogether. My pdoc says I can stop quickly as well, he does not think it is helping much for anxiety. However, I do think it has helped my for sleep and also appetite. I tried lexapro and zoloft back in Sept and Nov, both had the typical adverse side effects which would not let up. So I do not take those. I do take either 0.25 mg or 0.5 mg of klonopin during the day. Never more than the 0.5 mg, and that would be split into 2 doses. I was told I have GAD and maybe OCD issues. I do therapy and she is not so sure about the GAD. My anxiety seems to largely stem from 2 or 3 major issues in my life. Work related stress being the main one. The other two are, ironically, issues I never even thought about before my anxiety hit me back in July. I had lost 15 lbs and was not big to begin with. I have gained almost all of that back. So gaining my weight back became an obsession. The other issue is the meds themselves. I am med phobic and have a large degree of anxiety about taking any of these types of meds. However, what I am taking now has helped me to bring the anxiety down to much lower levels. It still flares up once in awhile. My first choice is to manage it with no meds if at all possible.  It is worse during the day if it hits me, hence the reason no one is questioning the use of klonopin (except myself and my constant worry about taking it for too long). My pdoc says klon can be used and he did not seem too worried about the dosage I am on. I was told I could take up to 1.5 mg a day, I have never done more than 0.5 mg a day.  Anyway, the last time I attempted to stop remeron was when i first started lexapro. The pdoc said my reactions were due to the lexapro. He discounted me having any problems stopping the remeron. I should say I am thinking about stopping the remeron and do not plan to do it before I speak with him in a couple of weeks. But given what he has told me in the past, I am thinking he will recommend a quick taper. What I do not want to do is stop too quickly, I have time to take it slow and make sure the effects of stopping the remeron are minimized. thanks "

Anxiety,https://www.drugs.com/answers/anyone-experience-weaning-zoloft-2682450.html,Anyone with experience weaning off of zoloft?,"Here's my story, being as brief as possible. I began taking zoloft in September 2014, just 25mg. I increased to 50 after 2 weeks and basically felt my anxiety slightly increase (I've come to find out that I should'nt have even been on zoloft as its not really for anxiety?). I was mainly nauseous and nervous most of the time. I thought I just needed more medicine, so decided to increase to 75mg in January. My anxiety increased so I went to 100mg. After 7-10 days of 100, I felt like a zombie. Some awful crying spells, fatigued, headaches... nothing like I had previously experienced. I decided that the zoloft didn't work well with me so I'm currently weaning off of it before switching to Lexapro. For the last two weeks since I began weaning (went from the 100mg to 62.5mg for a week and now currently on 50mg for last 5 days), I've had this dull, lingering headache that doesn't go away. It's in the back of my head and I feel somewhat dizzy and disoriented as well. However, I haven't felt too nervous nor anxious oddly enough, but pretty lethargic and weird. Is this all fairly typical for being on zoloft for about 6 months. How long would anyone expect to feel this way? It's not a very a high dosage nor long period of time so I'm a little concerned. I was at my doctor on Wednesday to discuss the switch and my symptoms and he didn't seem concerned at all. I also asked for an EKG (which was normal) and he asked ""why do you think you had a cardiac event??? "". I guess he doesn't know how us anxious people operate lol.

I’ve been thinking maybe my B12 was low because of my symptoms- tinnitus, unbalanced feeling, tingly nerve pains, itchy legs etc... which can also be chalked up to anxiety. But since I’ve started using B12 500 mgs under tongue it feels like my lexapro has completely stopped working - And it wasn’t working that great to begin with! Has anyone else had this happen?  It concerns me because I found this  online  - Different research studies and Doctor’s suggestion have figured out that the use of Lexapro and Vitamin B12 containing foods has no significant interaction; therefore, you can eat a moderate amount of Vitamin B12 containing foods while taking Lexapro. However, Food and Drug Administration authority has found that there is a risk for significant drug interaction when Lexapro is taken with Vitamin B12 supplements. So you cannot take Vitamin B12 supplements with Lexapro however Vitamin B12 containing foods can be eaten. "

Second day after taking it, I became more?","... nauseous and had diarrhea. Called my doc, she says to lower it down to 5 mg once a day. Problem is, she also had me quit remeron at the same time. Within one week, I have gone from taking 30 mg remeron at night, to not taking any at all this evening. i have been on remeron since 7/29 at varying dosages. started at 7.5mg, then 15 mg, 22.5 mg, and was on 30 mg for 18 days. doc did not think it was workng. my anxiety seemed to be getting worse while on it.  BTW I have been told I have GAD. Anxiety is my #1 issue. Depression not so much. My therapist says anxiety is my main problem.  So right now, I am not sure what is causing my nausea and diarrhea. Stopping the remeron too quickly? Or starting the lexapro? Or could it be the two don't mix?  I have other meds in the mix too, but not sure they are the problem. Doc gave me ambien to take back on 7/25. I was wary of it and have been tapering that down to where I only took 2.5 mg a night, then even less for a few days. I stopped it last week altogether.  I do take a unisom type pill to help sleep, doxylamine (benadryl gets me wired). I always used to take that before my bout with anxiety began in mid july. yes i do have anxiety, probably always did. but its been so much worse these past 2 months after a health scare. things turned out ok, but anxiety took hold and has not let go. as i say, i am in therapy for that.  Doc says to take the 5 mg lexapro for a week, see if I feel better. I would assume by that time the remeron would be out of my system. So if I still felt odd, lexapro would likely be the reason. But she also said to stop the lexapro if I do not feel better, and to go find a psychiatrist (no referral).  She did give me 0.5 klonopin which was supposed to help with the start up with the lexapro. She also said it would help me to sleep? I understand it calms you. But I was not so sure I wanted to stop ambien only to start klonopin for sleep. Regardless, I only take the klonopin during the day. I asked if nausea and diarrhea were common when starting lexapro, but my doc did not seem to know. Truth is, that is the reason I called her office as I have been told both remeron and lexapro are ""easy"" meds in terms of side  effects. I figured if they could tell me one way or the other than I could try and weather through the side effects. I guess am looking for anyone who might take lexapro and if these side effects were common in the beginning. Also, anyone who might have stopped remeron and if these side effects are common for that. One thing, I am extremely med phobic. I am my own worst enemy with anxiety and taking these type of meds. Prior to the end of July, I took a unisom pill for sleep and that is all I ever took in my life. Thanks "

I looked up other people's experiences to see if those were common side effects, and then saw people talking about how it made them gain a lot of weight. I'm 5' tall and about 95 lbs, and have never had any problems with weight before but just in case I made sure to start exercising more/longer (both cardio and muscle toning type stuff), cut down on sugar (and some other things in general, like mayonnaise), and if I needed to have a snack I've made sure it's something like carrots, nuts, or fruit. Despite that I might've gained like 1 pound, which that part really isn't a big deal, the part I'm worried about is that I've always had a toned stomach with barely any fat there at all and now there's this layer there. I've even been almost 10 pounds heavier before and never had that, so I'm kind of freaking out like what's going on and where is it coming from. It's one thing when your body changes gradually over time, but the idea that something can change it practically overnight and the thought of what if this is permanent is giving me some serious anxiety. So I'm pretty sure I've been off it for about a month, so I guess it's not like I've given it that much time, but I'm just really worried about what to expect. Do I just need to wait longer for the drug to get out of my system? Or is it probably out of my system and my metabolism or whatever it is just needs some time to go back to normal? Is this likely a permanent change even though I've only been on it a month? Or is it just going to be really hard to lose it and I need to start doing some really intense exercising and diet changes? Also, since I'm guessing these things would make a difference, I'll mention I'm 28 and have never had kids. Any insight, advice, whatever would be helpful, thanks. "

My anxiety is very physical and I experience committing, dry reching, body shakes, complete loss of appetite, nausea and tension in my jaw, throat and chest.

I didn’t have an issue reducing the clonazepam however 2 weeks after I stopped clonazepam my anxiety came back just as hard as it was before meds.  I went to my doc and she told me to go back on clonazepam. I am feeling a bit better now but still experience some strong anxiety systems. I went back again to the doc a week later and she thought it was time to increase dose from 10mg to 20mg. I suggested i do 15g first.  I guess I am just wondering what others think.

This is my third time on Cipralex. My first time was 8 years ago when I had my first bad anxiety bout. My anxiety always goes to fatal diseases and obviously i have one (thats what I think when i get into this mood). Long story short I have been tested for everything and comes back as normal. What I always find fascinating is the symptoms feel so real. I have a had night sweats, twitching, heart burn, thin stools, indigestion, headaches. You name it if Webmd said it went to a fatal disease I would have a minor issue that would blow up into all the symptoms. Anyways the reason I am writing is because I went on cipralex again 4 weeks ago and I wanted to quit. It was the hardest to get onto. I had heartburn, nausea, unable to swallow and bad indigestion. So instead of knowing in my heart of hearts that this is just the pill - I think stomach or esophagus cancer. Of course I made my doctor (after he reluctantly agreed) to get me a an endoscopy. As it turns out I am all good - I know shocker to the outside world! Its just crazy to me how real the symptoms feel. I am hoping that they will go away now - since I now know that I am not dying from them but - wow the mind is strong and the symptoms are too!

My anxiety is worse in the morning if I am having a bad day but can also be bad when I am tired or towards the end of a long day. From what I have read about this condition this is the norm. I am now menopausal where initially the anxiety got worse but seems to have settled down a bit thanks to medication adjustments. Lexapro has really helped me through menopause ameliorating the hot flushes and night sweats. A question to the female anxiety sufferers on this forum, does anxiety go away or become less severe post menopause?

I have been wanting to make a job change for some time but held off.  I was using the Ativan as a means to combat anxiety and stress. I managed to taper my dose down to 0.5mg or 0.25 mg per day - some days were even only 0.125mg per day come February and March but was not able to completely come off of it. I was up and down in my doses. There was the odd day that I would take any where from 1 to 2 mgs if there were more stressful situations.  The past 4-6 weeks, I was also using 5mg of Zopiclone at night to sleep. I have been off work the past few days and have a doctors note to be off for another week as my energy levels, appetite and anxiety were increasing. Since being off, I have switched to Valium 1-2 mgs per day. Has been 5 days today and I feel like CRAP!! Two nights ago I didn't sleep at all.

I did that for 2 days and did not feel relief, so my doc said I could up the xanax to two .25mg tablets 3 times a day for a total of 1.5mg per day. I ended up settling on 1.25 mg per day and did that for 5 days. Then I successfully decreased to .875mg for the past 3 days. I would now like to start tapering off of the xanax even more, as I do not want to be dependent on this drug. I also do not have any refills left and hope that the SSRI (Zoloft) will start taking effect soon. My question is: since I have only been on xanax for less than two weeks, do I still need to taper off rather slowly, or can I safely taper by .25mg every couple of days? Any insight would be helpful, and I can provide more information if needed. Thank you! "

I've been taking extremely small doses (0.5-1mg) of the Ativan at night in order to sleep and not feel those lingering anxiety feelings, but it doesn't seem to help besides making me drowsy, and even then it seems to be prolonging my symptoms. The drowsiness has also lingered into the next day following taking the Ativan and its causing unpleasant head fog/slowness and general zombieness. As this seems to be a temporary state of anxiety, should I continue to take it, should I quit it altogether and find something over the counter and not as heavy, or should I just forget medication and deal with this through all of the other hollistic treatment?

My difficult time was behind me and I started to reduce my dosage from 25 mg  September- -20 mg,  October -15 mg  November -10 mg  December 5 mg  January 0 mg  During this time I was feeling really good.  15 February- strange two nights came. When i was falling asleep I got depressive and anxiety feelings, like somebody suddenly put virus to my mind program. I didn't sleep, next night I took 25 mg trazadoneand I slept well, this disappeared for one month.  14 march- the same strange nights came. I took trazadone again but this time it was adverse reaction.  19 march- doctor said to increase trazadone- I did to 100 mg- it was still opposite reaction i was stimulated, not sleepy.  One week later reinstated paroxetine- adverse reaction- with every dosage I was feeling worse, even Klonopin what i got for short time was working differently. I believe I became sensitive for any drags, so withdrawal symptoms started. It is 4 months after. I tapper slowly paroxetine- 3 mg 21 days, 1,5 mg 21 days, 0,74 day. From one week they added Klonopin 0,25 x3 a day to deal with WD, and i slow tapper because I could stabilize on drag. How long it can last this mental and physical WD?
