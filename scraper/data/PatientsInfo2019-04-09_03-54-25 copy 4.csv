Nail Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/white-vertical-line-on-big-toe-nail-206548,White vertical line on big toe nail,"I wonder if anyone can shed any light on this. I have a white line, around 0.5mm wide running straight down my big toe nail. I can't remember how long I have had this. I've been to doc who are waiting for lab tests to see if its fungal related - the first tests have come back abnormal and are doing further tests. My toe does not hurt and the nail is OK apart from the white line, but my big toe is very slightly red at top and underneath. I've done research on this and cannot find anything concrete. So, question is, what does abnormal mean in tests, and what is this white line. Thank you. 1 like, 8 replies "

Nail Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/fungal-nail-669644,fungal nail ,"Hello, I have had what looks like a fungal infected nail for over a year now, never really bothered me but think comes from getting damaged during playing football and then developing from there.  Recently the other big toenail has seemed to develop fungus. firstly, do the images look like nail fungus?  Secondly, is it recommended to cut away the section of nail that is infected? For example the new issue in the toenail is only ever slightly along the top and I could probably cut it away.  I have got my hands on some of the nail varnish type medication that I am going to start but was wondering whether trimming them back and exposing the skin would help first before applying the solution??  How spreadable is nail fungus? Can I spread it through sharing the bed with my partner? Or the shower? thanks 0 likes, 1 reply "

I remember taking the armour and felt a zing though my body - not a good zing.  I tried it a for a few days and couldn't take it anymore so she put me back on levothyroxine and upped me to .50mcg.  When I took it remember not feeling right - I checked the labels and it was exactly what I was taking before, just a little stronger dose.  I shrugged it off figuring it was all in my head.  A year later I saw my primary doctor at a physical and I was complaining of body aches and pains - I felt like I had   but wasn't swollen.  She sent me to all different doctors to check for arthritis, lupus, ms, bone problems, and (thankfully) everything checked out ok.  The only thing that showed up was a high ANA and thyroid antibodies which were pretty high.  A couple of months later I had sever muscle pain that started in my arms (could not even lift a case of water) then after 2 or 3 months it just went away and it then happened in my legs (couldn't get up from a sitting position and had a very difficult time walking) - again lasted 2 or 3 months and then just disappeared(thankfully)  just as fast as it appeared.  I decided to see an endocrinologist.  He told me the pains were not thyroid related.  He upped my dose and changed me to synthroid.  Life went on as usual - next visit he upped me again.  Funny thing is I never felt any difference when taking these thyroid meds - because I never started them because I felt bad just a high tsh. At my last appointment  he asked how I was feeling I told him ok - I just have the fibromilagia pains.(no one every actually diagnosed me as I kept getting passed around from doctor to doctor with a ""you're fine"" pat on the back)  My tsh level was a little high so he upped my dose.  I took my first dose and by the end of the night I was very achey. I continued for 2 days and by the 3rd day I couldn't get out off bed.   I decided to try not taking the medication and after 2 days I felt so much better.  I asked to switch to tirosint (thinking it was the fillers)   I just tried that and the exact same thing happened...I couldn't move .  I gave it three days and then I stopped.  I have now been off it for 3 days and I once again feel much better.  Not 100% but much better - enough to know that it is the levothyroxine that is causing my aches) I feel like I was poisoning myself all these years and I can't help but wonder if I caused my thyroid antibodies to kick in because it didn't want the levothyroxine.   Has anyone else had problems with levothyroxine?  What did you end up doing to make yourself better?  0 likes, 10 replies "

Levothyroxine Sodium,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/misdiagnosed-hypothyroid-taking-levothyroxine-672483,Misdiagnosed hypothyroid & taking Levothyroxine,"2 months ago I was going through a lot of life changes. I am also on a vegan diet.  I was having weird episodes where I would have this throbbing   which lead to a tingling in my chest and then hard to breathe. It would keep me from sleeping at night and make me extremely anxious. After many nights of this I went to after care and they said I had a low heart rate (resting HR of 43) and sent me to the ER. At the ER they said they couldn’t find anything abnormal with any of my tests including multiple EKGs. The doctor diagnosed me with migraines. He said my TSH was a little off (tsh of 6) but my free t4 was normal so it was nothing to worry about). I had a follow up with my primary doctor who was convinced that it was hypothyroid because of my extreme fatigue following these episodes. She put me on 50 mcg of levothyroxine. My first day of the levothyroxine I had a panic attack that was the worst I ever had - it made my whole body go numb and I was shaking like crazy and my heart rate was over 100. Soon after this she put me on fluoxetine for my   (20 mg). After a horrid week of both medicines I was having horrible panic attacks including waking up in the middle of the night and sitting for hours scared to go back to sleep, labored breathing, confusion and depersonalization, dizzy and lightheaded, and extreme thirst. I stopped the fluoxetine after 6 days due to many hospital visits where they have said nothing was wrong. My labs in between this time said that my tsh was at a normal level (this being before the medicine could even get into my system- it had only been a week). I have now been on levothyroxine for 3 weeks and have had extreme anxiousness, excessive thirst (drinking over a gallon of water a day) and insomnia and restlessness. I went back to my doctor and she took me off of the levothyroxine to see if my labs would stay consistent and normal since there was so much fluctuation the past 4 weeks. Does anyone have any advice/experiences like this where they may have been misdiagnosed and taken levothyroxine? Have you had side effects like this to this medicine? Any insight would be very helpful! 0 likes, 5 replies "

At the time I was put on a very low dosage of Levothyroxine. It has been increased a couple of times but I am still only taking .088 MG. 4 years ago I started having horrible bilateral foot pain. It feels like I have lots of little broken bones in my feet. Recently the pain has moved to my Achilles, ankle and lower calf. Initially I went to see an orthopedist who felt like I had a metabolic bone disease. I have seen 3 different endocrinologists, one of which was part of a week long stay at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN trying to get some answers. I have been to 2 podiatrists, 2 additional orthopedists, a pain management doctor, an accupuncturist, a holistic doctor and reflexologist. I have had a few stress fractures in my feet during the 4 years but not the entire time. I do not have any now. The main thing I have been told is that I have osteoporosis but osteoporosis does not cause pain. I have done everything that I have been told to do concerning the osteoporosis. I did daily injections of Forteo for 2 years and take Calcium supplements. The reflexologist/massage therapist has helped me get to the point that I can somewhat function but the pain is still there and if I am on my feet too much, it gets bad. I have always been very active so this has caused a drastic lifestyle change. I am 62 but feel 90.

Here are the details. I am on 175mcg of levothyroxine. I hadn't got any 25mcg tablets to hand so I used 100mcg tablets and chopped them up to use one x 100mcg and three quarters x 100mcg. I followed the guidance and took the tablet in the morning (having not eaten anything since 7pm the previous night), an hour before breakfast. Within a few moments, my tongue felt sore (like I'd burnt it) and I had a metallic taste in my mouth. A few minutes later I started  . These are the typical reactions I get when I have eaten a food I am intolerant to. The patient information leaflet with each set of tablets gives the following information (I have highlighted the differences in bold). The tablets by MercuryPharm contain: 25mcg anhydrous levothyroxine sodium,  , lactose, maize starch,  , magnesium stearate and purified water. The tablets by Wockhardt contain: 25mcg anhydrous levothyroxine sodium, lactose,  (fine powder), maize starch, magnesium stearate. I react to one manufacturer's tablets much more than the other manufacturer's. How each person will react is particular to them. I thought I would just highlight to everyone that there are differences and if one brand doesn't suit you, it is worth trying another. I have suspected for a long time that I was reacting to my levothyroxine medication and thought it was due to the lactose in it - I'm intolerant to milk. It may still be so, but the maize starch could also be a problem as I have a histamine intolerance and need to avoid all grains. I even asked my doctor for an alternative levothyroxine that didn't contain lactose. The only one he is able to prescribe is liquid thyroxine, but at £100 a bottle it is, understandably, only prescribed to people with a bad milk allergy. I didn't qualify as my intolerance doesn't show up on the RAST test (a notoriously unreliable test for  ). My cow's milk RAST test (Xalc9) result was 0.3 (range kUA/L 0 – 0.34) - though it should have registered zero as I had not had any milk for 4 months. I stopped having milk in my diet in February 2015 because I got a rash and blotchy itchy   came up on my arms – the doctor saw these and referred me to an immunologist. I am still waiting for the appointment. In the meantime I am researching doctors who will prescribe NDT. See UK website Thyroid Patient Advocacy. 2 likes, 10 replies "

Lichen Planus,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/recently-diagnosed-with-lichen-planopilaris-scalp--567807,Recently Diagnosed with Lichen Planopilaris (scalp),"Hello all.  I'm a 30 year old male hoping to gain some valuable knowledge and insight from this community, as it's been a major struggle dealing with this disorder. I've been fighting with the following symptons on my scalp for ~2 years now: red, inflammed skin,  , mild itching but nothing terrible, and noticeable hairloss in the affected areas. The areas affected are my frontal third, two thirds, crown and also my right side above my ear. There are still areas of my scalp that are unaffected and retain a proper neutral color. I previoulsy have never had this issue on my scalp before and there are no signs of it anywhere else on my body.  After visiting 3 different dermatologist, I finally had a scalp biopsy performed.  The results were that I had lichen planopilaris of the scalp. My previous two dermatologist were treating it as possibly seborrheic dermatitis.  I never quire agreed with this though as I did not have the typical signs of SD: dandruff, flakes, scale, etc--just persistent redness and inflammation.  Even so, I tried every known dandruff shampoo and active ingredient available on the market to no avail. In fact, these generally just exacerbated the condition. So far I'm been put on the following meds: --Minocycline (bacterial) --Clobetasol (corticosteroid) --Fluconazole (Fungal) --and my most recent derm wants me to start on immunusuppresants CellCept and Plaquenil In terms of natural remedies, I've tried applying pure aloe veral gel, coconut oil, avocado oil, apple cidar vinegar...None of these really have done anything for me, sadly. The Clobetasol topical liquid does   help.  It seems to improve the areas least affected and brings my skin tone back to almost normalcy, but has little affect on the more pronounced zones. I also have reservations on being stuck using a steroid for my entire life for two reasons: 1. it's detrimental to the skin (thinning). 2. It's not treating the cause but seemingly only the symptom. As of right now, I'm working on making some dietary changes (no dairy) and more of a ""paleo diet"" regemin.  I have not yet tried the immunos as I've very hesitant to go down that route. My current derm states I need a baseline eye exam before starting up on these drugs.  Quite intimidating.   I've heard a number of people report very good progress from holistic methods, such as Oriental medicine coupled with acupunture.  Wondering if anyone can comment on this? I'm very much so at an impasse with this skin disorder. It has come out of nowhere and totally taken control of my scalp's health, and, well, my entire life to a large degree. It's extremely draining and does not allow you to focus on other parts of your day-to-day living; Instead, you're looking for ""the next treatment of the week to try out on your scalp"" hoping that you can finally get some relief.   Thank you to those who read my post and looked at my photos attached.  I value any input user's here might provide to help me fight this terrible skin disease off. 0 likes, 83 replies "

So I read up on it and it says it will clear up the rash.  I bought some. It is not fast. I wish it was faster. It took about 6 weeks before my rash was flat, but I still have all the discolorations, they are starting to fade, but I have been using the cream for months now. It soothed the itch within a day or two.  I had another flare, but in a different place, and I put the cream on it as soon as I saw it, and it stopped it! That was really cool. Maybe it works better on new rash then on rash that has been on you a while. I will certainly keep buying it and using it for the rash and itch, just wish it cleared up the spots more.

I now believe I have this in my mouth. I noticed that my gums were quite sore when brushing my teeth. When I look in my mouth my gums are reddened in areas with a white sort of covering on them in places. This is especially significant over where I have crowns. I am going to my GP this afternoon, but I realise he may not know, and I might have to see a specialist, which may mean a  . I also suffer from health anxiety at times, and this is very severe atm. In the meantime I have had a call from my GPs surgery to go in for   for Hypothyroidism and Vitamin B 12 deficiency as a routine ordered by the Dermatologist,  because LP can be linked to these issues. When I google anything I always feel worse and wonder if anybody has had OLP on their gums. The rest of the mouth seems OK atm. Many thanks 0 likes, 11 replies "

The ast and alt were only a few points high and I was told it was because I had fatty liver due to diabetes.  Sometimes high sometimes normal... Then I changed PCP and found they went higher.  ALT up to 300.  Then I ended up in ER for a different reason and alt went to 500 and ast to 900.  The ER doctor thought I had binged on alcohol for the weekend which I had not but he did not believe me.  I went to my GI PA who also assumed I was drinking way to much.  They did a full autoimmune panel and I tested positive on Antibody 2h.  I had tested positive on that a year before and no one seemed to care.  I have continued to have slightly elevated alt or ast with an elevated ALP. Sometimes the alt is high, sometimes the alt is high.  There is no pattern   Lately the ast and alt have been normal with an elevated alp.  Ultrasound is normal (I've lost 50 ponds maybe that is why I don't have a fatty liver), CT is normal.  Oh yea, 5 years ago I started out with insane itching.  But I have hypothyroidism and it was said due to that.  I also have had fatigue since I was a child but it became much worse in the last 8 years.  I have type 1 diabetes since 1994 .  Im' 63.  They also told me Diabetes made me fatigued.  Hypothyroidism fatigued. Fibromyalgia  fatigued.  I had shingles and I never felt I came out of the fatigue.  They want a liver biopsy.  Isn't this enough, 3 blood profiles with elevated ALP.  Bilirubin normal. If the fatigue can be helped and perhaps the disease can be slowed I thin they should giveit to me to see how I respond. I do NOT want a liver biopsy.

I think I've probably got VLP & OLP.  For 3-4 months I've felt a bit of itch/irritation when washing down below, but didn't think much of it, and it seemed to improve. I'm 35 and not currently in a sexual relationship. Anyhow, I had a look with a mirror the other day and found two vulval lesions, one each side. One is very small and just inside labia majora, and on the other side its a bigger area, extending from labia minora outwards towards labia majora. Both lesions are kind of lilac/white colour, and I cant see any erosions. GP didn't seem too worried but suggested gynae assessment, and prescribed betamethasone cream. I'm seeing a gynae next week. I was worried about VIN but all smears have been clear, and GP said it might be LP. I've now looked in my mouth and can see white lacy patches inside both cheeks, mainly by my back teeth, but again no erosions and it isn't painful. The vulval lesions aren't sore, although with hindsight it does burn if I pee right after having a shower. The more I read about LP, the more terrified I am! Given the oral lesions, I'm guessing this will be the diagnosis, and I have been going  through a period of stress. I am wondering if it's possible to have a mild or non-erosive form of OLP/VLP? From what I can see, no erosions or loss of structures at the moment. Thanks in advance for any advice or support. Feel so alone and scared! 0 likes, 11 replies "

I liked to drink for several years.. but would not consider myself an alcoholic.  I did not drink at all during the week due to my job, however on Friday and Saturday nights I would have 6 to 12 beers at a time each night... sometimes I go weeks without drinking, other times I was consecutive with drinking on weekends.  last year in September I went on a trip to an exautic island and drank for a week straight,  when I got home, days later , I had upper right abdominal pain and felt like crap, to the point I went to the ER.. I told them I had drank all week the week prior and after some googling was worried I had damaged my liver...  after blood tests,  a contrast ct scan, and ultrasound,  on my liver and pancreas ,I was told I had 2 small gallstones and my cholesterol was 10 points higher then it should be, and my white and red cell counts were off... but otherwise I was fine and sent to have a referral done for my gallbladder.  I again brought up my drinking to the general surgeon,  and he said my liver looked great and to relax .. I was over thinking things and drinking at my age would not cause permanent liver damage. I had continued to drink for 12 months but cut down a LOT.. every couple of weeks Id have a few beers,  6 to 12, but I still get right upper pain the day after, very subtle... almost feels like a pulled muscle.

Liver Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/liver-problem-679783,Liver problem ,"Hi all. I’ve posted a couple of times about this subject and I’m grateful for the advice. I’m at the docs on the 2nd October as I’m just not happy regarding my liver progress.  I’ve been told to ‘enjoy life’ and not be scared to death and depressed with worry about drinking alcohol and eating the nicer richer foods out there. I’ve been cautious however. I used to drink daily and eat fatty foods and rightly so, diagnosed with fatty liver disease.  I have been good since my diagnosis in late June eating wholemeal foods, veg, fruit etc etc etc. I’ve sustained a weight loss of nearly 1 1/2 stone but I have taken the docs advice and have enjoyed life so I’ve had a drink on a Saturday. Going from 7 days to 1 sometimes 2 is a vast improvement. The NHS website no less does state that if you abstain from alcohol with ARFLD for 2 weeks then your liver should return to normal health. I do find this quite unrealistic if I’m honest. My overall health appears to be ok. No pain, no  , stool still pail but healthy ( I put that down to change in diet) but I am getting discomfort around my right rib cage. I must stress, this is not pain. I just feel as though I’m bruised. It’s more that sensation possibly with a very mild back ache type feeling. I did have an injury almost at the dime time as my diagnosis. It was a sporting impact injury. An elbow to that side of the body which was very painful. I can feel the bruised rib when I press. This is almost to the side under the bottom rib but the same sort of feeling is radiating to the back. It makes me want to press up against something to massage the pressure point. It’s not pain but I can feel it. I know it’s there. I’m just worried that this is my liver. I’m worried it’s inflamed and that’s what I can feel. I’m thinking my once a week drink is still continuing to do me harm. What is the pain felt when you have a poorly liver? Would I feel unwell at the same time? This is why I’m taking myself off to the docs as it’s bothering me and if I’m honest, it’s really getting me down. This feeling just doesn’t feel muscular. I hope I’m wrong and I know some muscle groups can feel odd when damaged through injury but I’m thinking my liver is just not coping with life. The doc never said to me that I should be T total forever and that I needed to go on a strict diet continuously so I haven’t but if I need to then I should be told. I really want an   but I’m not hopeful I’m going to get one. This should tell me if it’s my liver, skeletal or muscular.  I’m beginning to regret my nieveness and abuse to alcohol in the past. I’m 41 and have been drinking since 18 and heavily for 5 yrs and I’m scared I’ve knackered myself up.  Any reassurance or real life stories would really help.

I have been having a number of symptoms for a while now and now I'm thinking it may be possible i have a liver problem. About 4 days ago my both of my hands felt sore while driving. Later that night while washing my face I noticed the outside of my hands on the side had redness so I turned them over and noticed they both palms were red. Under my thumb, little ringer and at the pads under each finger. The redness is also on some of my actual fingers. I went on Google images and typed on red rash on palms and from the photos I seen what I had was called Palmer erythema. I had a dermatologist appt the next day for a cyst on my back and showed him my hands. He confirmed it's what it is. I also pointed out to him some other skin issues that had recently popped up. He said I had spider nevi, something that begins with a T but is all these little veins around my nose, under it and around my mouth and liver spots. I forgot to show him my nails but I wanted him to look at them. He said I needed to go to my primary for some blood work. I have an appt but went on line to look up causes of the skin issues and liver problems is all that keeps popping up and the list of symptoms in addition to the skin ones are symptoms I have been having lately. I had basic labs start of May which included some kind of liver function test cause I recall my Dr telling me my kidneys and liver were good from the blood work. I also had a   of my abdomen w/o contrast for a mass he thought he felt. The report says my liver looks okay other then being enlarged by 20cm which he thinks is something called Riedels lobe and nothing to worry about. The report also says the lack of contrast limits pathology in  the solid organs which the liver is one of them. I am not even sure you can see liver disease with a ct scan anyways.

Lichen Sclerosus,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/ls-around-the-anus-694117,LS around the anus,"Hi, I've had LS for 9 years and it has been well-controlled with betnovate a couple of times a week and cetra Ben every day. But now I think I have around the anus, very sore and the doctor I saw said there was a small split, which accounted for the bit of bleeding. I also have a history of colitis and I had thought that was the problem though it wasn't typical. She told me to use haemorrhoid cream! But they all have lanolin in which I'm allergic to, so I have just been using vase line, which doesn't really help. Then I had a light bulb moment and realised it is probably the LS appearing in a new place. I had stopped using the betnovate recently as I'd had no vulval itching and thought I'd give it a rest. My question is does anyone else suffer LS in this area and how do they deal with it? Going to the loo is a nightmare and leaves me very sore. Chris 0 likes, 9 replies "

Liver Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/mixed-matched-lab-results-and-no-input-from-doctor-asking-for-help--696427,Mixed-matched lab results and no input from doctor. ASking for help.,"I've gotten a grab bag of lab results in my journey so far, and my primary care doctor has not called me back to go over my labs, which is causing  intense  . I'm hoping some of you may have some advice to get me through until I have an appointment. I was a heavy drinker for many, many years. I noticed I was getting fat and some abdominal  bloating, but I assumed that was all due to the  . I've also been itchy,  which I assumed is because I moved to a new climate. Well, in February I went to the gynecologist, and she randomly ordered a liver function test and some general lab work. My ALT is the only liver enzyme that is high, at 69, but my cholesterol levels are high and my triglycerides are REAL high at 444. I've had a ultrasound, which showed an enlarged liver at 13 cm. It’s also fatty, and has an enlarged primary bile duct. On the gallbladder end, I have an enlarged duct and the organ is ""fully dissented."" No gallstones or bile though. Immediately quit drinking, and picked up a healthy diet. I started taking milk thistle, Vitamin B supplements, probiotics, turmeric, and a daily multivitamin. I lost 15 pounds. After a week, I felt much, much better. But, after the ultrasound things took a turn. I have a lot of general pain in my abdomen. It started on the right side below my ribs, and there was some pain on the left side as well. I feel pressure in my abdomen. Wearing stretchy leggings even causes discomfort, which is alarming. Now, my upper mid-abdomen also hurts and there is pain in my lower center back. My kidneys looked normal on the ultrasound, so I’m hoping this is from the effort to sit up straight to take pressure off my organs. I’ve lost appetite, and am basically eating because I know I need to, but I’m constantly nauseous. Eating small meals is better than nothing, but it takes real effort, and my gag reflex wants to bring the food back up. The other big concern has to do with my menstrual cycle. I’m on long-term birth control, so I have not had a period in about two years. Since all this started, I have had two periods in one month. My gynecologist says that the birth control itself doesn’t cause liver problems, but having liver issues and being on birth control can increase my odds for  . Also, apparently the liver regulates bleeding. Terrifying. I wish my primary doctor would call me back, but in lieu of that, have any of you experienced these things? I think the sonogram would show  , but I’m not sure how concerned I should be or how treatable any of this is. Can an enlarged liver return to a normal size after following a sustained healthy diet? And how do we fix the bile duct issues? Any input would be appreciated. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I continued to try and carry on as normal, working and renovating my house. A mouth passed and i started having chest pains and tightness cold like symptoms and lost 2 stone. so I visited the doctors, i had a blood test on my liver and found high billirubin so was put on a waiting list to see a  Hepatologist in three months! After another month passed i started getting extreme headaches my knee so so stiff and saw my head felt like it was going to explode i had ringing in ears and flashes of light whist my eyes where closed and i started having muscle twitching all over my mostly my neck i had a weak jaw and neck felt like it couldn’t hold the wait of my head. I got fast tracked to oncology where there ran a pet   from knees to my neck and a mri on my head. The only thing they found was my thymus was enlarged.

Liver Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/liver-pain-i-do-not-know-what-disease-is-this-698401,Liver pain - I do not know what disease is this,"Hi there, I have a problem with the liver and I do not know what disease is that. Let me explain how all started. In the winter of 2017-2018 (1 year and half ago) I had a lot of problems respiratory tract infections (pneumonia, bronchitis and colds) and I took several rounds of antibiotics (2nd generation cephalosporins and levofloxacin) and several other medicines (like ibuprofen - not too much - maybe 1 pill of 200mg at 3 days) and many herbs. Then in March 2018 I’ve had bacterial prostatitis and I had to take 1 month of levofloxacin. Also, my GP gave me indomethacin (for several days) so that I can urinate better. Needless to say, indomethacin din not improved the condition... All have passed, and I did not had any respiratory problems nor prostatitis in the past 11 months. In April 2018 I have discovered a good salmon in our neighbourhood store and I have started to eat a lot of it (about 2-300 grams) every day. Unfortunately, I cooked it by frying in oil. After 1 month I develop gastritis (probably my stomach was weakened from Ibuprofen and too much fried oil has raised the acid too much …). I started to take Pantoprazole for 3 weeks and Sucralfate. The stomach pain has reduced significantly, but not entirely. I took a break from PPI … and after 2 weeks the stomach started to hurt again. I tried some herbal medicine, with no significant effect. In August 2018 I started to take Ranitidine (150mg in the evening), because I read that PPI have too many side effects. After 5 weeks of ranitidine, I started to have a very strong pain in the right side of the abdomen where the liver is located. No other symptoms, just the pain. I stopped Ranitidine, and the pain has disappeared. After 1 week, I resume Pantoprazole (because the gastritis was still there). After 1 month of Pantoprazole, I again had strong pain in the liver area. I stopped the Pantoprazole and the pain has disappeared. Also, the stomach condition has improved significantly. In November 2018, I was ok. I followed a simple diet: potatoes, carrot, chicken breast, banana. I December I said that I’m cured and I can eat anything what I want. Bad mistake, after 3 days the stomach pain was again present. During this time, I have lost weight (about 9 kg in the last year) so I started to eat white chocolate to gain weight again. After 3 days of white chocolate [200g per day] the strong liver pain was again there. The pain was more severe if I bend forward. It felt like I had a wound there. At the end of December I went to a lab of to do some blood test for liver. The values have been: Gamma GT = 93 (normal interval [0-55]) ALT = 70 (normal interval [0-45]) AST = 35 (normal interval [0-35]). My GP was on vacation, so I had to research more by myself. I took silymarin (150mg/ day - not very constant) since August 2018, but with not too much effect. After the first blood test I started to take Quercetin. The pain has disappeared very fast. After 1 week of 3x 500 mg of Quercetin, the pain in the liver area was almost nonexistent. I repeated the blood test after 1 week, this time with more parameters: Gamma GT = 124 (normal interval [0-55]) ALT = 82 (normal interval [0-45]) AST = 32 (normal interval [0-35]). Direct Bilirubin = 0.17 (normal interval [0-0.2]) Total Bilirubin = 0.48 (normal interval [0.1-1.2]) B and C hepatitis = negative. So, the Quercetin has improved my symptoms significantly, but [some] of my blood tests became worse. I stopped Quercetin. At that moment I was novice in that field and I have not realized that I need more blood tests. I started to take Silymarin [300 mg/day], Essentiale Forte [6 pills per day], Liv52. After 2 weeks (to another blood test lab): Gamma GT = 67 (normal interval [0-50]) ALT = 39 (normal interval [10-60]) AST = 30 (normal interval [10-50]) ALP = 274 (max value 270) Albumin = 4.9 (normal interval [3.5-5]) Eosinophils = 6% (max normal value is 5%); but I had this value 6 years ago too. So, my blood tests have been improved, but some are still outside the normal range. My GP ignored me telling that the values are not pathological. I also did a stool test for H Pylori and was negative. Also, I went for a upper gastroscopy and I was diagnosed with mild antral gastritis and no H. Pylori. They gave me Nexium, but I refused to take knowing the liver pain from Ranitidine and Pantoprazole. In the meantime, I have started to read more and I did tried all kind of medicine. SAMe, L-methionine, NAC = all good, reduce the liver pain and improve blood tests, but I get pain in the stomach from them and I cannot take them for too long (several days). ALT and AST are usually inside normal range, but Gamma GT and ALP never decreased below maximum value. I suspected that I have intrahepatic cholestasis from drugs, but I did not had other symptoms [no itching, urine has normal color]. Also I did a test for Bile acid in serum and the score was 1.4 (max value 10) … so, maybe is not cholestasis. I went to an ultrasound and the liver is enlarged [16 cm in diameter - I understand that normal size is 14 cm], but no other problems there. I tried TUDCA for 2 days before getting stomach pain from it … and even if the liver pain has disappeared, the blood test have jumped out of range (ALT jumped to 80, Gamma GT jumped to 90, Direct bilirubin jumped to 0.4). I also tried Medrol (Metilprednisolon) … only 1 pill of 16 mg because I got a serious stomach pain from it. The ALP has decrease with 30% from the previous value! Now is at 80% from upper range. Now I’m on phospholipids (3x 600 mg /day) and silymarin (3x 150mg / day) and much better than in December 2018. But I still have some small pain in the liver area. Also, I cannot tolerate Ranitidine (I get liver pain after 1 pill). I got liver pain even after 2 pills of Sucralfate (this drug goes to liver too?! ). I do not know from which other drugs I get liver pain because I did not tried ! Stomach is better since I started to drink water with Ph 8.8. Also eat a lot of oatmeal. Last blood test looks like this: Gamma GT = 87(normal interval [0-50]) ALT = 43 (normal interval [10-60]) AST = 21 (normal interval [10-50]) ALP = 221 (max normal value 270) Direct bilirubin = 0.18 (max normal value 0.25) Prothrombin time = 25 seconds (normal range [13 - 17]). I recall that whenever I had an open wood it took more time to stop the bleeding. What disease is that? What other tests should I make to understand the problem? Cholestasis? If so, why Bile acids in serum are so low? Why it does not respond to TUDCA? Autoimmune hepatitis? My ALT and AST are in normal range. Or what else can be there? My GP says that blood test values are not pathological … but why the liver hurts? Fatty liver? In the past I have ate a lot of chocolate trying to get some weight (now I have 65 kg at 177cm, BMI = 20.7). One year ago I had BMI = 23.6. I recall that I had some very mild liver pain after eating chocolate in the past … but the pain would have disappeared after stopping chocolate. I cannot eat sugar anymore. I cannot eat white bread or pasta because I get liver pain. I also had Hepatitis A, like 30 years ago. I did consume alcohol only occasionally (that is 4-5 drinks per year).

Not using any  , but instead each morning and night he's applying to one side a saturated borax solution and the other side a saturated baking soda solution (as we'd read that some people found baking soda helpful). We've been taking photos in order to compare as we progress. As mentioned, we are on day 6 and there is honestly some change! My clitoris which was quite white has returned to pink. And while the whole area still has some white, the pink is really starting to move in more. The biggest changes are on the side with the borax, with some change on the side with the baking soda (but since some of the borax can get rubbed off on that baking soda side we can't say for certain that the baking soda is having a major effect).

It seems to be very random. Pain below stomach and small intestines. Sometimes gets bloated before even starting to eat. This has started 6 months ago and gotten progressively worse. This is our main concern because it saps all his strength and disables him to the point where he can't even lie down comfortably. -The bloating, cramps and pain spikes up really quickly within a few minutes and then slowly drops off over a course of 2 to 4 hours. If he drinks water in that time it gets worse. -Been diagnosed with parkinsons disease 2 weeks ago. However the parkinsons specialist says the bloating is a separate issue and cannot help. -His prostate is 4 times larger than normal and that was found 3 weeks ago. He is taking medication for it now. -We have given him soup and he doesn't seem to bloat from it. -  was done on his abdomen and nothing was found other than mild diverticuloses. I want to have a MRI done ASAP. -He does not get nausea or have any blood in his stools. -Needs to drink Movicol twice daily for his bowels to progress so that he can pass his stools otherwise his body simply does not do it. He once went 4 days without going to the toilet. -  and heart pressure was done and everything is fine. He did have some low blood pressure once. -Was tested for celiac or gluten intolerance and is fine. I am trying to organize for him to see a Gastroenterology specialist ASAP.

Influenza,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/are-night-sweats-normal-3-weeks-after-flu-like-symptoms--563884,Are Night sweats normal 3 weeks after flu-like symptoms?  ,"On October I got the flu vaccine at Costco. However on January 12 I started having flu-like symptoms: severe sore throat and dry cough that lasted for 10 days, 2-3 days of mild fever, extremely week and sore joints for about 4 days, no runny nose but felt congested and post-nasal drip, and swollen lymph nodes in neck and one in the back of the head (occipital, non tender). I got tested for strep throat and mono, which came back negative, diagnosis was ""viral Faringitis"".  About 6 days after the symptoms started and 2 days after fever stopped, I started having night sweats and been having them for exactly 3 weeks now. Some nights very mild and a few nights completely soaked. This is not normal for me since I'm usually very cold and I'm used to sleeping with a lot of blankets, however now it doesn't matter if I only sleep with one blanket, it doesn't seem to help. My lymph nodes are not painful anymore however I can still feel them in the neck and in the back on the head.  I'm wondering if it's possible I got the flu even if I got the shot? And also if it's normal having night sweats and lymph nodes for this long or should I be concerned?  On a side notes: In January I started taking medication for acid reflux (pantoprazole) and I changed my birth control prescription. (In case this could be related)  Any help or experience you could share with me would be useful!! Thank you  0 likes, 10 replies "

I think this started about 3 weeks ago when I got my wisdom teeth out, and took antibiotics for about 5 days (Amoxicillin.) I had to stop taking them because I felt very ill and nauseous and could not participate in any normal activities. And then this past Tuesday, I became very ill with the flu. I had no energy, had a fever, cold chills, stuffed nose, cough, and a painful headache. Many of these symptoms started to go away by Friday or Saturday, but what replaced it was a severe stomach pain and nausea. Friday morning I woke up extremely uncomfortable, and it is now Monday and this has not gone away. For the first three days, the pain would go away when I was eating, and it almost felt like I was back to normal until I would stop eating again. Now, it's pretty much constant. It feels like a hollow/empty feeling in my stomach, and I do not really feel hungry or full ever. The nausea affects my chest, head, and throat, and I have also felt extremely low and depressed the past couple days. I do not have diarrhea and have not vomited and have not been able to, even days when I felt I needed to. I saw a doctor and he prescribed me anti-nausea medication but it has not done anything, and I have also been trying calcium supplements in case it had to do with Acid Reflux. I also considered that it could be an ulcer as I was under a high amount of stress and anxiety the week before I got the flu. Any advice is greatly appreciated!  1 like, 2 replies "

Influenza,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/debilitating-fatigue-and-dizziness-following-flu-like-symptoms-for-nearly-4-months-648827,Debilitating fatigue and dizziness following flu-like symptoms for nearly 4 months,"Hi everyone, Pretty new to these forums but I've been ill for about 3.5 months now..and have been doing a lot of research into CFS as some of the symptoms match mine and been paranoid about whether or not I have CFS. I am a 28 year old male and used to be very healthy and in the best shape of my life before I suddenly came down with this and the last couple months of my life has been like hell and the worst thing I've ever gone through. I was wondering if someone could tell me if they think I have it or not...or if someone has any idea what I am suffering from. Please bear with me for this is going to be quite long. It all started when I caught a weird flu-like bug going on vacation to korea back in december and experienced sudden flu-like and food poisoning symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, severe bodyaches, chills, severe fatigue and weakness, loss of appetite, and sometimes shortness of breath that landed me in the ER a couple times. Despite the couple trips, doctors couldn't find what was wrong with me as urine samples, blood tests, flu tests, and xrays all returned negative.  So I cut my vacation short and returned back to the states to get re-evaluated by my PCP. Immediately upon my return, I saw my PCP who told me he thinks I'm just going through the remnants of a bug I caught in Korea and should be back to normal soon after it runs its course. Couple days upon coming back, I realized a brief reprieve in some of my symptoms, diarrhea had subsided, appetite was slowly coming back, and I started experiencing some upper respiratory symptoms for a couple days such as cough, runny nose, congestion, but the debilitating fatigue, bodyaches, and weakness seemed to have dissipated.. then there were a couple days of feeling 90% normal aside for a very slight sense of dizziness which I attributed to just being bed-ridden for awhile and jet lag. Overjoyed with my recovery, I went out to go shopping at outlets, went out to meet with friends, and did some music practice...things I did normally before I became ill. I was still on vacation from work so there was nothing stressing me.. until I got into a big fight with my girlfriend and thought we were going to break up...which got me extremely sad...I remember crying myself to sleep that night. The following day I remember a relapse of symptoms similar to how I felt in Korea which included the severe fatigue, nausea, weakness, body aches, some heartburn-like IBS symptoms but no diarrhea, and again a decline in appetite, and on top of this, I had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Waking up in the mornings I felt unrefreshed, dizzy, and not too different from how I went to sleep the night before. Needless to say, I went back to my doctor who prescribed me so antidepressants (zoloft) to try and also did a full workup of my blood which came back normal again. He told me to give it another week or two and that I should feel gradually better. So for the next couple weeks I went through periods of briefly feeling better where I can run a couple errands outside like groceries and do some light exercise (walks) and ""crashes"" where I would be house-ridden and able only to do basic things like eat, wash up, watch tv, etc. I took a disability leave from work as I was unable to focus at work and the one day I tried to return, I ended up in urgent care with another attack similar to what I experienced in korea only to have the doctor send me back home saying everything is checking out fine. After about 8-9 weeks of this I did notice some gradual recovery with some lesser relapses in between: - I would be asymptomatic for longer periods during the day (I would have a 3-4 hour window of ""no symptoms"" in the beginning of jan when symptoms first re-emerged...then at this point it was more like I would have 3-4 hours total during a bad day I would feel symptoms and sometimes no symptoms at all on good days) -I started getting 7-14 day streaks of no symptoms. -On days I would exhibit symptoms it would be a less severe form of it which would include: -fatigue, but not quite as debilitating -slight loss of appetite -no more ibs or trouble falling asleep -no more diarrhea -no upper respiratory symptoms at all However, about every other week, I would experience a return of symptoms lasting a couple days (occuring in 1-3 hr episodes during the day) that included: -extremely tired (physically/mentally) -unmotivated to do anything, would dread doing things at times as if impending doom -usually cold -slightly nauseous -feel sensation of stuffiness but cold as if indigested -tingly sensation throughout arms and body as if bloodflow is restricted -happens more often in the afternoons after some exertion -feel slight pressure in the sinuses -usually accompanied with loss of appetite -lightheaded/dizzy -usually sad/moody/depressed/easily irritable/very sensitive Reported all this to my doctor and although he still stood by his initial guess that it was just a bug that was working itself through my system, he referred me to an ID specialist who ran about 15 different viral/immune tests on my blood including HIV, EBV, CMV, HHV6, syphilis, ESR, ANA, blood cultures for blood bacteria, IgG, IgM, and a couple others which all came back negative. Following all the tests, both doctors stood by their initial guesses that I just may have caught a very bad form of the flu (influenza) that may have not been properly detected in korea that is taking a particularly long time to clear out of my system given I was under stress and time zone changes and different environment (record cold temperatures in korea...I was never exposed to such cold temperatures in my life as I am from Southern California). Since the results of the viral testing has come back I haven't noticed (at least to me) any significant improvements in my symptoms... and so decided to try acupuncture for a few weeks which I have not noticed too much of a noticeable improvement in symptoms...stil couple days to a week of good followed by symptomatic days where I would experience the symptoms I mentioned above in varying intensities for 1-3 hours a day. My girlfriend and family suggested that I return to work and try to expose my body to normality again as I used to be a very active/healthy guy (would go to gym to do strength training 6 times a week, and sometimes play couple hours of full court, high intensity basketball on weekends on top of a 40+ hour work day and very involved in my local church community) and perhaps my body was just deconditioned from such a long period of inactivity and that maybe it was a mental/psychological thing. So here I am having completed one full week of work (9 hour days) now and noticed the following things: -I can get through a full day of work, albeit barely (yay!) -some days are better than others. -I am extremely exhausted after work...feel like I can't move a muscle. -Current symptoms include: *a constant dull pulsating pressure sensation behind my nose(sinuses) that causes mild to moderate dizziness and sometimes mild nausea, can last all morning and afternoon..I feel like this is the only symptom that has increased in severity perhaps because my uptick in activity? *a drastic increase in appetite (i feel frequently hungry) *increased urination..need to urinate every hour it seems like *constantly slightly tired (sleepy) *slight fatigue/body aches during the morning/afternoon..to pretty severe for about an hour or 2 after work. *moments of unmotivatedness/difficulty concentrating *moments of constricting of airways in nose making it difficult to breath productively but no mucus It just feels like it's 2-3 times harder to go through a normal day of work than it used to be before I got this illness. I am no longer sad so I stopped taking my antidepressants and feel like I'm constantly operating on a deficit of energy since returning to work... I am so sick of tracking how I am feeling and not being able to exercise like I used to or hanging out with people like I used to because I'm so ""tired"" all the time...Now I'm telling people at work that I am ""better"" but I'm definitely not and feel like I may hit another major crash going on like this... Obviously CFS is a far-off assumption (says my doctors) but I have been really identifying with some hallmark CFS symptoms like post exertional malaise, extreme unrelenting fatigue, and unrefreshing sleep... however I have experienced a gradual degree of improvement too? Sometimes when I'm in the middle of my pain I forget the strides I have made. Regardless, there are some things that I have yet to be checked as my doctors have employed a ""watchful waiting"" strategy which has been very frustrating to me...but here are some things I am suspicious of: -hormonal issues (thyroid problems or adrenal insufficiency/fatigue?) -heart issues (sometimes i feel stuffiness in my chest as well as tingling sensation in my arms as if circulation is not happening as it should...I have an odd feeling my ongoing dizziness might be related) -sinus issues (I have a history of sinus infections and thinking maybe it may be related...although my sinus pressure/dizziness doesn't come with any mucus, runny nose, discharge, or any of the classic sinusitis symptoms) -neurological issues (I have had a history of 2-3 months of severe headache/facial pain episodes, some people told me the pressure in my sinus/head can be a migraine) Seeing my doctor this coming Thurs and going to demand referrals to an ENT, neurologist, and an ECG, along with a hormonal test which I'm not sure why he did not do earlier... I mentioned some of these before but he would simply just brush me off saying those were highly unlikely and since I'm a healthy young guy, I don't fit the usual ""demographic"" of CFS or any other of these symptoms and keep insisting this is just a long-lasting flu. But 3.5 months to now nearly 4 months...really?  Somebody please let me know if I am just going crazy or maybe it's time to change my PCP... but if somebody has gone through something similar like this for 3-4 months and recovered, please let me know so that I know I'm not going crazy.  Also, I really value honest opinions and not people who just want to make me feel better. I really don't mind if what you have to say is negative as long as it's constructive...I have been suffering with this for awhile but if what worked for you is just having a simple change of attitude, please let me know what kind of treatment techniques worked for you or it just simply got better over time! I find that recovery stories are the most helpful and best thing to read about here. If you made it this far..thanks so much for reading and I am looking forward to your responses. My doctors are ""confident that I will make a full recovery and that this will be just a season for me"" and I am surely hoping so...Thanks so much!! 0 likes, 2 replies "

I came down with a sore throat and a common cold which dissipated after a few days. The following day I went to the gym feeling if I was over my cold to do some light treadmill cardio; the moment I got on going maybe 2 mph I felt an exhausting painful fatigue. I went back home after 10 mins and layed down for 3 hours until I felt better. The next 2 days I rested and felt way better as time was passing. It was midterm exams week too. The night before I had one exam, I had to print a paper and pick up dinner from the local school cafe. The moment I left the house and started walking I felt god awful just painful to walk to the library. When I was waiting for my food, I almost passed out. I felt very very tired and it was almost unbearable. I went back home feeling like crap until I slept. The following day my symptoms doubled and it felt like a flu; entire body was aching and dead tired, wobbling when I walk, etc. l called a hotline nurse who advised me to rest in bed for 2 days then get checked. I also have been instructed to eat bland foods as I had no appetite that day. Around 3 PM that afternoon, I felt like dying; the fatigue was very very strong I honestly felt better if I was dead. I somehow calmed down and I called the school doctor who said it's some sort of recovery stage after a flu or illness. The following day I felt better but I was dead tired. I layed in bed all day and I didn't dare leave the house after what I experienced two nights ago. I was just getting more and more exhausted as the day went by. The next day I woke up from a good nights sleep and I felt very weak and dead tired. It was scaring me because I have pretty bad OCD anxiety. I called 9-11 since I was unsure if it was something more then I thought. The ER drew blood and then the doctor told me it was considered ""post viral syndrome"". He said there isn't a recovery time but the idea is to rest and drink water like I didn't know that. He advised me to walk to get my energy back but I still was worried about doing that. I was discharged after an hour and I felt almost death when I got home. I just did not know how to bare the crazy fatigue. I calmed myself by listening to a strong prayer and had tomato soup which helped. Today i still am tired and I am looking for that moment of energy. I need it back. I need to resume my life and career. I read that it could take a week but some forums say it took months. I do not have months. I cannot halt my education because of some stupid insane unbearable fatigue. Does ANYBODY have any profession opinion on the recovery of this? Any bright ideas? I've been managing my stress well and trying to eat more bland foods too with nutrients. My sleep also has been great; no interruptions. I am drinking lots of water since I get thirsty from this. I've never felt this in my life either. Please help. Any advice suffices.  0 likes, 57 replies "
Infectious Disease,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/thread-worms-living-in-my-tear-ducts-608143,THREAD WORMS LIVING IN MY TEAR DUCTS,"One year ago I cut up some very old logs in my back yard. There were many different types of bugs seen between the bark and the rest of the wood. I used a chain saw, and I believed I may have breathed in dust from cutting the wood.  About one or two weeks later I started sneezing and sneezing.  As I sneezed, tiny rice shaped objects flew out of my nose.  I had no idea what it was, so I took them into my doctors office. My regular MD was no available, so I had someone new. I believed he was going to sent them for analysis to pathology lab.  He did no. The dummy threw them out. A week later I woke up in the middle of the night feeling something on my eye. I looked into my lighted make up mirror. There was a very thin worm about an inch long on my eye lash and another one on the side of my cheek. As I was looking, I actually saw one come out of my cheek at a 90 degree angle. It came straight out about 1/2 inch from my skin and started to wind about like a snake. I wiped them away with a Kleenex. Of course I wanted to save them, but they are so thin that the are not visible on Kleenex or on a tip. A few days after that I started having white stuff coming from my left eye.  I actually started irrigating my eyes 3 times daily. It was necessary to get out the tiny rice shaped objects.  They were also still in my nose. I was also cleaning my nose several times daily.  The rice  shaped objects were still  there along with some small round yellow balls  about 4 mm.  After another week the rice  shaped  objects were gone and replaced by the occasional  thin worm in my nose, mouth  and eyes. I went to the doctor for a second time. The doctor thought it could be lice, because lice can get into the eyes. He gave me  a script for something to be put into my hair and advised me to Use Vaseline on my eye lashes to prevent them from laying eggs on the eye lashes.  Then I must have swallowed the yellow little rount thing from my nose. I was getting little bumps  on my skin.  Thought maybe it was lice stuck onto my skin, so I picked them off. Under a thin layer of skin was the little round yellow balls of various sizes. Some were as large as 10 mm. They were fluctuant. I took in about 15 to the lab. The report said plant 'material, no parasite seen'.  I took a worm into the lab. Report said inanimate object.  Infectious disease refused to see me because of that report.  My doctor refused to give me anything for worms because of that report. I called the lab and asked them what would be the proper way to collect the worm. They said to put it in alcohol.  I went to a lady MD who is a personal friend of mine. She gave Ve me a prescription for albendazol.  Mabendazole no longer available in the US. Albendazol cost $250.00 per pill in the U.S. with my insurance. My lady doctor friend faxed  a script for albendazol  to a foreign drug  service. It was for 200 pills and cost me $160.00.  It took 3 weeks to get it.  I was now itching around my neck, around my ears and my scalp. They say when the worms move, it makes you itch.  I used the medication as prescribed 10 days in a row without improvement. I did this twice, without improvement.  Then I took it upon myself to double the prescribed dose. The itching almost subsided. I got 3 things from my wood cutting day. Plant material under my skin which cleared up by itself. I washed clothes, bed clothes, towels and myself and hair daily for two months to get rid of the lice. The I started washing myself and hair twice daily.  That twice daily got rid of it in one week.  The worms remain in my eyes.  The rice shaped objects were the worm larva. I read that worms crawl into your skin while you are outside. Eggs hatch in the lungs. Larva go to your mouth and is swallowed. Mine went into my nose. My sleep apnea mask blew them into my eyes.  So now I frequently feel movement in my eyes. I look in my magnifying mirror and may see the end of a worm coming out of my eye. I try to grabit with a tweezers. It either goes back into the tear ducts, or only part of it breaks off. When I feel a burning sensation in the corner of my eye, I know that eggs are being laid and I wipe them out with a q tip. When I feel a sharp sensation in the eye itself, I know the work is entering the eyeball, itself. The only thing that has really helped me in the eye are called zapper. I have 2 of them. They apparently were  developed by a German lady years ago to kill parasites. The two small   that I have, each use a 5 volt battery. I put one above the eye and one below, or one to each side. I hold them in place for hours. I feel a very slight tingling. This is supposed to kill the parasites. I believe this is the only thing that keeps them under control. The little charge does no harm to me but kills them. Some times my eyelid becomes swollen and uncomfortable. I know it is the worms. After a few hours using the zapper it will go down. So now I am stuck with these worms in my left eye. They seem to be in the tear duct. The albendazol did not kill them, but the   keep their numbers under control. 1 like, 5 replies "

Two weeks ago I started noticing strange white bits in my stool, and I have no idea whether they've always been there (since I don't normally perform regular inspections of my poo), or whether it's actually cause for concern. I visited my doctor and I sent in 4 different stool samples which were tested for all sorts of nasty parasites. It actually did come back positive for ""blastocystis hominis"" (??), which is a very vague parasite that either is bad or isn't bad (nobody seems to know), but she did not recommend treatment, since I don't have any additional symptoms, and it apparently goes away within 3 days. That was a week ago. Also, the parasite is microscopic, so it isn't the cause of what I'm seeing. That said, I feel great -- no pains, no aches, no diarrhea. I haven't traveled out of the country, but I did have sushi a few weeks ago, which of course is what I'm worried about. I'm attaching an image of what's been appearing over the last 2 weeks -- sorry, it's nasty, but that's what this forum is for, right? -- and I would really, really appreciate any insight or advice. (I had a salad with pumpkin seeds yesterday, which is what the smaller seeds are. What I'm concerned about is the large white piece to the left that looks terrifyingly like what liver flukes appear to be when I google them.) I don't remember seeing these pieces in the stool samples I sent in -- they are on and off, and they vary in size. This one is pretty big. Gross. For reference, I'm a healthy 25-year-old who exercises regularly and eats well. I usually have a diet high in seeds/nuts and fiber, but I haven't had one of my health bars or cereals in the past 2 days, so I know that's not what I'm seeing. I'm not on any medications, and I only take Vitamin C chewable tablets a few times a week.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this saga! 0 likes, 1 reply "

Told Morgellons? Told its a delusion? READ THIS!,"(please bare with my typing, grammar, and spelling as I have to do all this by phone and I try to catch how my phone changes things at time but wont always) I have been suffering from unknown parasites for nearly 9 years now. I have been to almost every specialist there is. Somehow through it all I have gotten no help. The doctors in the US now seem to treat only individual symptoms. They handle each symptom as though it is unrelated to the other.  They live in fear of treating us due to the ""addict epidemic"" in my personal opinion. So if you present with symptoms outside of the common cold you are a suspected NARCOTIC abuser, a drug seeker, or a Meth head.  It makes me sick that our government has ruined the standard of care we once had and replaced it with a healthcare field saturated in fear, suspicion, poor doctors decision making based on the fear of losing their license, stout privacy policy which is a joke as now you dont have to sign for one doctor or pharmacy to view detail or prescriptions from another!!! Through it all what does this equal for me and you? … We get no help! I I have a parasite that is now coming out of my skin, at each day at about sunset they move A LOT and it burns and itches and makes me crazy!!! They pop up through the skin.  If you get scratched or cut they IMMEDIATELY come up through the opening and begin to cover it almost appear to be an instantly formed scab. (intelligence??) They keep you depleted of trace minerals such as IRON POTASSIUM PHOSPHORUS VIT A VIT' B (especial 3, 6, 9, 12) MAGNESIUM They cause chronic dehydration and keep your blood and blood iron low causing both ANEMIAS! They make you so very very ill, my earliest symptoms were: SUDDEN onset of constipation then onset of what seemed to be intensified allergic reactions like:  itchy eyes, clogged up ears: immediate reactions to foods, smells, chemicals, perfumes & colognes were UNBEARABLE! EXTREME histamine release every time I ate or drank ANYTHING. (I was told it was food allergy but it was so so sooo much worse than that!) Began smelling bacteria like you smell at a fishing lake after nasal rinses.  My sinuses were horrible. FINALLY I began adding baby shampoo to my sinus rinse for months and it broke what ever was set up in my sinuses! SYMPTOMS spread to include: SEVERE headaches fatigue INSOMNIA inability to stay asleep problems retrieving memories problems storing short term memories my reading vision suddenly became blurry - then     the next day fine , back and forth until finally gone! NOW I wear reading glasses and they are worsening FAST! onset of food allergies asthma extreme shoulder pain constricted esophagus CANDIDA Esophagitis constant mucus draining AND coming up feeling sick after eating later, inability to finish a meal craving sweets later was NAUSEA for no reason sudden depletion of energy and more than I CAN REMEMBER AT THE MOMENT! FROM MY LEG AT HOME: FROM MY ARM: I have magnified these on my iphone only. BUT its obvious to me these are FLUKES. How horrifying. the cream and orange ones are cleak or skin tone until dead. the lay flat on our skin and attach like a leech!! Here are a couple other images!  I hope this helps others!!! these live in our tongue, tonsils, chin, and throat! 0 likes, 0 replies "

I would try and squeeze out the acne but that seemed to disrupt the area more and it would become huge and inflamed.

Following that would be weeks of heeling time, every time I would try and touch it I would disturb it profoundly and it would get worse.

I basically been in bed for 4 month and only go to doctors when I go out. Was very active and social 42 yr old before this. Right now my temple muscle on the right side is swollen pretty big for a few months they don't know why (most likely not TMJ), slight vision loss in right eye, upper part. Only time I am ok is lying down on side like typing this in bed. I have hard time even going grocery store because I get dizzy, fatigued, lights and noise start bothering me like on just left side of body I am going to pass but not quite feel super strange, sometimes body feels light, get tension headaches sometimes. At first I thought it was TIA's that happened a couple times but not so sure now. Hearing goes off and on like they are plugged. i have had 2 MRI's on head, CT angiogram on head, CTA on chest back,  , hard maybe a possible TIA after stress test. When i got first sick, ophthalmologist tested me, just said i might need reading glasses (doubtful since this happened when i got sick). Movement seems to bother my eyes and head at times like in a car or watching sports game or something. Other symptoms are feet go numb of bottom of feet, and burn occasionally (has got better), left leg gets weak now and arm at times, my toe nails have horizontal lines on them an colouration under is changing but it isnt fungus, diagnosed with   in mouth now. still jaw at times where my temple muscle is swollen. My ESR is always 1, tested like 6 times which i found strange. So probably can't be GCA, Most other tests are fairly normal. i live in toronto and because it is public health care system and cut backs it's extremely hard to get tests and proper care even if you want to pay (u cant here) though i have been to emergency a number of times.

Infectious Disease,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-am-so-depressed-with-the-thought-of-having-rabies--698467,I am so depressed with the thought of having rabies.,"Hello everyone. Lately the thought that i might have contracted rabies was really killing me and my life. The story went back to 7 months earlier, in around September 2018. My family and a neighbor house both share a backyard toghether and our neighbor had a cat. The cat at first did not like me or my other family members, however i started giving it food and it became friendlier. One afternoon while i was in the backyard, he showed up and started meowing countinously as if he was asking for food, i gave him some leftover from lunch and he ate all of them. After finished eating, he slightly rub bit of his fur into my leg then went away. Then one day later he just dissapeared and never returned since then. (He had once left home but later returned.). Ever since then i was so anxious with the idea that the cat might be rabid and i was exposed to the virus. He was not vaccinated against rabies and even though he only touched it fur on my leg, i am afraid that at somepoint my hands had touched the spot on my leg and spread the saliva to potential place for exposure. I had gone to see a doctor at at hospital for infectious deseases and he said it is not considered a threat and so vaccines was not neccessary. However even with that i still get panic and stressed over the idea that in a percentage of a thousand i did contracted rabies and they are now in my bodies. Sometimes i seemed to forget about it but later it suddenly re-appeared, hanging like a cloud over my head. If you have read all the way down here i want to say thank you and sorry for the wall of text. I don't really know what to do, and at least having spoken it all out is really a relief. Sorry for my bad English, if you have any idea or suggestion for me, it would be my honest gratitude. 0 likes, 3 replies "
Infectious Disease,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/worms-in-the-face-359087,Worms in the Face,"Hi All,  I dont know if anyone has come across this.  I have a worm infestation in my face.  They travel around under the skin leaving tracks and bursting holes into my skin.  they create glass like balls that split the skin open and move around my skin with ease.  I first reported it 3 months ago and the doctors totally ignored me treating me for a secondary infection that was caused by open wounds in my face.  They have given me 4 courses of antibiotics treating the wrong infect but totally ignored waht I was telling ithem about the worms.  The worms whatever they are are very sharp and whereever they travel through in my face the skin collapses, leaving it like plastercine and it causes tiny splinters that are as sharp as anything that inbed themselves in the inside and outside of my skin right down to the lowest skin level. My skin is also producing a clear sticky substance which feels like little shards of glass if I touch it.  All in all, it really couldnt be much worse except for the fact they have made a hole around my mouth which they can look out of.  I am totally sane! I am in pieces.  I've been telling the doctors what it is and they have totally ignored me.  Even refusing to refer after an A & E i visited confirmed I needed to be referred as the lesions had been on my face for so long.    I discovered I had private medical care through my company which now thank god means I've seen my first dermatologist.  He's referred me to another dermatlogist that apparently knows more about things in the skin who I'm yet to see.  Even though he's now put me in the right direction, I'm not convinced he was sure it is worms.  I can pull 1/2 inch worms out of my skin bit by bit.  They look like thread worms and never come out intact, you pull little bits off of them.  It leaves worm shape dents in my face and they feel like little match sticks under the skin.  Nobody is taking me seriously as people dont really get worms in the face.  They have totally destroyed me skin and I have bad scaring.  I have never had acne and had no scaring.   This has all been caused in the last 3 months.  I dread to think how many are alive in there now they'v been left so long.

Infectious Mononucleosis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-one-year-since-getting-mono-update-671569,My One Year Since Getting Mono Update,"Hello all! I wrote a post about a week ago but I had intended on doing one on this day for awhile now, so here goes. Spring and Summer 2017 I had been pushing hard. I rock climb, its my passion (I currently work at a gym doing instruction and other things.) It is a very demanding sport, but I love it. Anyway, I was climbing about five days a week, often outside, in increasingly hot conditions. In July I started experiencing a weird sensation in my throat once every few days. A weird, vibrating feeling that almost felt like I was gargling. I'd never experienced a sensation like it. Thought, maybe its a muscle spasm or maybe I'm getting sick. Now I think it was the virus incubating or something. August 1st, 2017. Its hot, there are wildfires messing up the air, I'm out playing disc golf before work. As I get to work I feel like my heart is beating faster and more noticeably than normal. I go in the cooler to cool off (grocery store) and feel slightly better. Over the next few days, I get dizziness, flu-like feelings, a sore throat and occasional bouts of a brief racing heart. Tacking it up to the flu or something, I press on. I go on a trip to Canada that I'd scheduled months before that I'd been looking forward to. Climbed for four days despite frequent bouts of dizziness, faintness, exhaustion after climbing. August continues on and I continue to experience intermittent symptoms like this. I go to a Naturopath and he thinks I have a combination of allergies and a low grade virus. I get essential oil blends for immune health. September, sick feeling at times but still taking climbing trips and going to the gym frequently. October is the same. End of October I get a racing heart at work and feel panicky, fluey, unwell. Halloween I drag myself to the local climbing spot and manage to do my most difficult route ever, knowing it'll be rain for months after that day. It takes so much out of me I'm severely exhausted. I make an appointment to a GP and get tests done. At first all they can find is my blood pressure reads a bit high. I insist I get tested for mono because after scouring online its the only thing that roughly matches my symptoms and duration. A few nights later I wake up feeling very flu-like, heart racing, feel panicked and unwell. That morning I go to an urgent care, who have me go the the ED. I get my chest x-rayed and get an appointment with a cardiologist. I eventually get to wear a holter device for two weeks that takes readings of my heart. That came out normal, they said. Chest x-ray normal. They prescribe me a low dose medicine for blood pressure which I take for two rounds and then stop. A few days after the ED visit I get the results that I have a recent EBV infection and I have mono. I am relieved to have a diagnosis. I am granted a week off of work and then reduced hours for several weeks after. The next few months I experience all manner of symptoms, I make it to work all but a handful of days, and I experience gradual, cyclical improvement. On New Years Eve, I go to a movie with my girlfriend and almost have to leave because the dark room and loud noises from the theater overwhelm my system. Mid February I wake up weak and lethargic, yet manage to get myself to an endurance climbing competition at my local gym and get second place out of over 100. March I go on a five day trip to Bishop, California to climb. I am nervous to be away from my girlfriend and be camped out in the desert in case I start feeling ill out there. I feel very flu-like on the long car ride over and have visions of asking my friends to drop me off and let me catch a plane home. But it passes and I commit to the trip. I am weaker than I used to be outdoors but I still have fun and stick it out. April I get engaged. I have mostly good days in April. May I go on the  , eat very healthily for a month. I also quit my old job and started at the climbing gym. I feel mostly good this month too, just a few moments in a few days a week where the flu-like feelings come into my head. June I eat crappily after all the diligence of May. I feel like my climbing performance is almost back to where it was the previous year. The one big bummer is I'm noticing I have a mysterious allergy in my living room of my apartment. We try everything, carpet cleaning, dehumidifier, expensive purifier, fans, cleaning every inch of the wall. Landlord swears we shouldn't have mold, its not an old building. No sign of major water damage really, and no one feels anything but me. I lived here for almost five years without this sensation. Its like mono exacerbated my allergies. Then July. Fresh off another four day climbing trip, I continue the high pace. Its summer, its heating up. On July 4th, after ten days straight of climbing, I start feeling rather bleh. I try to take it easier, but it seems like my high pace and lazy diet is catching up with me. One night I wake up middle of the night with the malaise, which hasn't happened since like December or so. We have a heat wave mid month, and one day after work I'm driving home, its so hot and I feel so stressed, and I get the racing heart feeling again for the first time since November or December. Needless to say, I'm discouraged. I'm worried I overdid things and in combination with the heat suffered a major relapse. I call in sick one day in July, and barely make it through a couple others. As I realize the potential severity of what has happened, I scale back my climbing like crazy. I know it sounds crazy to you guys, but the longest I had gone without climbing this whole year was 7 days back when I first got diagnosed. The doctor had checked my spleen and said I was okay to exercise. So I'm back on the horse of eating healthier, and resting more from climbing than I have all year. The last two days I've felt a lot better than the previous three weeks. I'm rally hoping its just a bump in the road. So as you can see, I've lived a pretty functional life this year, though I've had at least some symptom of this virus almost every day. It hasn't kept me from living life, but it has given me a lot of suffering and stress. I think I'm finally understanding the need to take it slow and look into the future, that I will have years ahead to give things my all, but I need to scale back if I want to be rid of this thing for good. I believe that I will get over this thing for good. I appreciate all on here who have given me encouragement. Anyone who has a question or comment I'm happy to talk to.

I seemed to be getting gradually better through June of 2018 when I overdid it with a lot of activity and had a fair relapse. Since then, my health has been a little touch and go. I felt pretty sick in late October and missed five days of work. I went on a trip for two weeks around Christmas that was fun but stressful. Now for the last week and a half, I've been feeling really down. I had this really strong anxiety arise in me on several nights occasions. And my fatigue and light nausea have been pretty prevalent as well. I've missed three days in the last week and a half. I dont think I feel quite as bad as when this initially hit me a year and a half ago, but it feels close sometimes, and it scares me that its either going to keep  cycling through like this for years, or that i could gradually get worse. I have been looking on some cfs forums admittedly and a lot of them talk about a slow gradual decline after having an infection like mono. I just wanted to vent some. I climbed pretty much nonstop throughout this last year, trying to push through everything, and i think im finally commited to taking a solid month, possibly more, from hard exercise. Right now, a walk around the park is fatiguing. If anyone can relate or has positive words, I would appreciate it. I usually post positive things on here because overall my case has been on the more mild side since Ive been able to work, exercise, and travel most of the time, but the sheer duration of time and now this setback has been a discouraging time for me.

Infectious Mononucleosis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/a-little-update-696574,A little update ,"So I know I have recently joined this community but I thought it would be nice to give an update about myself so we can all learn from each other about our experiences. If you read my previous post I was diagnosed with chronic mono around two weeks ago. I was very upset and worried but overcame that knowing I will someday get over it. A few days ago I went to the doctor and got a referral to an infectious disease doctor. Come to find out this doctor wrote research papers on EBV which gives me peace of mind that he will be my doctor and knows what he is doing as he has been there 28+ years. As I put in my previous post I was suffering from   and   from the mono. However I found some interesting ways to overcome this anxiety and have only had minor anxiety. I suggest if you are experiencing any anxiety to get outdoors no matter what. Just being outdoors maybe moving around a little and talking to family has relieved my symptoms to a manageable level. I also recently have been trying to get back into an exercise routine (5 minutes of light walking compared to usually an hour of exercise seems little) but I can tell the pull on your body when you exercise with mono so I have been taking it slow. Hopefully this specialist I will see have some suggestions/answers. Currently the main symptoms I have been having is a feeling of something on my chest or pressure in my stomach area and it feels difficult to breathe but I know and all doctors have said my lines are perfect, a little blurred vision (which is a little scary to me) fatigue, my eyes feel heavy and weak, and other weird and unexplained feelings and sensations. I am a little worried about the blurred vision any information on this would be helpful. 0 likes, 6 replies "

Infectious Mononucleosis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/19-months-and-finally-a-diagnosis--695794,19 months and finally a diagnosis! ,"Hi guys!  Wanted to check in with you all because this forum has been an absolute lifesaver for me. Last week I finally decided to see  a Lyme Literate doctor after getting 2 indeterminate Lyme tests. *My backstory:  July 2017 I fell really ill.  Fainting, stiff neck,  , lowgrade  , canker sores on my throat, swollen lymph nodes, shaking, and extreme fatigue.  After 5 weeks of docs and tests, I finally showed a positive mono spot test.  Although my spleen and liver were fine, I took   and never got the rash.   I started to recover three months later only to completely relapse after attempting exercise.  Ever since I've been in this 'get a little better and then relapse for weeks' cycle. I met with a very smart and very patient doc.  My last Lyme test showed I was positive for Lyme.  So while I may have had mono- the Lyme and different co-infections are what's wreaking havoc now. (HHV6, EBV). I'm starting on Artemisinin now for a month and will meet with her again to talk about pulsing antibiotics. (I'm also on monolauren.)  I also have been on a keto diet for 4 weeks and feel a bit better.  It completely regulated my blood sugar which had been a problem.  It also has brought my blood pressure up to 110/70 which is huge! I have a big battle ahead of me and will probably move most of my updates to a lyme forum.  I have a twitter account that I've been documenting from (MonoMom16) and I will check in here periodically too to see how you all are doing. Don't give up seeking answers!  If you feel like more is going on in your body, find a doctor who will listen.  You know your body best.  I refused to accept a chronic fatigue syndrome diagnosis.  I knew there was something we just couldn't find yet.  Getting a diagnosis is huge.  It is such a relief to have a face to this monster.   I'll be thinking about y'all and sending all my good healing juju your way!  You are strong and resilient.  You got this. 0 likes, 7 replies "

Almost daily at some point, i will experience the sensation of being able to feel my blood/something pulsing inside of my body. I'll most often feel this in the vicinity of my chest or neck. sometimes it feels like my heart is pounding but if i put my hand on mu chest, there isnt a feeling of movement, whereas if i got cut off in traffic and i put my hand on my chest, i can feel the thump of my heart through my chest. also, my heart rate is still in a normal range with this pulsing, its usually no higher than 80 bpm, but it is definitely an agitated feeling. also, i had a whole battery of heart tests when i first got sick and they say my heart is healthy, although my top blood pressure number is high, which my naturopath thinks can be related to the stress of the body fighting infection. Anyway, this pulsing gets worse after heavy meals and at night, and its usually absent in the morning and kind of builds as the day goes on. i used to think it was increased blood flow intensity to areas of my chest and throat where the virus was occupying my body in an effort to kill it, but im not sure. occasionally id feel pulsing in my fingertips too, i think that may be because i rock climb and my fingers get worked snd its them reparing. Lastly, sometimes i wonder if im a little crazy and just hyper aware of my blood flow and pulse now and am just making it worse by always checking in with it. or perhaps its my immune or nervous system that causes this sensation. please let me know if you experience feeling a pulsing within you. 0 likes, 15 replies "

I think there's a negative post bias that understandably happens where most people post when they're concerned, but not when they've recovered.

On the other hand reading someone's recovery story, including the darkest parts of the illness, can give hope and aid in the healing process.

I've been suffering for about 10 weeks with some kind of mystery virus and am wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar recently?

Then I had a high fever and felt all kinds of terrible with bronchitis symptoms.  It then seemed to spread downwards and I had trouble in that department both front and back. Whatever it was that was attacking me also had me getting chills, and sweating far too much, even at night. Plus, it seemed to kick off a bad case of anxiety and I had anxiety-related symptoms. Others I mustn't forgot to mention are: aches, painful joints, red eye, dry mouth. I got tested for Flu and also Mono/GF, but both were negative. So it must have been virus! I'm still having some symptoms too, but overall feel better than I did, just haven't gotten rid of it yet I don't think.

Influenza,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/just-want-to-vent-about-doctor-visit-688966,Just want to vent about doctor visit ,"I think I just need to vent. I don’t get sick very often thankfully. But the other week for work I was visiting a refugee camp in another country. The conditions were notoriously bad and officials were in the midst of shutting it down and relocating it. World Health Organization officials were visiting as well and complained about the conditions of the encampment. Near the end of my trip I began to feel sick. It came on quickly. Sore throat, fatigue, chills, sweating profusely, a splitting headache that did not respond to ibuprofen. Then nausea and vomiting (came on so quickly that I was driving and didn’t have time to pull off the road before I was sick to my stomach.)  I was sick enough that I felt unable to travel and got a hotel room for a few days to wait it out before returning to the US. After that the nausea and vomiting went away and symptoms became more like a cold or flu-extremely sore throat, dry cough, chest pressure and some trouble breathing, sinus pain and all my teeth hurt, ears stuffed up though not a lot of head congestion, drained of energy etc. After a week of that I finally decided to go to the walk in clinic. I figured I had the flu but since I had visited a foreign refugee camp I thought I would get a professional opinion just in case. The doctor basically dismissed all my symptoms as unrelated and suggested I wasn’t sick at all. My earlier nausea and vomiting was just a fluke. My temperature (taken on a laser thermometer pointed at my forehead) was 99.9 so I didn’t have a fever by that point. My congestion was probably allergies, she said. She saw white lesions on my tonsils and told me they were just tonsil stones and unrelated to my illness. It seemed odd as I’ve never had throat problems before I became ill. She basically said I had no cold, no flu, nothing at all. While I was glad to confirm my feelings that I hadn’t picked up any more serious illness in the refugee camp (that was the main purpose of my visit), I was really annoyed that all of my symptoms seemed to be dismissed out of hand as coincidental and unrelated to each other and not indicative of a cold or flu. I rarely get sick and tend to bounce back quickly when I do, so I’m not one to complain about how I feel unless I have a very good reason. It’s been 5 days since the doctor visit and I’m still not 100%. (very sore throat and wet productive cough.) Next year I will definitely get a flu shot! 0 likes, 1 reply "
Influenza,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/no-idea-what-it-is-but-it-s-worrisome-664287,"No idea what it is, but it's worrisome","Hi everyone, I think I've got some kind of flu after my holiday in Greece, last week. When I arrived home last Friday in the morning, everything was fine. By the end of the day, I've got very tired but it didn't concerned me too much as this usual for me after having too much sun. Saturday morning when I woke up, all the typical flu symptoms were present: sore throat, muscle pain, joint pain, headache, pain behind the eyes (especially when moving them). The symptoms evolved in the next days, and I've started to cough compulsively especially during the night and to have fever. Now the cough is still there, but very manageable. At least I can sleep. The fever seems to be gone as well. The thing I'm most concern about is my heart rate and my blood pressure. For some 2-3 days in a row now, my blood pressure is elevated but my heart rate seems to be too low.  Here are some readings. Before having the flu: 10/06/2018 - 124/80 78HR 12/06/2018 - 122/71 87HR When flu present: 20/06/2018 18:23 - 182/108 61HR (I was feeling weird; like something was pumping in my stomach and very sleepy; multiple measurements were done to confirm)  18:34 - 161/94 64HR 19:21 - 149/95 56HR 20:04 - 128/86 65HR 20:30 - 133/91 68HR 20:55 - 143/94 58HR 21:21 - 148/89 58HR 21/06/2018 02:10 - 127/81 63HR 13:39 - 144/93 71HR 15:35 - 146/93 62HR 17:36 - 144/89 59HR 18:18 - 146/91 56HR 19:54 - 138/85 64HR 22/06/2018 01:52 - 126/83 61HR 11:20 - 153/100 62HR 12:06 - 154/102 63HR The reason I keep an eye on my blood pressure is because I'm a diabetic type 1 for some 30 years now. In time, I've developed kidney complications that lead to higher than normal blood pressure. Normally, I use Irbesartan to treat this, but it's an on and off thing, as I'm not very consistent. The reading you see there before my holiday, is my normal blood pressure without medication of any sort. What I could see is, the higher the blood pressure goes, the lower the heart rate goes. My normal heart rate when resting and fully awake and alert never goes below 70. Only when I'm about to fall asleep, it drops below 70. So any idea what this can be? It isn't anxiety or anything like that. Most probably that would involve an elevated heart rate. Actually I'm quite calm, even too calm. I'm always sleepy, and sometimes even a bit confused. I feel this pressure in my skull somehow. Weird stuff.   Another weird thing is the fact that most of the day, I can hear my blood flow through my ears, pumping, but not like percussion. It's slower than that I've read a lot of scary things about Legionella. Could this be the case? Any idea people? The GP is the UK is pretty much useless.

My mother called me yesterday to ask if she could come and stay with me so she doesnt contract the virus and I imagine she is quite bored.

Lies have been spread far and wide.  Traps are set repeatedly which I am gladly wise to now.  I've had the entire organisation thinking I was a drug addict (his work), I've had false rumours about workplace relationships, online chats edited and circulated to paint me in a false light, and outright physical intimidation when he turned up to my work event with 2 ""heavies"".   It has been hard enough to bat off these allegations, but after researching I now understand this guy is a bona fide sociopath of some sort.  The planning of his various schemes is clearly thought through. So, following a divorce I was extremely vulnerable and he randomly started to befriend me with a kind of ""bygones be bygones"" type approach.  He set up a meeting where he had per ordered my drink and we sat and drank this.  The moment it was finished, his face spread into a wide smirk, or grin and he left.  it was instantaneous to my finishing the drink and he immediately reverted to being aggressive straight after. After this, I developed a mystery illness which included over active bladder and twitches.  This I think was about 6 months after and doctors said it was stress related due to divorce.   Basically, I would not put ANYTHING past this individual and the manner in which this incident with the drink happened has troubled me. Clearly, this was I think about 2-3 years ago and my health is fine now, but I understand there are toxins. cancerogens etc which exist.  I know this sounds far-fetched but this guy is like nothing I've ever experienced before in my life in his devious and manipulative actions of malice. Please don't recommend mental health, my ex was schizophrenic and I know what a delusion is.  I am not going to GP on this basis.  Many people have no experience of psychopaths or being targeted by one. I am hoping this guy just peed or spat in my coffee, that is most likely it.  However, I don't exclude worse so if anyone can explain a) what the possibilities are and b) how one could test for these it would be appreciated. I know this sounds a wee bit paranoid but I gave someone who has attempted to unjustly get me fired and ruined my reputation access to my body.   0 likes, 0 replies "
Investigations and Procedures,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/printable-organs-informational--678595,Printable Organs (informational),"According to “Organ Donation Statistic” (2018), more than 114,000 people needed an organ transplant in 2017. Due to the shortage of viable organ to be harvested, nearly 22 people die each day waiting for an organ. However, new technology that can use ones’ own stem cells to generate a printable organ might just be the remedy the healthcare industry needs. Although this innovation is new and is still in the groundbreaking phase, scientist and research are hopeful that a printable organ could be feasible. So what is a printable organ, and how does it work exactly. A printable organ is created by 3D printing technology and designed for organ replacement. A person’s stem cells will be harvested, coaxed into becoming different types of cells, then a bio printer assembles the cells onto a scaffold layer by layer to generate a new organ (Ogunnaike, 2016).. The organ will be placed in an incubator until it ready to transplantation. Thus far skin for burn victims and airway splints for babies with tracheobronchomalacia have been created through 3D printing, and has caused the industry to be optimistic that more organs are to come. This new technology has the potential to change the impact on foreseen inflated medical cost because this technology is much more cost effective than harvesting traditional human organ for transplant. The process involves building solid, three-dimensional objects from a digital model, using additive processes in which successive layers of material are assembled on top of one another to build the desired object (Hendricks, 2016). This way of design is more precise, eliminates error, eliminates waste and extraction cost- all of which drive up the cost.

Investigations and Procedures,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/-no-significant-abnormalities-in-previous-mri-674367,'No Significant Abnormalities' in previous MRI,"Hi guys, I've just been putting away a load of old letters from clinic appointments and drs and came across the letter to my GP from a scan I had in February. The letter states there are no 'significant abnormalities'. At first, I didn't even read the letter because the doctor had told me there were no concerns. I'm just now realising that the wording suggest there   abnormalities, but no really significant ones. Considering how thyroid cancer was missed in scans/tests my dad had years ago led to him dying a few years later because it wasn't diagnosed, I'm a little concerned. The reasoning at that time was that 'they weren't looking for that' and it just wasn't passed over to the relevant department. I'm suffering a raft of symptoms that I'm currently in the process of being looked at for having a B12 deficiency and autoimmune disorders but that wording just concerned me.

Investigations and Procedures,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/weird-reaction-during-mri--625400,Weird Reaction During MRI?,"This is going to sound crazy but please, bear with me. I had my first brain MRI yesterday and the experience was something that I have had a hard time explaining. As you know, with each set of pictures taken, there are different pitches of hums and whirs. Well, initially, I noticed that I could almost feel certain areas of my brain being ""targeted"" by the sounds. As the MRI progressed, certain sounds became almost painful to various areas of my brain. Now, before I continue, I would like to say, I was wearing earplugs. I could hear the sounds (obviously) but they did NOT hurt my ears).  Although I was uncomfortable, I was also intrigued by the way my brain was reacting to the scan. In order to pass the time, I focused on the sounds of the machine and the areas of my brain that seemed to be reacting. Those areas changed with each sound. Toward the end of the MRI, things got a little scary. In the third from last set of pictures, my body started getting very warm, starting at my uterus (oddly enough). I felt almost a flattening and pulling-type feeling around the temples. It also felt like the right side of my face was being dragged downward. When I closed my eyes and tried to breathe through it, I immediately felt like I was turned onto my left side. That lasted for about 3 minutes. The next set of pictures were ok, reverting back to how the rest of the scan felt, with only a specific area being targeted.  The last set of pictures truly scared me. Almost immediately, it felt like my frontal lobe was rolling, temple to temple: left to right and back again, repeatedly, and with increasing speed. Almost like a kneading motion. My eyes widened and became hyper-focused; I couldn't blink. My jaw tightened, my tongue pressed to the roof of my mouth, my fingers flexed, and my vision alternated between clear and blurry. I was very much aware of what was happening but had no control. This did not last for the entire duration of the last set of pictures. I was able to force myself to blink about 30 seconds before the MRI was completed. Once I blinked, I was able to regain control of everything else fairly quickly. I'm sure all of this sounds pretty crazy but I have been researching since leaving the MRI yesterday morning and have been unable to find any information on experiences like mine. I had no sedation and am not claustrophobic. Today I have been unnaturally exhausted and have caught myself randomly falling asleep sitting up which is unusual for me.

So I don’t know what to think, or what it could be. But it hurts miserably. The doctors said its probably  . But I’m not constipated. My bowel movements are fairly normal and so is the consistency. And of course I still have my terrible IBS attacks and that’s when the bump in my stomach hurts the most. So what do guys think this is and what should I do? 0 likes, 7 replies "

Irritable Bowel Syndrome,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/the-threat-of-removing-my-reasonable-adjustments-at-work-please-help--698629,The threat of removing my reasonable adjustments at work - please help!,"Hi I've not been on the forum for ages because, although self-managing my IBS and diverticulosis symptoms, being afforded the ability to work from home during a flare up meant that I felt I was coping with this chronic condition. For some reason, my employer has now decided that they no longer want to allow me the flexibility to work from home.  An Occupational Health review in Apr 2016 said that I was fit to carry out my contractual duties at work and the only reasonable adjustment required is to allow me home-working during a flare up.  In a team of 7 full-timers, 4 of us are able to work flexibly, although I'm the only one that does this due to reasonable adjustments and on an 'as needed' basis instead of a set pattern taken weekly / or alternate Fridays. I've averaged 14 days of flare ups since 2015 and have only needed to take sickness absence for non-related issues on 2 occasions totalling 4.5 days.  Yet, in spite of not reaching the absence management trigger, and only working from home for 8 days of flare ups, my employer felt it necessary to review my occupational health arrangements.  I had questioned the validity of the request, but when assured it was to check to see if they're supporting me all the ways that they can, I happily agreed first to an OHU referral, but then it was amended to a 'Request for Medical Records from a GP'. In my GPs response, he pointed out that I have the two chronic conditions that had been diagnosed by their referral to a specialist Gastroenterologist, and by following the fodmap food management programme 'and the support you provide by allowing home-working', the GP confirmed that I'd not needed their support with the symptoms since Feb 2016.  And here's the problem... ...it was suggested by my line manager that because I'd not been to the GP each time I'd had a flare up, that this meant the GP's report was of little use.  So, having spoken with HR, they were only going to allow me the flexibility to work from home 6 days a year; any IBS flare ups occurring after the 6 days meant that must take sickness absence...and be monitored through the absence management process?!!?! I've requested clarification from HR on the following points: HR have come back and said they'd like to arrange an informal meeting between the 3 parties.  Can any of you offer me some guidance in preparation; particularly about the legitimacy of their claim that once diagnosed, I must still seek medical assistance whenever I have a flare up?  Out of our full team of 12 L&D professionals (I design the online learning and manage the online library of content), my line manager has 4 direct reports.  Her management style asks us to fill out a daily WIP sheet, so she can see what we're working on and how much time it takes.  This isn't a problem, once analysed it shows where we've been productive or where we can streamline a process.  But the point is that my line manager can see in real-time my productivity levels as I keep this up to date when working from the office or at home.   There is no reason to believe that when I'm home-working, I'm NOT working. I've got access to all my systems, my emails, and my team when at home; the only thing I don't have is a work phone.  My manager said that the rationale for not letting me have the reasonable adjustment to work from home is because if someone needs me urgently, they have to wait for me to have read an email request...and that is unacceptable to the business apparently?!?!?!  All 12 of us L&D professionals are either in and out of meetings or delivering learning through coaching or workshops, so we all have an agreement that any request will be answered in 24 hours.  It makes no sense that a person needing to wait a few hours for my email response - or me calling them back from my personal phone - is in someway detrimental to my business? Again, any guidance or clarification is much appreciated. Many thanks x 0 likes, 5 replies "

A month later I was admitted into hospital again as my kidney infection had return, however it was not as sever as my previous infection. I have heard one story from a friend that her sister had untreated glandular fever within the same year required a kidney transplant due to kidney failure.

I PLZ need feedback to quit worrying about cancer from those who  had LARGE FAST-GROWTH Cysts!," <P> I've had back pain since a child from scoliosis, but in '06, due to trauma,  injured my right side sacral region (lowest part) of spine. A golfball-sized mass & visual protrusion developed soon after (however never appearing or feeling to enlarge). I suffered from even more back pain than normal, but didn't have insurance at the time. I have many health complications & see many specialists so when I got insurance back, I kept forgetting to mention my back/top buttox mass. Some months ago, I finally did and my PC referred me to a back/tumor surgeon. <P> Ironically enough, (13 weeks ago) before my 1st appt at the surgery center, I lost all feeling in my right leg from hip to knee. Days later it came back, but so did what felt like enlarged lymph nodes in my right thigh. Those went away after a week but I continued to have several different nerve issues with my leg, EXTREME pain, swelling and bruising that would come & go, and general feeling of malaise. Fighting w/ insurance to get an MRI or CT, I was denied & forced to get instead a (quite lengthy & detailed) ultrasound. Those results showed two distinct masses. Although smaller in size, the ultrasound was able to detect both necrosis and calcification- which the radiologist noted he believed specifically  to be Heterotopic Ossification (the abnormal growth of bone in soft tissues and muscle following trauma). <P> Due to the nature of sonography - they were unable to see the depth and spread of the hardening and spreading situation around these masses. No masses were seen on my right thigh ultrasound, but they did detect the blood was moving rather slow in my right leg. My back surgeon said this all could absolutely cause the debilitating pain I had been experiencing, which at that point, was some days keeping me bed ridden with heating pads it would get so bad. I was unable to work many days when I needed to (I'm a single mother, so not working is especially not an option, but when you can't really walk at all, what is one supposed to do but be patient and do the best you can until you're approved for more testing?) <P> Due to the level of complications surrounding my spinal chord, I was referred out to a neuro/spinal surgeon as well vascular surgeon for the blood flow. <P> I have cervical dysplasia, so my OBGYN has me come in 4 times a year, rotating ultrasounds and colposcopies. My last check-up ultrasound was months ago, and showed zero abnormal growths in any reproductive areas. I had a colposcopy check-up in December, and told her I wanted a full STD check since those lymph nodes that enlarged at the beginning of the leg pain mess are lymph nodes associated with STD's. I also for an entire year, had infrequent 20-40 second-long bouts of stabbing pain in the area (which she was aware of), and at one point it was so bad I questioned if my appendix was bursting—but again, nothing unusual showed on any ultrasound, biopsy (other than my monitored dysolasia), or blood test. <P> Although I wasn't due for my ultrasound check up for a couple months, my OB scheduled one for this past Tuesday when my STD screening came back negative - she figured since my surgeon was still working to get a CT or MRI approved, she would go in and see if she could see anything from her end of things as far as my recently discovered spinal-associated masses went.  **  <P> , literally on the other side of these sacral region masses!? I'm more of a petite figure (5'3"", 110ish lbs), so her assumptions were all the pain, the recent nerve things, the slow vascular flow and the coming and going of what felt like swollen lymph nodes or blood clots - she attributed it all to this cyst. She didn't discredit by any means pain associated with the 12 year long palpable neoplasm (which was growing, only inwards, calcifying things along its way) - but she did make clear the ovarian cyst was of absolute abnormal size, and that it needed to be removed soon since it was contorting, and because of the very real possibility of it cutting off blood supply to my right leg in the near future. She also attributed my recent month long bout of nausea & vomiting (which I thought was from high levels of pain) to the extreme amounts of hormones that large cysts can release. <P> So she scheduled me a laparoscopy for the upcoming 22nd and explained how when she is removing the cyst, may end up taking the ovary, and possibly even both. I joked she could have them, I'm 35 & done baby-making, but the seriousness in her typically bubbly and playful personality caught me a big off guard. <P> Since I've never had an ovarian cyst, I was having a hard time swallowing how something that just popped up out of no where could be causing all the recent 13-week complications that a 12 year long painful spinal chord injury directly adjacent to it has, which is when she explained how when ovaries flip upside down will cause severe lower back & muscle strain pain, affecting blood vessels and the same nerves that would cause the original temporary loss of sensation in my leg. <P> ... however I just had already been mentally preparing myself for a rather intense surgery removing the abnormal growth of calcification around my freaking spinal chord - and suddenly a simple outpatient procedure  ? for   kind of pain?! <P> She said I would get a call from her nurse soon explaining what to expect on all potential outcomes, on the parts that might have to go, and recovery times for all so I felt armed and ready.   <P> I spent the rest of Tuesday not thinking about it & going on a first date with a guy I had been excited about (who I went on another successful one with yesterday in case you were curious!) <P> ...but when I woke up yesterday, and the reality hit more, I read a bit online, (not much - because as mentioned, I have the craziest most extensive list of seemingly unrelated dx's, a 4.5 year long fever no one can figure out, 14 specialists and now 5 surgeons- I   to not play Google Doc, because that's pointblank pointless.) I'd rather just wait with as much grace and patience as I can summon, & deal with what I need to when I get there, no sense in wasting energy   <P> ...so yeah, then yesterday I was reading some info online- just about cysts in general, how they form, the procedure, etc., and took note my cyst seemed to have grown rather fast, and that 4+ish"" diameter was not only rather large, but ""gigantic"" - according to the pathological terminology I crossed, but I shook off any worry. <P> I am a traveling photographer and do lots of contract work for a company that sends me all over the US. I reached out to the girl who schedules my trips and gave her the timespan on days I was unable to shoot. Empathetic as she is, she asked me questions out of curiosity and because she wanted to make sure my health was okay. I told her about my little cyst situation, brushing it off as the no biggie it had felt like  . <P> Apparently her last job for 5 years was working with an Ovarian Cancer Non-Profit foundation, so she probed just a respectable amount, and I probably answered a bit more in depth than both she or I were expecting — but I've been a bit worried since my talk with her. Not because she scared me - but because I listened to her and ""relapsed"" by getting on Google and scaring myself just a bit. <P>  <P> She basically left me feeling like my ovarian cyst situation was uncommon (comparatively speaking to the millions of cysts that come & go, most undetected every year). <P> Mentioning the speed, size, abnormal growths directly on the other side of cyst/ovary wall -  she wouldn't be surprised if I ended up with a hysterectomy, and that if I don't, I should consider one. <P> I went to no concern in the entire world to a WTF when she said the 'h' word;  .... but this lady  dealt with women who only had abnormal ovarian situations where malignancies were found,  , I convinced myself. <P> Naturally though, she did get me thinking. <P>  If the slowly engulfing mass behind my cyst (that I still need biopsied) are cellularly connected- that is by definition what cancer is, correct? Abnormal tissue that grows and moves into different tissue and muscle and causes complications? Or grows into the gland beside it? I mean, I've never dealt with masses and cysts before this, but they literally are NEXT TO EACH OTHER. <P> So I closed out google and decided to join my first health forum. <P>  <P> I honestly don't think I have cancer, and I'm 12 days away from finding out regardless but it feels harder than normal for me to stay calm given the weight of my situation. <P> <P> <hr> With that being said: <P>  <P>  <P>  <P>  <P>  <P> <P> I'm just trying to be as realistic as possible at this point. 12 days feels like a long time, which I'm confident many of you know. <P> If you made it this far, I appreciate your taking the time to read this, as well anyone who takes additional time to respond. <P> Have a beautiful day & I wish you good health moving forward. <P> <hr> <hr> 0 likes, 2 replies "

The surgeon said my uterus and other ovary looked good.  3 days ago I started my period - on its due date - and the day after that started experiencing intense   (to the point of having to change my bedding and clothes) and hot flushes which felt like waves of heat rising up my neck, into my cheeks and face and lasting a minute or two. Worse than anything was the night sweats though - freezing outside of the blanket, dripping wet and boiling under it. I have barely slept 12 hours since the surgery. I'm surprised by how little information is out there about the hormonal ""shift"" that simply must occur in one's body when one 'stage' of the reproductive loop is removed from the equation. I wish my surgeon had given me more information but perhaps even more information would not have satisfied my inherent feeling that my right, remaining ovary is actually dead and I've gone into menopause. More likely, I think, is that my ovary is stunned from the full cut surgery and losing its mate and that it will take time to wake up. But in the interim, are menopausal like symptoms something anyone here has experienced after the removal of just one ovary? I keep being told that no, I won't be menopausal if I have one ovary left, but the health of the ovary is still to be seen. I have no kids and would be completely shattered to go into early menopause (I am 33).  I know it's early days - and last night I actually had far few 'wet episodes' which made me feel really positive today. I also spoke to my surgeon who said that it is a bit 'unusual' that I am experiencing menopausal symptoms but that she thinks my righty is just fast asleep and will be engaged again soon. I wonder how my period might play a role and if this is a good sign that it arrived as expected 3 days after surgery? Could my right ovary and brain already have had negotiations and it's already employed and earning benefits, and I'm just feeling a ""general"" drop in hormones due to the shock loss of its sister ovary? Someone, please encourage me that this isn't going to be my story...early menopause at 33 before I've had the chance to have a baby with the love of my life?

I rang 111 today and they said I need to see a doctor ASAP and then an out of hours doctor called me and she basically shrugged me off and said my sick feeling is probably viral and may not be linked to my issue so she said to see how I am in a few days. Has anyone ever experienced something like this who could give any advice please? I'm really worried about what could be happening in there. Thanks in advance. 0 likes, 9 replies "
Ovarian Cyst,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/ovary-problems-bloating-and-first-gp-appointment-695609,"Ovary problems, bloating and first GP appointment","Hi. Sorry to launch straight off with a bunch of questions. I've had some unusual symptoms for a few months. The most troubling is needing to wee a lot. And I mean A LOT. Plus, the feeling that I'm not fully emptying my bladder. I had already decided that enough was enough and I should see a doctor. I would go to the toilet and then immediately after standing up I'd feel the urge to go again. I could go 20-40 times a day. Then I recalled I'd had some other vague symptoms too that I'd kind of overlooked and maybe I should mention that too. I've had some pelvic pain, bloating and heartburn. Lower back pain, hip pain on the same side, sometimes a dull ache on the right side after sex. And, come to think of it, I do feel full quickly these days. I do know I have some fluid in my peritoneal cavity from an MRI I had a year ago (looking for sacroiliitis due to lower back pain) which the radiologist reported was ""likely physiological"". I have a history of corpus luteum cysts. I've had IBS for 20 years so bloating isn't unusual for me, but this feels different. I wouldn't, however, say it was persistent in the sense of permanent. I feel it every day, but it's worse at certain times. I'm not overly worried about it at the moment, but I know I have a lot of symptoms of ovarian cancer. But I also know these are not very specific symptoms and I'm 40 and ovarian cancer is unlikely and it's much more likely to be something else. A friend of mine, only a few years older than me, died this time last year of ovarian cancer so I also know it's not entirely outside the realms of possibility. So I'd be interested to know how to go about talking to my doctor about this and how to make sure ovarian cancer is ruled out. I have no idea what to expect. How do I make sure nothing is missed? Does anyone know what might happen when I see my GP next week? How do I know if my GP has covered everything? Thank you for any advice you can give. 0 likes, 2 replies "

Ovarian Cyst,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/joint-pain-after-unilateral-oophorectomy--698769,Joint Pain after Unilateral Oophorectomy?,"Ive been going through quite a nightmare dealing with 2 ovarian cysts. Took a misdiagnosis from my pcp who said it was just constipation, 3 days later an er trip where they figured it out but wouldnt do anything until it was in torsion (and then deemed am emergency worthy thing) but referred me to my gyno and recommended surgery, 2 days later a gyno visit where she said its fine and itll go away on its own cause she didnt like doing surgery, and 3 days after that another trip to the er for them to send me to emergency surgery for ovarian torsion. They removed my right ovary after discovering that the grapefruit-sized cyst (that was completely blocking off my organs and keeping me from being able to go to the bathroom at all, and keeping me from eating or drinking because Id just throw it up soon after) was infact in torsion, and per the er surgeon had been for so long that my ovary was completely necrotic. They left the cyst on the other side, and Ive been feeling horrible ever since. I just hit 2 weeks out from surgery and along with extreme stomach cramps, difficulty going to the bathroom still, and my main incision splitting and becoming mildly infected (which my gyno said isnt, but sure seems that way due to the redness around it, pain it causes me, and extreme foaming when I have to clean it with peroxide), Im experiencing daily headaches and body pain that I have difficulty describing. I want to say its joint pain, but I dont know? it wakes me up at night and its agony. Its not a screaming outloud crying pain, but its like a screaming bloody murder inside my head. Like my body is on fire but its not. Its not stabbing, but its not dull. Ive thought and thought about it and the best I can come up with is like my body is trying to tear itself apart from the inside. Its in my shoulders and neck, my hands and feet, my elbows, my arms.. It moves around. Last night it was just my right arm at my shoulder joint, tonight it is both shoulders and my neck. I feel nauseous and weird, and its absolutely horrible. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  Its absolutely agonizing, Im so tired and I cannot sleep, or if I do its only for a few hours before this bizarre nightmare wakes me up.

A week or so later i went to my local hospital to find i was leaving around 250 ml in my bladder so had to start catheterisation  but infection,and a bad one at that, followed. so my query is before i finally see the consultant,they have booked me in on Monday as the junior Dr said i have been messed about enough, have i been operated on unnecessarily?? the consultant also wanted to do a clam augmentation op on my bladder which i argued with a bit of help from google that my symptoms did not merit such a procedure which he agreed to not do the op so he has form with wanting me to cut me up!! any help greatly appreciated 0 likes, 0 replies "

Is it normal for some people to feel kidney-associated pain in the very low part of the back? Or could it be that my kidneys are somehow placed lower than they should be? 0 likes, 2 replies "

Please excuse the fact that I dont know all the proper names for all the tests and such, but she has had blood tests, ultrasounds, live CT/X-ray thing to check urinary tract functions,  something where they filled her bladder up with fluids for some flow check, etc., etc. She doesn't always tell me things, but she talks to her mom and then I hear about it. My daughter is tired of the same tests over and over. I am tired of seeing her in pain all the time. She just had a blood panel done and everything is in normal ranges. Kidney and liver were normal. I was hoping someone out there may have some insight or information about what else may be causing her to have so much pain so often. Thank you for taking the time to hear me out.

Kidney Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/angiomyolipoma-652742,angiomyolipoma,"Hi there! I was diagnosed with a 4.6 bi-lobed tumour on my left kidney at the end February 2018 --  a few weeks ago.  It was discovered by CT scan whilst looking for colon cancer. The bi-lobed tumour was thought to  be a renal cell carcinoma-- renal cancer. It was growing right through the middle of my kidney and out of the top, and because of the position of tumour and its size, I was advised that the only safe treatment was a total radical  nephrectomy -- to have my whole left kidney removed.  I was and still am very upset about the loss of my precious left kidney, but relieved that this potentially dangerous tumour is out.( I am using homeopathic remedies for feeling violated, anger and grief at due to the surgery, as well as homeopathic remedies for post -srgery recovery -- which are really helping me.)  I had the radical nephrectomy on 27th March -- still described as an RCC -- at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford (specialist cancer hospital). The histology report shows that my tumour was in fact an Angiomyolipoma  -- and not cancer at all. Whilst it's a relief not to have cancer, I am aware that these so called benign tumours can also be fatal if they cause the kidney to rupture. I am concerned that I will develop another  angiomyolipoma on either my only remaining kidney or on another organ. Has anyone here had this happen -- a second angiomyolipoma develop if they are not a Tuberous Sclerosis patient?  I understand that these tumours are cause by a mutation in the TSC2 gene. I am assured by my consultant that I do not have TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS (TS).  However, this gene mutation can cause angiomyolipomas to occur in my other precious kidney, or on another organ. What has other people's experience been? I'm terrified that I will develop another angiomyolipoma, and that it won't be discovered early enough to avoid loosing my other precious kidney.  Has anyone had this happen to them? Does anyone know the statistics on the chances of developing  a second or more angiomyolipma tumours for non TS patients? Thanks for your help!

Kidney Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-am-having-strange-symptoms-could-it-be-my-kidneys--689116,"I am having strange symptoms, could it be my kidneys?","About a month ago I started getting random bouts of extreme itchiness. This itchiness absolutely could not be ignored. It didn't come with a rash or hives and there was no consistent trigger. My GP put me on a anti-histamine which hasn't helped. I also started having cloudy urine. Sometimes its just a little cloudy, sometimes its completely opaque and you can't see the bottom of the toilet bowl through it. It isn't affected by how much water I drink, and it isn't overly dark in color either. I have also been having trouble with healing. I had a small cut that took over a week to heal and left a disproportionate scar. I also have a bruise that hadn't improved at all in almost 2 weeks. All this culminated in an awful experience I had yesterday. I went to hospital for a pelvic ultrasound to investigate chronic pelvic pain I have. I arrived with a full bladder as instructed, and because the department was running behind, I was made to wait over 40 minutes for the scan. By the time they called me back, I was in extreme pain, both in my bladder and deep in my mid back (like kidney pain).  I was unable to lay still for the scan and I almost fainted from the pain. After I was allowed to relieve myself, the back pain continued for about half an hour. Now, I have had to hold my bladder many times. I am known for needing to pee often and on road trips and such this often means I need to hold my bladder to very uncomfortable levels. But I have never experienced anything like this. It was severe pain, the worst I have ever felt, and it wasn't immediately resolved when I was allowed to pee. Could all these symptoms be related? Could they point to a problem with the kidneys? For background, I am currently seeing specialists for chronic  ,  , and pelvic pain, and I am being treated for migraines. Could these new symptoms point to a new problem with my kidneys?

Over the course of the last 3 or 4 months I've noticed an increased 'kidney ache' the day after I've consumed a large quantity of alcohol.  The pain would only last as long as my hangover, i.e. the day after.   At the time this wasn't of particular concern and I simply put it down to the excess drinking alone without worry.  However at home last night I consumed a single casual pint of lager and noticed that my kidneys immediately started hurting.  The pain lasted through the night and I am still aware of it this morning.  I am particularly concerned given that a) the aching started immediately after consuming the alcohol (as opposed to the day after) and b) that it was triggered but such a small quantity of alcohol. The pain wasn't/isn't significant enough to stop me going about my normal business, I would describe it as a constant dull ache emanating from my lower back at both sides (note its definitely not one sided).  It is however enough to cause me discomfort and did disturb my sleep moderately. To give some further background, I am a 33 year old white male.  There is no family history of kidney problems.  I drink a lot of water on a daily basis as I don't drink much tea or coffee.  In a normal week I probably consume about 4 or 5 pints of lager.  However in addition to this I would say I also binge drink once every 3 weeks, on average consuming 7 pints or 4 pints and 3 double mixers. I am uncertain whether this is cause for concern and I'm not sure whether I should continue to drink alcohol (I'm supposed to be going out for a birthday party tomorrow night).  I will probably make an appointment with my doctor for next week.  Does anyone have any advice or shared experience?  0 likes, 19 replies "

I had my first kidney stone a year ago that was large and it had to be treated with a lithotripsy, so this was my first experience with ""passing"" one. The nurses agreed it looked like I was passing a stone, but the doctor was not convinced.

I insisted on a CT scan because this was not ordinary pain. I didn't feel any relief until dilauded was administered. So I got my CT scan and sure enough, there are stones.

I go home at 5am and over the next 6 hours, I pass 4 stones that are each 3mm. I'm totally confused. Are these stones that were already in my bladder and not mentioned to me? Did the CT scan miss two of them? Do I still have two coming? Can a CT scan miss stones?

The pain was so excruciating that i could not stand sit or do anything I was groaning and pacing and rocking back and forth. The ED staff gave me some pain killers which was useless as i vomitted them up a few seconds later,I was nauseas the whole time. I was left there like that for 4 hours. When i finally got in i was put on a bed and given more pain killers which again i vomitted up. Finally i was sent for a CT scan and they found a 18mm stone in my uterer and another slighly smaller stone in my kidney. By this time i could not think with the pain and was nearly passing out. Then they fnally gave me pain relief through my IV and within 5 minutes it was bearable, why could they not have done this earlier? I was admitted to hospital to get a stint put in but that got delayed until the following day. Because of this i then had to endure round two of the pain. Later in the afternoon the pain came back with vengeance, i was still nuances and unable to keep anything down so they gave me morphine in the stomach which did not work. I told them what helped last time but they were unable to give me pain relief through the IV in the ward, isn't this a hospital? I then became septic, which ended up a blessing because i was delirious with the fever and don't remember much after that time but when i came to again the pain was gone. I spent the rest of that night and the next morning lying on my back too scared to move incase the severe pain came back again. I got the stint put in and was sent home the day after. They were going to send me back to work the day after that but i said there was no way i could do my job the next day so they gave me one extra day off. I am now at home, alone and feel terrible, i still feel nausea and am having trouble eating. I have to do everything myself but have no energy and am unable to concentrate on anything. My left side is still very sore and when i go to the toilet i get sever kidney pain and cramps in my back and bladder area, i dread having to go. I am suppose to go back to work tomorrow which won't be happening. I have 4 weeks to wait for the stones to be removed, will i be like this for the whole time? I have always been fit and active and now feel like i have aged 10 years in a few days and do not feel very confident.  Have other people had the same issues after the stint is in and they have been sent home?  0 likes, 10 replies "
Kidney Stones,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/hi-again-677537,"Hi, again ","I had a lower pole kidney stone lasered 6.5 weeks ago ( the most painful experience of my life ) I have been in and out of hospital 4 times since with infections, bleeding etc .. Last Monday I was phoned to say there was a cancellation and could I make it to get my stent removed .. I watched the procedure on camera as it went into my bladder and within 5 weeks the entire stent was crusted over...  The urologist tried everything to remove it and break off bits ( remembering I had only had anaesthetic gel in my ureter) no pain meds ..  Long story short  he got a bit out my penis but it was firmly lodged in my kidney so he tried pushing it back ... no luck !  I was told to dress  with oart of the stent protruding and they took me for xrays and then on to a ward ..  a nurse gave me doclofenac suppositiries for pain. 5 minutes later a different urologist said he had looked at the xrays and could he see the stent, so I showed him and he promptly began pulling at the stent until such time as it came out. I had no lube or other medication and was in shock ... his only words afterwards were to drink water and have a seat  I was sent home without anymore info ...  On Friday 4 days later I was battling to urinate and my stream was down to a trickle i was in the most extreme pain and knew the bits in my bladder off the catheter may be causing problems.. I endured horrific pain fir a fee hours and thankfully my diclofenac worked it's miracles  yet again for the pain.   About 2.5 hours later while urinating I had the most awful feeling of pressure  and gave birth to a 1.5 cm stone .

Kidney Stones,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/finally-some-good-news-for-me-686937,Finally Some Good News For Me,"Firstly, this is   an attempt to gloat here.  I'm all too aware from years of suffering that I'll never be completely in the clear with  ,  .  But I   had a rough going in the last few years, and this forum  can be rough reading for those of us who suffer from them. So in the hope of raising some spirits, I thought I'd share some of my recent good fortune. I  had my one-year return appointment with my urologist last week and received an ""All Clear"" from him. Images were taken of my kidneys prior to the apointment, and they only showed traces of microscopic stones which he feels should easily pass on their own. The urine sample I provided showed no traces of blood or any high content of minerals. The doctor said something along the lines of "" "" and that said he'd see me in a year. Needless to say it was a relief to hear this. A year ago at this time I was preparing for ureteroscopic surgery to remove a 6mm sized stone. The immediate post-surgical experience was painful (primarily when I had to urinate), and that damn stent I had to have inside for two weeks and a day was a miserable experience. Over the course of the last year I made my most concerted effort yet to lower the amount of  oxalates in my diet. I'd done this in previous years too, but I always seemed to fall off the wagon after a few weeks/months. This time I made it a major part of my daily routine. I also dramatically cut my sodium intake -- this is hard to do because I   (past tense!) a huge lover of salty snacks, especially at night.  And, of course, I've made a more determined effort to increase my water intake all day long. I still need to be better about this, but I'm better about it than in any previous period of my life. The only other change in the last year is that the urologist prescribed Urocit-K (potassium citrate) tablets after my surgery, and I've been taking it twice a day ever since. I'll continue to take them going forward too. It had been previously prescribed from about age 35 to 45 , and I remember it being pretty effective then too. But when a former GP changed my blood pressure medication to Losartan -- which already contains a fair amount of potassium -- I was taken off of Urocit-K.  I now take Amlodopine for high blood pressure, however, so that interaction is no longer an issue. I know some question whether potassium citrate is really all that effective against the production of stones. I suppose like so many other things, it probably depends on the individual. I'm going to simply believe that it does help me. The co-pay for a 30 day supply with my insurance is fortunately only $10. I am 59 years old. I had my first kidney stone at 25 and have had at least four surgeries to remove the larger ones. I can't even begin to guess at the number of smaller ones I've passed with awful pain. My vigilance with the diet and water will continue unabated. This will always be a lifetime struggle for me. But it was nice to have had a stone-free year, and I sure as hell hope I can continue that for a while. I wish the same for all of you. Keep the faith! 0 likes, 6 replies "

The prior surgery was thirty months ago and I kept notes from the rehab journey in anticipation of this upcoming procedure. My surgery planning or ""prehab"" is as follows: lose 5-10 pounds;  daily squats both chair type and wall; stairmaster for 20 minutes every other day;  weight exercises for both upper body and knees 3-4 times weekly; walk a mile daily with cane, as needed; and, proper nutrition (no salty, sweet snacks, or deserts;  more fresh fruits and veggies); and sleep.

Knee Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/when-should-i-get-tkr--698075,When should I get TKR?,"People keep asking me when I am going to get new knees?  I did homework and found out TKR is tricky.  Worse recovery than hip or heart surgery. My doctor says I am too young, that I will have to have it done again in ten years. He also say when you can't sleep or it is painful all the time that is when to get it done. I woke up 8 years ago not having full ROM in both knees and my quads hurt. I assume I pulled something. My job requires heavy lifting, pushing and standing. Never had a problem with my knees. Anyhow, first step was cortisone shots. That moved pain to medial part of the knee. I never noticed any swelling, ever. Although lab work say I do.  I have tried many thing and no change. Abstaining weeks away from certain foods and eating only certain foods, acupuncture,  Rhus Tox, ice, heat, rest, yoga, DMSO, WD40, dandelions, onions, fish oil, Vitman D3, TENS unit... I even got fire ants to sting me 60 plus times on one knee. NO CHANGE, ZERO! I hobble around and make do. Wear Breg Freestyle braces and sit whenever possible. I sort of adapted. At rest I have no pain. Lifting and pushing are way less painful than running or standing.  Honestly I am not totally convinced it is OA causing the problem. Reason being, I was rear ended about 4 years ago and as a preventive measure I got neck x rays. Doctor said I had spurs, OA that is was a mess. My neck feels fine and always has. They say the same about my knees.  I did get checked for RA since my father was diagnose with it in the 70s. Test were not absolute so i was tested for Sclera Derma and Marfans. Those were not thrown out but was not likely I had those. time line of ailment are as follows. Woke up 10 years ago with lower back issues. Hurts when I bend over in one area. Then followed by Plantar faciatis and sciatica (1 time for about a month). Knees followed by feeling of being in a cloud, fog 5 years later. This led to getting my crystals checked (didn't know people had such), MRI of head, chest and torso. I do have a leaky heart valve,  slightly enlarged lower ascending aorta and a meandering pancreatic duct. No real concern there other than keeping an eye on it. I mention these thing just in case there might be a connection to my knee pain. My plan is to put surgery off until i can walk at all. Am I a fool for not just biting the bullet and have surgery. Any input would be grateful. Thanks. 0 likes, 7 replies "

I found it by chance a week or so ago and it has definitely been encouraging, however, having said that… LOL I am six weeks out from TKR and definitely wishing I never did this. I absolutely have more pain now than I ever did prior to the surgery. I was getting injections for the pain and they did help, although I walked with a limp for the last three years after a failed  meniscus surgery. Anyway, I guess I am fortunate because I stopped walking with a walker or cane within 10 days of surgery, I have been driving since three weeks out, and generally walking isn’t too bad. But don’t get me wrong, I am living with severe pain. I have been taking Percocet since surgery (but of course I do not take them if I know I’m going to be driving).  keep thinking I’m going back to work  (I'm  A real estate broker so I can make my own hours )  but then morning comes and I just don’t feel up to it, between my knee and my head (emotions...) My range of motion is OK, I guess, for my timeline. I am past 90° on the bend and have been from the beginning, but it changes daily. And I still cannot straighten my leg all the way. I am very swollen and stiff and have sharp pains on the sides of my knee, especially the outside. Sleeping is impossible with pain meds. . I feel like I am  going to be one of those who doesn’t fully recover though,  which I think is in my head because of the failed meniscus surgery. The thought of having pain for months on end is really depressing. And let’s not even talk about how the lower back hurts from everything else going on.  I'm 59 and was very active prior to my original knee injury 3 1/2 years ago  but it just seems that life will never be the same. I’m dealing with all the   everyone goes through too. I hate being such a whiner but I’m glad I have this board where at least someone can understand.  if I had known what a long process this was, I don’t think I would have done it. As it was, right up into surgery I kept saying I didn’t want to do it. I am not normally a negative person but that sure brings the negative out in me .  I guess right now I am just venting to cyberspace but it’s good to know there are people out there who understand this journey better than I do . 0 likes, 35 replies "

The therapist said there was nothing he could do for me that I couldn't do at home.  My ROM after 3 weeks was 120!

My knee is a lot better - I can now bend it and I know it will weight bear because my physio has me doing exercises standing on my operated leg. My problem is with stairs. I am just about managing to get up the stairs one foot after the other - something I haven't been able to do for years due to the pain. But it's so hard, and my knee aches so much afterwards I get so disheartened. Coming down is a different matter. I use a step at physio and I'm now able to go straight on and off the other side in a totally natural movement, bending my operated knee. But the stairs are so much deeper than the step, and I just can't bend my knee enough to make it down the stairs - even using a crutch and the handrail, and doing it slowly so I don't fall (which is what scares me). I'm still in a fair amount of discomfort most of the time, and have stopped taking pain meds as they made me feel nauseous. Any one else had a similar problem?

Lets visit the Hurt Scale,"It seems an appropriate time, four days after a full revision to take a look at the 'hurt scale'. One unit shall be known as a Hurtz..... Any feedback most welcome. 22 months after my first (there wont be a second) TKR I went in last Friday for the procedure. A 'revision' for those who may not know, is starting again.  All the bits that went in the first time are consigned to a bucket using an array of drills and hammers, (as its not supposed to come out) and new stuff inserted deeper into the bones to get some purchase ! Ouch indeed.... I thought (and Im sure Im not alone) that pre-tkr, I had reached 10 out of 10 on the hurt scale. Indeed I had that very conversation with the surgeon and as a result went ahead with the procedure.  People told me (even some I trusted) that there was pain beyond 10 Hurtz, but as Id already peaked at 10 (for some years), I wasnt able to comprehend such numbers, so dismissed them as fiction. The ramblings of fools and scaremongers! I then had the TKR and realised there were a further 10 levels of hurt (at least) available to me that I hadnt before considered possible. My first of 2 MUA's got me to around a mind-blowing 25 Hurtz on the recovery table (where I was quickly re-sedated to shut me up) and Im pretty sure Im back in the mid to late 20's after attempting a leg lift earlier, rolled towel under knee or not... Crikey it Hurtz.. Discuss... Having said that, its not too bad when resting. Much better than the first time despite the beating my leg has been through, so Im hopeful for a far better outcome. I slept last night pretty well, again better than last time. I dont have a dark blue upper leg and buttock as I did last time and no sign of the bruise around my thigh from the agricultural strapping. All in all, and I realise its very, very early days, Im reasonably (all things considered) happy. I just wish it didnt hurt so much. Im already at two and a half times (25 Hurtz) the pain that I was able imagine just 22 months ago and Im not sure its over just yet.

Anyway, I went to my eye doctor who found papiledema, so she sent me to the emergency room where I had an MRI and CT scan.

Knee Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/dealing-with-pain-and-depression-after-total-knee-replacement-549342,Dealing with pain and depression after total knee replacement,"Hi everyone! i was so happy to find this discussion group! I am 3 weeks post op after a total   on my right knee. The   has finally hit me. Never feeling pain free, not sleeping well at night, being dependent on someone else to get me to PT or grocery shop has really gotten me down. I'm not one to cry, but today the tears came pretty easy. I too have the burning that everyone here talks about. My physical therapist said that's the nerves that are healing. After doing my exercises I find it easier to walk with less of a limp, however it doesn't take long and my knee stiffens right up again. The hospital sent me home with this great ice machine so I'm not having to use ice packs like others have talked about. I just put 4 bottles of frozen water in this machine and then fill it with water up to the water line. Put the top back on and plug it in. It has tubing that runs from the machine to the pad that you strap to your leg with attached Velcro. The pad is shaped to form to your thigh right above the knee and the start of the calf right below the knee. This machine has been a blessing! Once the bottles thaw out, I exchange them with 4 frozen bottles from the freezer so I'm never without ice. The machine circulates that cold water constantly so you have and even amount going to your whole surgical area. Icing is great but sometimes I feel stiffer than if I don't use it at all. I'm taking Percocet for the pain and it helps to some degree but doesn't take all the pain away. I can't take codine, Vicodin or morphine because they make me so sick. But I'm wondering how all of you are dealing with the depression that comes along with all the pain? I'm a very independent person and not having any family that live close by makes me rely on one other person to run errands or take me to PT. I'm so tired of always sitting with my legs up or sleeping with a pillow between my knees so I can lay on my side at night. The lack of sleeping for more than an hour at night before the pain wakes me up and I get myself in another position to sleep is wearing on me. Can someone more than 3 weeks out of post op show me that there is light at the end of the tunnel?? So many people that I've talked to that had this done years ago say it's the best thing they've ever done. I'm certainly not feeling that way right now. If you asked me today if I'd do this again my answer would be absolutely not!!! But I'm sure weeks from now I'll feel totally different. Someone please tell me that I won't always regret doing this. I knew it was going to be a tough recovery, but I didn't realize that 3 weeks after surgery I'd still be feeling like this. I know I'm improving because I see the changes when I'm doing my exercises at home. Something that was so difficult a week and a half ago is much easier to do now. I guess I just want someone who's surgery is maybe 6 weeks out to say ""it does get better, this is how it is fir me now"". Something, anything positive. I'm happy I found this site and I pray I get a response to my posting. Good luck to all of you! I know we'll all make it through this tough process. Sue (from Wisconsin) 1 like, 78 replies "

The symptoms vary, with acute periods lasting a couple hours and occurring on a weekly basis. Generally an acute period is characterized by severe headaches, needing to lie down, blocked ears and extreme lethargy.  I have had CT’s and MRI’s of the brain and cervical spine, PET scans, ECHO’s, a multitude of blood tests and various other tests with no abnormalities.  I gym 4 times a week, eat healthy and work as a hairdresser, so my lifestyle is pretty healthy overall.  This condition is starting to limit my lifestyle and with two years of no answers I am putting it out there for someone to recognize or provide advice about what could potentially be going on!  Any feedback, even small, would be very much appreciated!  0 likes, 25 replies "
Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/iih-lost-focus-memory-and-concentration-597147,"IIH lost focus, memory and concentration","Hi, I am experiencing some difficulties between my pain, declining memory, and work/stress.  I'm going to share what I feel is happening, and I hope some of you have some wise words of previous experience to pass along.   I was diagnosed with migraines in 2009 and in 2014 my ophthalmologist noticed signs of papilledema and wrote a letter for me to take to my neurologist the following week suggesting a lumbar puncture. New diagnosis IIH. My neurologist believes I have a combination of migraine and iih.  Fortunately, my optic nerves are ok per my neuro-opthamogist, but I do experience blurred and double vision multiple times per week. My pain has grown exponentially and is tolerant of a lot of medications. I can no longer tell when a headache/migraine ends or begins. Triptans do nothing. Some things that help a bit are Migranol Nasal spray, fioricet, celebrex, reglan, zofran and valium. These help for a few hours to lessen intensity and then the pain returns full force. I am careful to avoid MOH. My pain gets to a point that I have to take steroids to bring it down a notch or go the the ER for an infusion. Recently I'm missing more work than I attend during the week. Last year, I was on medical leave for all of this stuff.  I tried like 50 meds, nerve blocks and trigger point injections every two weeks and botox every three months. I felt exceptional before returning to work (with the same company in a similar position.) In training I felt like I had forgotten a lot of things I used to know, but was progressing with new material and making the appropriate decisions probably 90% of the time.  About 3-4 months in I started feeling confused and overwhelmed by the material and getting mixed up on my decisions. I am getting work sent back to me at least 50-70% of the time because it is incorrect.  When I ask questions I am made to feel that I should have already know the answer and really don't get  clarification. Sometimes I feel like I am being picked on because I'm not getting it but it might be an internal judgement. My memory and concentration is in the toilet, and I can see that they are working on getting rid of me due to this. Bursts of extra coaching for like a week, then nothing, encouraging me to ask any questions I need, then next time I ask a question I should use my best judgement. Emails documenting what we went over in a coaching session. I get it, I'm not doing as well as everyone else, and due to what I believe is this illness and chronic pain I feel the check boxes are being ticked so I can be let go. I find bright lighting, overall pain, too much noise, heat and frustration tend to make me feel overwhelmed the most.  I think it keeps me from being able to focus my attention fully on anything. Concentration and memory don't work well at home either. I have to start every story with did I already tell you this? I have tried to talk to my husband about the decline and when it started, and he doesn't know. Then he told me we have this conversation every day.  I really am clueless about it.  I've packed my son the same lunch for days in a row with no variation like usual and had no idea when he told me.  I get mixed up in the shower about what I've washed, shaved etc and find myself doing it again to be sure. I have a shower routine that I normally do in order, and I couldn't tell you why I veer from it... I have had neurocognative testing done, that judges memory, attention, problem solving, language, visuospatial, processing speed motor, and emotion.  Basically my score across the board was average.   I sure do wish there was a baseline, because I was always a driven, straight A student.  I learned quickly at work and could be up and running within days to a week of training for what was expected to be a month long training session.  I mourn that person. I wouldn't have believed an average score previously... now I'm going well that the middle lol. So down to the real questions. Do you find your memory or concentration lacks? Any tips other than alarms, calendar,  sticky notes, etc?   Are you impacted on the job more than just attendance? What adjustments or accommodations have you or your workplace made to help you stay at work? What are some signs you knew you weren't going to be able to stay at work or in the same job anymore? How did you feel  when you first began to come to terms with it? How do you feel now after leaving or changing jobs?  What type of support have your received from your friends and family? What helped the most? Sometimes I feel so lost and helpless at 35 when people ask what I need and what they can do. Hearing your most appreciated support stories might help me to come to the right words. 2 likes, 12 replies "

I was having the worst head pain for about 2 months that would make me scream, cry and my vision would go in and out all day long until I would finally pass out. My husband didn't know what to do, my 2 boys were scared that they would loose me, and I couldn't care about anything.

Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/possible-iih-very-nervous-664734,Possible IIH?  Very nervous,"Hi.  I posted this in the neurological forum but think this may be a better place for it.  Please see below.  Thanks! Around 2 weeks ago, I was feeling totally fine and all of a sudden while walking, I experienced severe dizziness and a feeling of rocking back and forth.  I couldn’t stand up and had to lie down.  I went to urgent care who just did a basic blood test and gave me meclizine and said to see an ENT. I saw an ENT and they referred me to a balance clinic, couldn’t find anything wrong with my ear but said it’s possible for inner ear. Fast forward to three days ago and the dizziness and feeling of rocking is still ongoing everyday.  Three days ago I experienced weakness in my left side of the head, left arm, and right leg.  It could have been anxiety since I suffer from severe anxiety, so I didn’t go to the ER once it resolved. The following day, I saw an optometrist because I had noticed some blurry vision and misreading words often.  They said my optic nerve seemed swollen and sent me to an emergency opthomologist.  The opthomologist resident also ran tests that showed slight swelling but were inconclusive in terms of it being just optic nerve drusen.  They also sent me for MRI with and without contrast which came back normal except for saying that my optic nerve sheath was prominent in the imaging. Today I’m still feeling weak and offbalance.  My eyes also seem somewhat red on the sides.  Should I be concerned?  The opthomologist resident didn’t seem too concerned or knew what it was.  Would the MRI have shown if I had swelling or increased pressure in the brain?  I hate feeling this way but maybe someone knows what I might have.  Thank you.  I also have a pressure like sensation in the head most of the time, if that helps. 0 likes, 6 replies "

I was diagnosed with IIH in February. Since then it's been a rocky road of trying medication after medication with no relief of symptoms and a lot of side effects on top of a lot of pain and vision disturbances. Two months ago, my neurologist said he couldn't assist further. I have an appointment at John Hopkins with their team but it's a two month wait without any medication and I have one month left to go. In the mean time, I had a spinal tap last week which went badly on the doctor's part. My pressure was at 47 and they only took me down to 35. I'm in a lot of pain due to the pressure and can feel it rising again already. I struggle with wanting to go to the ER but because my spinal tap had complications, it feels pointless to get help at the ER. What could they really do to help? I'm just feeling like waiting without medication is torture but I don't know what else to do while I'm waiting to meet those doctors. It's so hard to get people to understand how painful it is and to not get the help you need quick enough. Any advice or just comforting words? I'm feeling a little alone in this. Much luck to my fellow IIH warriors. - Victoria 0 likes, 10 replies "
Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/iih-contraception--672279,IIH - contraception?,"Hello, I know this group is probably to discuss treatment and pain of IIH which is understandable. However, I was wondering what everyone uses in the form of contraception? When I was diagnosed I was taken off my pill and ‘unofficially’ told that it was likely this that had caused it, but there isn’t enough evidence and they couldn’t confidently say. They did make very clear that IIH is most commonly diagnosed recently with women on various birth control aids with that being the only link between us. They also told me that I was no longer allowed any contraceptive pill and that this is the same for other women with the condition that come through the hospital. I wasn’t given any guidance as to what I can use instead and I am not comfortable with only using condoms. I wondered if anyone has any advice at all or can tell me what they use? I’m assuming others have also been told of the link between the pill and IIH, if not I would please do some research as it is incredibly risky, a lot of women aren’t as lucky as to be diagnosed before it has reached very harmful consequences. I have seen that some websites suggest progesterone only pills are okay and that there is a link between the estrogen in the pill with the IIH. However, my doctor is very thorough and I’m sure he would’ve mentioned this if it was possible as I was quite concerned to be without it. I am 21 with my partner and children are not what we want yet, the risk is still there. Some suggest the mirena coil as it has little hormone but again, I have seen plenty of women also getting IIH with that. I’m a bit stuck with what to do, could some women please let me know what they use?  Thank you  0 likes, 0 replies "

The past two weeks have been pretty crazy to cap off the past year or so...I’d been progressively getting worse and worse headaches and even worse problems with  /vision loss. About a year ago I went to my PCP to tell them I’d been having troubles working out because I’d get dizzy and light headed. She told me I was probably just sensitive to being warm... Okay. So I went on, trying to do my best to keep myself cool while working out. Dizziness got worse. Vision loss started to be a problem. I though maybe I wasn’t eating right beefier working out or eating too soon...anything to explain the issue. Well, being 28 and not having vision insurance it didn’t cross my mind to go to the optometrist, but my mother made me go two weeks ago and low and behold both my optic nerves were severely swollen. So much so that the eye doctor personally called an ophthalmologist to make me an appointment immediately. So next morning I go to see him. Have a few tests done...he orders an MRI, an MRV, and a spinal tap, all to take place in the coming week.  The MRI and MRV were clear of tumors and any blood clots...so that’s the good news. I had the spinal tap on Monday and the hospital had me met with a neurologist the very next day because my pressure level was at 40mmHg...didn’t sound terrible until they told me what my normal should be (between 10 and 20)... So, the neurologist started me on Diamox immediately. I’ve been on it for four days... I’m not sure yet if I’m still having a bad reaction to the spinal tap or if this has moved into side effects from the medication, but I have had a SPLITTING   all week, haven’t been able to stand or sit up, even slightly reclined, for very long without getting nauseous along with a splitting headachend the only relief I get is if I’m laying completely horizontally with a pillow under my head. I’m currently on the floor at work in the back room with all the lights off because I was having a panic attack about almost throwing up... I was told the pain is from my brain relaxing after being under so much pressure for so long but what am I supposed do if I can’t even function long enough to be at work.  Thanks for reading...I’m just scared and I’m angry that no one took me seriously when I brought this up a year ago. It wouldn’t have been as bad as it is now if something was done about it when I told the doctor something didn’t feel right...  0 likes, 11 replies "

Nearly 3 years ago, I started having symptoms of nerve tingling up and down my arm. Eventually I had the headaches which of course lead to the nausea. I went to my GP a few times and they just said it's a common migraine or a virus and gave me some meds. A few days later, I was looking arouses and I was seeing double. It got worse and worse throughout the day. The next few days it was permanent.  At this moment I had double vision, headaches, nerve pains and nausea. I went to my GP again and he suggested I see a neurologist. Unfortunately, it was extremely difficult to see one as it was the holiday period and all the doctors were away.  Eventually I was able to find a neurosurgeon and was immediately admitted to hospital where I had a million blood tests, brain tests, MRI and others. They were eventually able to diagnose me with IIH and was immediately put into diamox.  Diamox:  Let me just say that this is prohibited the most horrible medication I've known. Yes it's worth it because I took away all my pain and symptoms. But the diamox had symptoms of its own. I experienced numbness, pins and needles, loss of appetite, weakness, etc.  With the condition, it also caused severe pressure on my eyes. The nerves of my eyes became weak and damaged, that they actually became scew.  I saw my opthalmologist and neurologist back and forth every 2-3 months. I've been on the diamox now for exactly 2 and a half years. Today I took my last tablet and I'll be seeing my doctor's for my final check-up in a month! Extras: For me, there the condition was completely benign. I had no characteristics that would normally bee associated with the condition such as overweight etc.  I started with 250mg diamox twice a day and that was increased to 3x a day a me then 6x a day. So just imagine all the side effects of the meds!! As I got better the doctors finally decided to slowly taper down the diamox. And now I'm diamox free.  I was 16 when I got sick and I did have to miss a year of school because of all the symptoms and the anxiety of all that was happening.  I just wanted to share my story. I know I've definitely left a lot out as I'm currently writing this at 3am and I can't sleep!  Please ask questions if you're curious xx  Ruth 1 like, 4 replies "

Ive been so careful always since i was so ill to avoid anything hormonal but i was assured it was safe by three different GPs. I really want it removed now but once again my GP says this is not a necessary concern as Progestogen is safe for me anyway & the hormone only is localised.  I wondered if anyone here might be able to give me any advice as to whether Mirena could be a contributary factor in IIH? My gut instinct is telling me to have it taken out asap.

Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/painless-head-throbbing-when-lying-down-491708,Painless head throbbing when lying down,"I'm 68 and have had painless head throbbing in the top, back and sides of my head which either wakes me up at night or in the morning. This has been going on for the past 7 months and no doctor seems to know what it is.  I am afraid they think I am crazy, but what I feel is real, and I simply don't feel well for hours after waking.  My head feels full when I lean over.  I have an occasional  , but it does not occur in the back or top or side of my head, only in temples or sinus area and is not connected with the throbbing.  The headaches seem to be connected with sleeping wrong and waking with a stiff neck.  It is not a migrane as there is no pain, no aura and occurs only after I have been lying down. This is complicated by the fact I have had BPV and   for 20 years so doctors blame one thing or the other. I sometimes have sinus/allergy issues, but I know the difference and this is not sinus.  I wake up in the morning feeling groggy, ears ringing, tired and light headed (and scared).   I've had an MRI and MRA, both negative.  I was checked out by a neurologist, EENT doctor and a cardiologist and they found nothing.  My BP is on the low side so it is not hypertension.  I often wake up in the morning with a stiff or sore neck.  I have glaucoma and see the opthalmologist every 4 months with lots of tests and he has said nothing about any optic nerve problems for cerebral spinal fluid issues, etc. I sometimes take tramadol for back pain and timoptic for my glaucoma, also prevacid for reflux.  I've tries stopping them one by one to see if they are causing it.  They are not.  I am at my wits end.  I feel like this is serious but no one is giving me an explanation.

My trapezium was removed and I got the tendon wrapped in its place similar to the ""anchovy"" you've read about. So I'm about 8 weeks into recovery. The only real problem I had was pulling a tendon in my wrist/forearm a week or so ago (man, that was painful!). That's getting better now but I've started to get pain in my fingers and thumb when I try to use them. Little things that I could do two weeks ago with no pain, like buttoning clothing, or opening a prescription bottle are pretty difficult.   From what I've read over the past few days on this forum, this doesn't seem unheard of but I admit it worries me/freaks me out a little. My surgeon was great, but they never seem to tell you of aches and pains and weirdness that you might expect over recovery.  Like many others, I was told by my surgeon that 12 weeks was the ""good to go"" point, but I think in ""surgeon talk"" he meant that's when the tendons heal with the bone, but forgot to mention thing like pain in other areas.  These days my hand and fingers hurt throughout the day, like achy and hard to move around. Very stiff. I never had that before my surgery, so I'm hoping it's just part of the healing process.  I'm curious to hear from people who's have similar issues and how long they took/are taking to feel better.  Thanks, all.

Just getting nervous, because the week of July 4th after a camping trip I was admitted to the hospital with osteomyelitis of the calcaneus (and possibly according to the MRI) the talus.  I spent almost 3 weeks in the hospital having a debrediedment of the bottom of my foot and back of my ankle/heel, and IV antibiotics.  I was sent home on oral antibiotics for another 4 weeks. At first I was able to walk with a limo and a little pain, fast forward to 2 months ago and I'm in excruciating pain and can no longer walk without crutches. After finally getting some insurance together an xray showed some possible bone softening a month ago in the ER and I finally have an MRI scheduled for 2 days from now. I'm nervous that I may still have om, but in a way will be relieved because then I know what is going on...and the treatment that will follow, probably another few weeks in the hospital for antibiotics and possibly surgery, BUT if not...then what?! I've been waiting 2 months already for insurance to clear so I can get treated for this, I guess I just needed to vent a little because no one else can understand what I'm going through. I'm a scrub nurse so the idea of being in the hospital and surgery don't bother me, lol it's the not being able to walk or bear weight for 2 months is killing me, and if it's not om, well then it's like I'll have to start this over.

A quick re cap is that I have been heavily dependant on opiates for over 10 years. I suffer from a chronic pain disease and have surgical procedures every 6 weeks under general anaesthetic.  This resulting in me taking strong opiates on a constant basis. I have tried many times to taper and every time has been awful. I get to a couple of days and then end up giving up and taking more again.   This time last year I was taking around 450mg - 500mg a day at the worst times. Even on this amount I felt as if I needed more! All of this was prescribed by my GP I must add.  My health has deteriorated significantly in the past 5 years since I have been taking Oxycontin rather than Tramadol. I have started the early menopause, been losing a lot of weight, extremly depressed and anxious, zero sex drive, no motivation to do anything like I used to and things I used to enjoy I have absolutely no desire to do anymore. In the back of my mind I have always thought that it is the Opiates that have been causing the problems, however medical professionals have always thought differently and in a lot of cases prescribed me higher does for the conditions I have been complaining about. Along with a concoction of other medications. I truly was stuck in a rut with it all and a few weeks ago decided that enough was enough and no matter what I was getting off these demon pills that control my life. I decided to stick with the 10% a month reduction rule, but I felt I needed to do a more drastic taper as I could still feel the 'good' effects of the Oxy on that dose. I wanted to feel normal but never high so I reduced it to 10% a week. I went through every withdrawal you can think of for the first 2 weeks and was craving the Oxy so bad it was all I thought about. I started a diary of every hour of the day just making little points about how I felt. This really helped me to notice a progress in where I was going and how much better I was feeling. I make a point of doing at least 3 things that are good for me every day. Yoga Meditation Exercise Walking the dog Reading a book Watching a funny movie Playing with my kids Plus whatever else I felt would boost my mood. Even when I really didn't feel any motivation and the sweat was dripping off me, I pushed myself to do at least one thing. I also work full time, thankfully from home. So I took a couple of weeks off work to try and get over the worst of it.  I havent completely stopped and it really is a work in progress, but I can't believe how much better I feel. What I find incredible is that the less I take the less anxiety and depression I have. I'm now taking 80mg a day and continuing to taper at 10-20% taper a week. If anyone out there is in the same position as I was and really knows they need to taper but can't stand the withdrawal please do it, you'll feel so much better for it.    0 likes, 2 replies "

I read some time ago that heroin addicts were prone to having a B12 deficiency due to all the heroin use over many years.  I was addicted to a stupid amount of Oxycontin (1500mgs) per day over around 9years but managed to quit & haven't had any Oxycontin now since August 2016. I was given 115mils per day of methadone to stop withdrawals which I've now reduced to 30 miles per day & hope to be completely free of methadone by the end of this year.  It hasn't been plain sailing, depression, anxiety, vision problems, heart palpitations, feeling dizzy, no energy, no enjoyment in things I used to enjoy, not sleeping plus loads of other things etc etc etc!! I had a full blood count blood test last week & it showed up a B12 deficiency, along with borderline anaemic, thyroid issues etc. So I had those specific blood tests again today.  What I wanna know is, from what I've read, I'm not surprised I'm B12 deficiencent, is this linked to the Oxycontin which I'm presuming it is & also will that account for the anaemia & thyroid issue also, again I'm guessing it is??? The nurse said if I do have B12 deficiency & have the injections to help, the change is incredible & she's had people saying they feel alive again.  All I'm asking I suppose is, which I guess it is (but the professionals will never admit it!!!) Are these issues I'm now having all linked to the many years of od'ing on the Oxycontin??

Opiates And Opioids,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/how-to-give-up-opieates-with-very-little-withdrawal-syndrome-642489,How to give up opieates with very little withdrawal syndrome ,"Hi all, firstly please don't attempt this on your own please involve your GP this method seems to work for all opieates, (for the search engines heroin, oxycontin, morphine, dyhidrocodine or codeine)  I've been dependent on dyhidrocodine and oxycontin off and on (but mostly on   for 10 years. I have given them up twice before, first time totally cold turkey which was absolute hell but my Dr put me on pregabalin (pregabalin has been tested up to 8000mg in a single dose without any damage to the tester, but bet he was off his nut lol. It will make you feel a bit drunk so I would recommend not going to work, NOT DRIVING,  and stay in bed for the 5 days or so this will take) for another reason and I found it releleaved the snake bones, itchy joints and the jerks (from here on called the heeby geebies) . Your going to need fairly high doses well well beyond what NICE (UK) recommend, I've read that some clinics in the US use it(they say 1200mg but that I'll blow you away) . I found 900mg every three hours is about what you are going to need, but your milage will vary as I am 160kg (22 stone)  and you may get away with less, best bet would be wait for the heeby geebies to start and take one (300mg) if that doesn't help after 20mins take another etc..this will find your needed dosage. The heeby geebies for me return after 3 hours at which point I take another dose. I would recommend not pre-empting the onset of the heeby geebies as towards the end they seem to become less frequent and severe. Pregabalin is expensive, its about £250 a box of 56 on a private prescription and may not quite be enough I was lucky living in the UK and having a awesome and very understanding GP (General Doctor) who prescribed what I needed under the UKs NHS... Your milage may vary..  I truly hope this helps some folks. Best of luck, its still not easy but the flu like symptoms are  a lot easier to deal (and much reduced on pregabalin, just got a stuffy nose and aches and pains this time)  with than the heeby geebies you get at the start, I was  flipping between the oxy and the DHC  100mg of oxygen a day and 120mg of DHC (to stop the withdrawal from the DHC being) g a tri acting opiate or 400mg/day of DHC that way I got far better pain relief as my tolerence would drop for the oxy (a single acting opieate) a while taking the DHC and vise versa I am told that due to the poor quality of street drugs I was doing about a 10 bag a day.. ) Anyhow I wish you all the very best breaking your dependence/addiction. Please post a comment if you have success with this procedure or have any questions.  Best of luck Jay 0 likes, 2 replies "

I had 4 cavities.  (I know this is a lot, I had put off dental work for some time and did not feel any pain from the cavities so I was unaware until I finally decided to get my teeth checked. I went to dentist #1, received fillings in two molars on the right side of my mouth.  No issues no pain. I moved, chose a new closer dentist, Dentist #2 filled a small cavity in the front, I loved the result.  No issues. Dentist #2 second appointment (issue with this one) The dentist left me with the assistant which was fine, but she began her work and struggled to put a metal piece between my teeth to fill a molar cavity, when she finally did,  , I felt an immense pain shoot in a straight line down my jaw toward my neck.  I flinched and clutched the chair. I have a high pain tolerance but I felt like puking from the intensity.  She said oh sorry your gums must be sensitive, but it wasn’t gum pain.  She walked away for a minute and I used my phone camera to check, the metal wasn’t near my gum.  It was shoved between my teeth, but not touching gum.  At the end she struggled to pull it out, and intense pain shot through my jaw in the same place.  I wanted to puke again. The dentist comes back in and asks for floss, he tries to floss between around the tooth she filled, and he can barely get it in there, because I have crowded tight teeth, I have the same issue when I floss.  She must have used a lot of force during her struggling to get that metal thing between my teeth, if floss can barely get in there. Now two days later I have jaw pain and swelling.  I don’t mean at the joint, I mean below where the molars are, where the shooting pain happened.  What could have happened? Should I be worried?    The intensity of the pain is why I am worried, especially since I have never had pain after a filling or even a root canal.  My gums are not in pain. 0 likes, 2 replies "

My cheek swelled up three times its usual size and took quite some time to deflate.  My dentist put me on a course of   for a couple weeks which did not do the job.  I went back and she prescribed something more powerful... Augmentin... which finally seemed to clear up the infection after another couple weeks. I got a root canal on the infected molar, had an extraction of the opposing upper molar (which was broken beyond repair) and then got a crown on the root canal tooth. All  of these things occurred over one week. (Root canal Friday, extraction 3 days later on Monday, crown another 3 days later on Thursday.) I was the last patient of the day when I got my crown and my dentist was in a hurry. She gave me an enormous shot of the numbing agent (I don't know if it was novocaine or something else) and injected it very quickly. Just stuck the needle in and squeezed everything out in about 2 seconds. My head started to spin moments later, I started shaking all over and lost the ability to speak. I very nearly passed out and her assistant ran and got me a drink of water. After a few minutes and a few sips of water, I felt better and she did the crown. It's been 8 days since then and I've had increasing  , disorientation and terrible headaches. Two nights ago, I got up from bed and immediately collapsed to the floor and started hyperventilating as the room spun around me. I thought I was dying. I was taken to the hospital in an ambulance where bloodwork was done. I had a very high white blood cell count but everything else was normal. I stayed for 5 hours, received fluids, some Benadryl and was released. Yesterday, I called my dentist and she said it doesn't sound like anything that would be the result of the crown. She thinks I have the flu. But all of this started literally right after the crown. I'm still dizzy and nauseous as I sit here and type this now. I can't stand too long on my feet without feeling like I'm going to topple over. Has anyone else ever heard of this? I don't know what to do! Please, if anyone has any advice or similar experiences, I would be very grateful to hear. I feel scared and nervous that there's something really wrong with me. Thank you, Sharon 0 likes, 1 reply "

These blisters in my mouth started 20+ years ago in an encounter that involved an exchange of saliva (kissing ) . Soon after that, I developed a Lesion on the underside of my tongue that was somewhat fleshy in color with a white crown .

In the ensuing years, I would continue to routinely get these lesions in my mouth in the soft fleshy areas (usually at the base of the mouth under the tongue , back of the throat , or occasionally inside of the cheeks ) . These lesions would sometime be flesh colored with white tops . Other times they would be as shown in these images . They never last more than a day or two  before they break open , drain , and feel almost as of nothing was ever there . Lately I've had one that is recurring in one location under my tongue in the soft areas at the base of the gums. It forms , last a day or two , then opens and drains and goes away for a few days .

It's quite hard to notice I think, I've had braces since and the orthodontist or dentist has never mentioned it.. I got so so anxious about it I finally made myself go to the doctor and got her to check it out, she said she wouldn't worry about it and that it's probably just a build up of tissue where the two palates meet so I decided to try and forget about it. Then the other day I knocked it again and noticed it, it's still pretty much the same as far as I can tell, maybe a teeeeeeny bit bigger but I'm not sure if that's just where I've been playing with it or what. Anyway now I'm terrified again. I'm not sure if it's because it takes loads for me to be reassured and she didn't seem all that experienced or the fact that I've had quite a bad experience with doctors in general because they give me so many different answers, but I've literally been panicking constantly to the point I can't sleep again even though she said it was fine. I've made an appointment with another doctor for a few days time to get a second opinion.. I'm scared for a few reasons - if he says its fine will I believe him? If he says its fine but then says to get it checked by a specialist to ease my mind I'm worried he'll just be saying that and thinking it is actually something serious and finally I'm worried he'll say to go and see someone because it is serious! ALSO because I've had it for years, what if it is serious and it's two late?! I read that only 50% of people with oral cancer survive past 5 years  I'm so so scared, I've got a little boy on the way and I just can't stop stressing over this but I'm worried even if it's fine I'm still not going to be reassured.

Oral and Dental Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/bad-breath-fart--402198,Bad breath(fart).,"So I've been experiencing BB for a few years now. Just like everyone else I've tried many things with no success. At first I thought it was my mouth but starting to believe it's something in my gut. I'm tired of getting ""did you fart?"" comments. Thing is I believe it's in my gut is because I've been suffering with bloating and passing gas all the time. So if I'm passing gas a lot and my breath smells like the exact same...there's got to be a connection. I notice it gets worse when my mouth is dry, which seems to be a lot of the time. Not sure that's due to my gut or because I'm always stressed/anxious around people and it dries my mouth out. Another thing is I think it may be linked to my MERCURY FILLINGS and wondering if anyone with BB here has fillings..? I've also noticed   that look like ringworms and uti's off and on. I went for a H Pylori test and waiting in results and I've been on the candida diet for about a month now and really not seeing a difference. Thing is I've not always had this. I've had many relationships and they were long lasting. It's hard to pin point the exact time when I started getting comments. Keep in mind it's been a handful only of comments, but those were enough to take precaution around people. I don't feel like it smells all the time, but when I exhale deeply or use certain letters like ""H"" and laughter. So please let me know if you have fillings, trying to find a connection. I know we can beat this. It's hard to function everyday, trust me I know. You can be handsome and rich and would t matter if you have fart breath. A mentally challenged person has better luck functioning in life than we do! I know talking helps, I've only briefly mentioned it to a doctor, but she was skeptical.

Ive never had the symptoms that most people get from having gall bladder removed- im the complete opposite (constipated)  Ive suffered with severe back problems for years but last 5 years its worse and have been classed as disabled recently. Due to medications i have to take and being unable to move about much let alone exercise  ive gained weight again and want to try orlistat again and hope for the best...... is it even worth trying...got 3 stone to loose Any advice will be gratefully received  Thankyou xx 0 likes, 4 replies "

I noticed a few years ago that my hips were different from those of my friends and those of any male I looked at after I noticed. To keep it short, my hips are basically identical to those of a female's. The bones stick out and they are wide. If you were to look at a comparison of male and female hips, mine are identical to those of the female. Before anyone suggests Kleinfelter's syndrome, I have no other symptoms of it. In fact, I have a very deep voice, a fair amount of body hair, a defined face, normal sized genitals, no breast tissue and I can easily build muscle. So it can't be low testosterone. They cause me serious self confidence issues and make me hate myself as well as being uncomfortable for lying down and using things like seatbelts because the bones stick out. If it is of any interest I am a twin to a female with down syndrome. It is seriously getting me down because no one I know of has the same issue and I just feel singled out and confused. Does anyone know why this could be, what I should do and if there is any cure at all? Thanks. 0 likes, 1 reply "

Moderate degenerative changes of the acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joints. No acute labral process is identified. 4. Tear and retraction of the long head of the biceps tendon I fully understand why she is not a candidate for surgery, but I was also told that the shoulder will continue to deteriorate and detach, at which time her arm will be fully out of the socket. Currently it is moving freely in and out of the socket. She was seen by an ortho Dr. but he recommended PT, but then did not provide any plan of care or images.  The Therapists still don't know what the objective was because they cannot do anything to help it heel (per my conversations with them). would anyone have feedback/ suggestions as to how I should move forward? I do believe we need a second opinion at the very least, only she is in the middle of Wyoming and there are 2 ortho doctors in the entire county and the one treating my mother has the longest medical history and he has graduated only 6 years ago.   0 likes, 0 replies "

I went to the doctor about 5 months ago as had a swelling around my lower left ribs since Christmas. It feels like either the bone is swollen, or the ribs are protruding due to something being swollen inside. It’s not painful, but can ache sometimes and feels a bit congested... like there’s inflammation in the area. The doc sent me for an ultrasound of my spleen and pancreas and a chest x ray, all fine. I was also sent for an endoscopy due to heartburn which showed a hiatus hernia and then I was sent for a lower chest, abdomen and pelvis ct scan due to pain in the area (assume caused by IBS). The ct scan showed a slightly bulky uterus and a slightly fatty liver. Still nothing shown for the rib swelling Doc then sent me for a nuclear bone scan which showed inflammation in lower left ribs - diagnosis of chostocondritis. Has anyone had this like me? With no stabbing pain? The doctor just said if I don’t have the severe pain I’m lucky, but I’m worried my diagnosis is wrong. My ribs seem so swollen in the area, they really stick out and it feels very hard when you touch it. It’s significantly larger in the evening. I’m worried it’s something else as I don’t have the normal symptoms. But I don’t really want to insist on more tests as I’m already convinced I’m going to get cancer from the nuclear bone scan, the ct scan and a previous ct scan I had years ago!

I have been having these really weird feelings in my head. Kind of like the room spinning feeling you'd get after one too many. Also if it's quiet and there's a loud noise it is like a firework has gone off in my head and takes me a few seconds to recognise what the noise was. And then there's the smells. For the past few months I have been smelling cigarette smoke. I put it down to assuming the neighbours were smoking near their window and I was noticing it due to being a new ex-smoker. However, over the last month or so I have been smelling a horrible burning smell. The best way to describe it is like the smell given off after a big fire has been put out and sometimes it's a smell of burnt hair or electrical burning. I didn't think anything of it apart from it being very annoying, but I mentioned it in passing to my GP last week (just the smell thingy). She said she wasn't sure about it and would need to speak to a colleague and get back to me. The next day she called to say she had sent a referral for a CT scan, but didn't give any indication as to what she thought the problem was. When I asked her what it could be all she said was that I needed to have the scan to rule things out? I try not to visit Dr Google as (I'm sure you're all aware) I end up convincing myself I have some rare exotic, incureable disease, but I received my appointment letter today for an appointment this Thursday and the sheer speed of it has scared the living daylights out of me, I usually have to wait months for any appointments. Sooooo, off to google I go and now I'm scared I have something sinister wrong with me - I avoid all things to do with the brain as it makes me feel physically sick, can't even look at drawn pictures of it - where as before the letter arrived I was content to think it was another symptom of EDS to add to all of the pain and fatigue. Sorry for sounding like a loon, but if there is anyone who can offer any sort of explanation and/or confirmation that EDS is behind this I will be very grateful Thanks guys   0 likes, 10 replies "

Orthopaedic Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/living-with-forestier-s-disease-31038,Living with Forestier's disease,"I have finally found info on Forestier's disease!! When I was first diagnosed back in 1988 my doctor had no material on this subject.  I was told to go home and find it on my computer, which I did.  There was a researcher in Canada who hit the nail right on the head, Forestier's is no pick nick! He was so right! When I was first diagnosed with the disease, I was in a lot of back pain. I had x-rays done and this article is correct....my vertebral area looked as if I were leaking wax.  I saw all sorts of bony hooks hanging from each and every vertebrate and I was in a lot of pain; but my doctor at that time said I couldn't be in pain, as it wasn't painful??? On the contrary, the article I was told to research stated that there is a great deal of pain associated with the disease and eventually it would be crippling and that is where I am, 20 years later. At the first time I was diagnosed, I didn't know that my choking could be associated with the disease itself, I thought it was just asthma...after all \""it isn't that bad.\"" I was placed on many anti-inflammatory medications. I was place on one that I suddenly would loose my speech and get confused...I was told they might be TIA's. Later this particular drug was found to do just that.  Since it wasn't helping, I was put on another anti-inflammatory and the doctor doubled the recommended dose and later I found that the sphincter muscle to my stomach and been burned away from too much of a good thing.   I was told not to see a chiropractor and for good reason! I had a complication from a surgery and they had to knock me out in order to go down my throat....while under someone turned my head further than I could myself and broke a facet in my neck; now I have plates in my neck and need more surgery....Once my neck was repaired, I didn't choke any longer.  Right now, the disease has gotten so bad that I have many areas of stenosis and nerve root cut off.  The neurosurgeon who performed my first neck surgery stated that every opening that allows the nerve roots to channel through my body was loaded with razor sharp spurs. This is just the spinal region of my body. I am beginning to calcify at every ligament insertion site.  I have bony over growth in my feet, which interfere with the articulation of my foot joints. I can feel the bones sticking out of my ankles and the tops of my feet; I'm beginning to fuse in my left foot.  In three weeks I'm heading for a double knee replacement because my left knee can't support my knee cap; over growth of bone has pushed it away.  It is getting more and more difficult to participate in daily activities as my range of motion is becoming limited. My elbows and my shoulders are affected as well...I can feel bony growth there as well. I'm losing feeling in my legs, as my nerves are being pinched; the pain shoots down to my feet and it is gripping. My hands can't grip a phone for any length of time. I found if my pain can be controlled, I can function well, but too many doctors are not up on the pain this disease produces.  Controlling the pain  keeps me moving, and that is what you need to do, but the support isn't there for this.  The disease is so rare that it is brushed off as regular osteoarthritis and it isn't, it's no where near the same.   I was diagnosed in my thirties and I have lived with chronic pain for over twenty years now.  I was told that it affects mostly males over the age of 70....bunk! It is genetic, as my mother had it and wasn't properly diagnosed with the disease and my brother has it as well.  My mother and I were deeply affected, she had it her feet as well and by the time she reached 70, she couldn't walk without crying in despair. I had one doctor treat me with Suboxone and it was the only drug that gave me back the quality of life others enjoyed.  He left for the north and I am back in severe pain once again. The problem with this disease, it's a square peg and everyone wants to fit into a round hole. I try to keep a smile on my face for my families sake, but the pain can be read all over my face.  I'm still young, by today's standards and I just want to be a participant in this life, not stuck in some corner watching my life and the world go passed me. 12 likes, 208 replies "

So I'm 16,  5'10 and i weigh 122 lbs. I have always been on the skinny side, I have talked to my doctor many times and I am a pretty healthy person, I am just pretty skinny for my age/height. I am sticking to a good diet plan+workout routine now and working to get my weight up. My problem is that i have a crooked body structure. As you can see in the pictures, the right side of my waist goes inwards when i stand straight, and my left side is mostly straight. I am not sure whether this is a waist structure problem or whatever you call it, but it interferes with my walking. Whenever i step with my right foot, my entire torso leans to the right, same thing with my left side except that i lean alot more when i step with my right foot because as i mentioned and you can see in the attached photo  , my right waist is more inwards than the left. Now because of that i sway side to side, swaying more to my right side than my left. People ask me why i walk like that and i guess i finally figured why. The thing about this is, i only realized that my torso is crooked when i actually took a picture of myself head on. Otherwise i never could tell i was standing crooked.  Also it is not just my waist but you can also see that my right chest is lower than my left, and my collar bones are not lined up. It's crazy because i really never would have known unless i took this picture. At first i thought it was just my waist, but now visually i see the crookedness of my chest and collarbone.  So can someone please tell me what exactly the problem is, and how i can fix it. Do i need to see a doctor for this? Or is there something i can do at home to correct my structure.

Orthopaedic Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/dupuytren-s-contracture-dc--665714,Dupuytren's Contracture (DC),"I developed DC some years ago and despite one operation to straighten a finger it returned leaving that finger bent by about 45 degrees. I've decided to live with it and seek no further treatment as I felt that the surgery gave only a temporary resolution to the problem and the scar tissue that built up around the operation site made the finger more difficult to move that before the op and despite the contracture. Over the last couple of years the thickening of the tissues in my hand has slowly progressed but is only affecting the tissues connected to the one affected finger and causes me no real issues other than some discomfort in the palm if I'm using a tool that sits in the palm and I push down on it. As I said previously, I'm prepared to live with the discomfort rather than seek more surgery which if anything gives only a temporary solution however, I have a question that some may be able to answer ""when if ever does it stabilise and progress no further and has anyone experienced the condition affecting the tissues in their wrist or causing discomfort in the wrist.

Orthopaedic Disorders,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/quads-hamstrings-constantly-co-activating-extremely-painful-691772,"Quads & hamstrings constantly co-activating, extremely painful","My (otherwise healthy) adult son has undiagnosed chronic pain in his legs. He has seen a neurologist (MRI, xrays, etc) and a rheumatologist (blood panels, needle EMG) --- all normal. My son believes that the pan is caused by misbehaving muscles (constant co-activation), but no one can determine why they're misbehaving and fix the problem. Let me start with the pain: The pain is in the front and back of both thighs, the quads (he points to rectus femoris and sartorius) and hamstrings. It's a dull but strong ache, like a muscle ache, not sharp, not spasms or cramps. It doesn't feel like ""nerve"" pain, rather muscle pain.  It's equal in both legs both in intensity and location, but roughly 60% quads vs 40% hamstrings. There is no tenderness or weakness, and it does not affect his mobility. It is steady and constant; doesn't come in spasms, and is present day and night. On a scale of 0-10, it is 5-7 at any point in time. It was not caused by an injury; it just appeared years ago, progressed and seems to have plateaued.  When it first appeared, he was able to control the pain with OTC meds; now he's been on opioids for several years. There's no pain anywhere else in his body, including pelvis, lower back or lower legs. Pain can be somewhat relieved by stretching or walking around, but pain control is not complete and is temporary Now for what he believes is the culprit: His quads and hamstrings are constantly tensed, whether he's sitting, standing or sleeping. He's unable to relax them, and describes it as doing never ending leg-lifts. All remedies to reduce the tension (i.e., prescription muscle relaxers, massage, walking, stretching) are only partially effective and of course temporary. Side observations: I believe he has anterior pelvic tilt, and he's always had a peculiar gait and stance. He walks noticeably tipped forward, and rather than a smooth stride, he generally takes relatively short, springy steps --- often with a near crouch, and arms slightly out from his body. He also typically stands tipped forward, not erect, knees slightly bent, again as if in a crouch.. So the question is: what's could be causing the quads and hamstrings --- which are antagonistic muscles to boot --- to be constantly co-activating?

I'm Canadian but spent 20 years in Europe working as a chef (apparently worked my fingers to the bone!) I'm now back in rural Canada to be closer to my elderly parents.  In any case,  I was quickly diagnosed with advanced CMC arthritis in the UK and offered surger,  but made the decision to get back to Canada for my parent's sake first, thinking it wouldn't be a problem to sort it out there. Well, do I ever regret not having surgery in the UK! It's been an uphill battle here. The first two doctors I saw mocked my condition - the first told me to ''suck it up - we all have age-related aches and pains'' ,  and that he'd never heard of anyone having  surgery to correct it. The second said she didn't believe this surgery was covered under our health care system and that I'd have to have it privately done in the States at my own cost.  I was about to give up when I saw a third doctor who agreed to refer me to a rheumatologist.  It took eight months to get an appointment and another many months to see an orthopaedic surgeon. Here we are, two years later and I'm finally getting my surgery in two weeks. The harried surgeon talked me into doing both thumbs at once. I know this is completely bonkers, especially as I live alone on a rural acreage and have little support. Why did I agree? Well, I couldn't bear to go through the whole process of waiting again, and I desperately need to get back to work. My career as a chef has been impossible without functioning hands and I've had to take anything else I could find where thumbs weren't terribly required! Ok - so here's my question; has anyone else had both thumbs done at once, and if so, what are your top tips to get through the recovery? I haven't found ANYONE on the whole internet who has had both at once, so this forum is my last resort. Please, no anti-national health care comments please. I am grateful for our system (and the NHS in the UK!!), despite obvious deficiencies. I believe my experience was made worse because I live in a complete backwater. 0 likes, 10 replies "

I was a competitive athlete up until about 10 years ago I contracted the flesh eating disease in the form of Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (long story short) which eventually lead to severe OA. I had a fusion of the subtalar joint about 5 years ago but that sadly didn't solve the pain issue. I am being pushed to go with the fusion as it's ""less risk, more longevity, etc. etc."") I don't have a tremendous amount of range anyways at this point but I understand I would have about 10%+ more with a TAR then a fusion. With my prior fusion I was out for approx. 3 months and healed ""relatively"" well after that with therapy. Risk verses reward, I am a little freaked out to which decision to make and need some feedback. I'm sure there are many others which have faced the same options. On another note, if I was to go the route of TAR, my surgeon didn't discuss options on which replacement so I don't know if I have any control over that.

I decided 3 days ago to find other sufferers and was given the link that brought me here.  It is a big relief to find that I am not the only one, especially after living with this illness for most of my life.  I got infected on a christmas holiday to the village when livin in africa. I was 4 yrs old at the time, and I went for a wade in the stream without slippers on and when we got back to the city like 3 days later I was in agony...felt like something was crawling in my legs but no one could see anything and they even got upset with me thinking I was doing it for attention. Within 5 to 8 days both legs ballooned up, from ankle to my knees, I was rushed to hospital where both legs were incised and according to my mum a small bucket was filled with the puss they squeezed out...that was when my saga with Osteomyelitis started.. I was put on very strong concoction of antibiotics for 6 years straight, kept going for ops each time my legs ballooned up, I had constant fever for months and stayed in the hospital for 4 months or more on blood transfusion as it was making me anaemic..finally the doctors not knowing what else to do opted to amputate my legs but my mom would have none of it and discharged me from hospital, she was a nurse so she had the medical knowledge needed to take care of me at home. Couldnt walk for 2 years, then one day my right leg got better but the infection kept recurring in my left leg throughout my teens..but by my mid teens my bone had started breakin up and coming out whenever the leg was incised..by 23 I had developed osteoarthritis in my right leg (which was my good leg then). We had lost faith in the medical professionals in africa so when I came over to the UK in my late teens we hoped they would know what to do for me, but unfortunately they were more perplexed by my condition than the african doctors and instead pumped me with more antibiotics which i finally became allergic to and had to stop taking after 4-5 years straight on flucloxacillin and fucidin. My GP had been made aware of my condition from the day I registered there, in 1996, but they felt, despite me telling them my history and my mom a nurse telling them, that a test was not necessary and medication would suffice. Years later in 2003 I came across a brilliant, sympathetic locum GP who took my condition seriously *she took the time to LISTEN to how it had been affecting my life* and referred me to a consultant in our local hospital. I never saw him but was seen by one of his team who decided to operate on my left leg in order to perform a debridement. But I was told an hour after the op that too much damage had been done to my bone and consequently in my post op clinic I was informed that as the bone was constantly breaking up there wasnt much they could do other than send me home, then anytime it got inflamed come back for more bone scrapping and filler put in. *What a Joke*  The pain I was living with by that time had become unbearable as every step hurt so much and every nerve in my body tingled with the pain shooting up my legs I broke down and cried..I had night sweats every night that left my mattress soaking it had to be put out to air....I felt so alone, lost and in unimaginable pain and at that moment I was told this I became determined that I was NOT going to let another doctor or medical professional 'shut the door' on me again and I was not going to leave that hospital until someone helped me. I sat on the floor crying and demanding medical assistance. After security came I was put in a room with some nurses whilst the consultant was called out and a discussion amongst the team occured in the hallway, then a member of the team came in to tell me I was being referred to another hospital where there was a specialist.  This was in 2003. The specialist surgeon was not sure of what he would find but decided to take the chance and operated. This was in Jan 2004, 27 at the time. The procedure was a fibulectomy where most of my fibula was taken out of the left leg. A little was left at the ankle and the knee to enable movement/rotation. I was in recovery for 2 years before I could walk with a walking stick to return onto my university course to complete my last year in 2006. As I already had osteoarthritis in my left leg, my amazing locum GP referred me to the same surgeon to have a look at my right leg and in march this year 2008 I had a subtalar fusion of my right ankle. I am still in recovery but everyday gets better. The pain is not as extreme as it was before and I can live with that. I shall always use a walking stick but am ok with that. But what am not ok with is the brick wall *or shoulder shrugging*  I hit whenever I enquired or told medical professionals and even people in general about my condition. Not enough is known about it hence the need for more research. There needs to be more support for people whom have/had this condition and their families. More information needs to be put out there to doctors, NHS trusts, social services departments, GP practices, Walk-in clinics, etc. They need to be made aware of how much this condition can impact on a persons life. What has made my condition even harder to live with is not the purely the condition itself, but the ignorance of people who need to see a limb missing or something physically abnormal or mishaped to believe/accept that there is something actually wrong. I have always had a limp when I walked, but for some reason now I walk with a crutch people seem to believe me more....that should not have to be the case. For anyone out there who has had or is coping living with this condition?  I just wanna say you are not alone, dont give up fighting it. 1 like, 13 replies "
Osteomyelitis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/osteomyelitis-of-the-jaw-in-adulthood-646749,Osteomyelitis of the jaw in adulthood,"My experience has not been anywhere near as horrific as some people's, and the physical impact considerably less, but I have found it interesting how few people in this group have had this disease as an adult. I was diagnosed with   of the jaw just over two and half years ago, at the age of 56. In November 2015 I developed excruciating  , accompanied by a numb section of my chin, and a swollen face. I spent several days and nights trying to get emergency dentist treatment, going to my doctor and getting fobbed off (it was a dental problem, therefore he couldn't/wouldn't treat me, or even prescribe any kind of pain relief!), and finally ending up at A & E. When I finally got an appointment to see my dentist, he was very concerned about the numbness and contacted the local Maxiofacial unit. They said it wasn't urgent and he should either give me root canal work or extract the tooth! My dentist asked which I would prefer and, due to the immense pain, I opted for extraction. The tooth in question was a back molar (second to last tooth, left side, bottom jaw), he gave it the slightest of tugs and it was out - I barely felt it come out - then referred me to the Maxiofacial unit because he still wasn't happy. They finally saw me in January and after a few appointments there, with scans and finally a  , the consultant informed me that I had Osteomyelitis and that some of the marrow in my jaw was dead. Surgery was arranged and I had the dead marrow removed, long with a fair portion of gum - I am now left with a sizeable gap between my last back molar and the next tooth. Eventually the numbness went and the swelling went down - not before my 'day patient' experience became a three-day stay due to my blood pressure crashing through the floor after my op, and no-one being able to get a doctor onto the ward to see me, and extreme difficulty in getting a blood test done (an anaesthetist finally managed to do a blood test after one particular doctor appeared, tried ham-fistedly once, failed, gave up and said he couldn't do it and went off!). My op was around 10 am and a doctor finally saw me around 8 pm and insisted I be sent up to a ward immediately! During my illness, and recovery, I experienced absolutely crashing fatigue - the type that makes you so tired that even the thought of having to get out of bed makes you want to cry. Since then, this tiredness has not one away. I find that I am permanently exhausted, regardless of my diet or amount of exercise I take. Although not as severe as when I had osteomyelitis, it is debilitating and constant. Doctors have just put it down to my lifestyle (I am unemployed), the fact that I am currently overweight, and one even told me 'some people are like that'!! I would be very interested to know if anyone else has, or is, suffering from this kind of fatigue and has had osteomyelitis as an adult. 0 likes, 1 reply "
Osteomyelitis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/jaw-infection-660828,Jaw Infection,"Underwent wisdom tooth extraction. Developed an infection. Was treated with surgical debridement and 4 wks of IV antibiotics (ertapenem). Two weeks into IV and MRI revealed inflammation, no infection, thus no osteo. However, treatment continued for 2 more weeks. Bone biopsy came back and was not necrotic so was not diagnosed with osteo. Just “chronic inflammation”. Has been 2 months since debridement and 1 month since cessation of IV antibiotics. Tongue is still numb on side of surgery. Sensation and slight pain is developing again at suspected sites of previous infection. Cone scan shows bone healing. Is it normal to experience new pain and sensation during “healing” or is this a possible flare? OS says my scan looks good and is likely just healing pains. No new swelling or drainage.

","A recent string of events have led me to investigate how   as an infant might have long-term effects as an adult. I've tried to do a little digging around the see if I could find anything, but I've found nothing so far that explains the effects over a lifetime. As an infant I had osteomyelitis, which was taken care of. The past several years I've been experiencing pain in my upper left thigh while sitting for long periods of time, or even sleeping. I never thought much of it, but a recent talk with my mother made me wonder if it could be in any way related. The area in pain correlates to the place where I had it, and I have not had it looked at since it was taken care of as a child. So, in short, I am just wondering if anyone knows of any lingering effects of the infection after it's been treated, 25 years after the fact. 4 likes, 94 replies "
Osteomyelitis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/osteomyelitis-is-maxillary-area-628014,Osteomyelitis is Maxillary area,"Hello. I was just diagnosed with Osteomyelitis of the upper left maxillary area after suffering for the last few years with facial swelling, intense dizziness, & stabbing pains spreading from my ear to jaw. Needless to say this has been an absolute nightmare & I figured I would share my experience in the hopes that someone can relate & possibly offer their own experiences & advice.  So for years I started suffering from chronic sinus infections & dizziness always on the left side of my head. I learned to live with it for the most part until around a year ago  when it became debilitating. I went to every doctor imaginable thinking it was my thyroid or something. Every blood test came back normal. One morning I woke up & noticed my upper left jaw was throbbing & I started wondering if I had a tooth infection. I remembered that I had a root canal done about 5 years ago on that side & the gum had gotten infected 3 x after it was done. I was always given antibiotics & the gum infection would go away.  I went to the dentist & he didn’t see any infection or anything wrong with the tooth. The throbbing & pain continued to intensify & I went to an oral surgeon who also said the tooth looked fine & that he believed I had a sinus infection & referred me to an ENT. The ENT couldn’t see anything wrong with my sinuses.  I finally decided to have the tooth extracted because even though they said it wasn’t infected by that point I was convinced it was as the pain continued to intensify & it was absolutely coming from right above that tooth.  The dentist who performed the extraction said that a canal was missed & there was significant bone loss around the tooth. She believed that this was the cause of all the pain & dizziness. I was prescribed Clindamycin & went home feeling happy thinking I was finally going to start feeling better....How wrong I was!! That’s when the real problems started. The day after the extraction I felt like I was dying. My face & ear felt like it was going to explode, my heart was pounding over 110 bpm & it felt like someone was stabbing the top of my head with 10 knives & was set on fire.  I went to the ER but because I didn’t have a fever & my gums looked like they were healing they refused to do a CT scan or give me additional antibiotics. They told me I had anxiety.  Over the next few days the pain continued to increase & I went to a local walk-in clinic & begged them for additional antibiotics. They took pity on me & gave me Bactrim & along with the Clindamycin the pain started to subside & I was able to go back to work even though I continued to feel achy & dizzy.  Long story short I had been seen by 3 oral surgeons, 2 ENTs, a neurologist, and every other type of doctor under the sun. None of them wanted to do a CT scan or MRI because they said that it couldn’t be an infection because my gums were healing, my face didn’t have really overt swelling & I was running a high temperature. I spent many many nights crying-half because of the pain & half because of frustration of not being listened to or taken seriously.  I finally went to an infectious disease doctor who immediately ordered an MRI of the area & put me back on antibiotics. Im still waiting for the mri report but I brought her the CD & she said I have a deep spatial face infection & that she’s 99% sure that it spread into the bone based on the appearance of the pics.  I’m supposed to have surgery to drain the abscess & scrape away pieces of the infected bone. She told me I will most likely be on long term antibiotics after.  My question is has anyone else been through this? How bad was the surgery & recovery? Did you feel better after? Was your infection ever cured or does it never really go away? I know that this is really rare & both difficult to diagnose & treat.  *Also side note...I’ve been reading about the dangers of root canals & how it is impossible to get all of the bacteria out of an infected tooth. On top of that once the procedure is done the tooth has no way to receive blood, oxygen, etc. as it has no root & it becomes a breeding ground for bacteria & toxins that your immune system & antibiotics can’t reach. Have any of you had a root canal & did you find that your problems started or worsened in that area of your jaw even years after? I feel like this is the case with me...The crazy thing is the tooth never ever looked infected on an X-ray. I decided to extract it only because I had a gut feeling something was wrong with it because the gum above it got infected a few times since having it done.  I was curious if anyone ever considered a normal seemingly uninfected root canal tooth as a possible “silent” cause? & that while it’s still in the mouth no matter how many surgeries or rounds of antibiotics the infection will always come back since the root canaled tooth is causing it?  That may explain why this condition is so hard to treat. Did anyone have a root canaled tooth extracted & did your condition improve?  Thanks for reading    1 like, 4 replies "
Osteomyelitis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/22-years-old-with-osteomyelitis-in-my-jaw-8-years-of-pain--35227,22 years old With Osteomyelitis in my jaw- 8 years of pain -,"It is quite difficult to start writing about something which has been such a big part of my life for 8 years. I will start from the beginning... It started when I was 14 out of nowhere.  The dentist I saw said I had a displaced jaw bone and this was the reason for my pain. I will always remember him asking if I had a boyfriend 'as kissing would make it worse?!' I did not.  So at this stage I thought that this was the reason for my pain - a displaced jaw bone. I was given 600mg of Iboprufen and took this every day alongside paracetomal (8 tablets a day). Over the next year the pain got particularly worse and my face swelled like a balloon. At the age of 15 I did not sleep at all. I had constant pain and was taking as much painkillers as I possibly could. The swelling got that bad on the right side of my face I felt like a monster. I grew my hair to as long as I could and would constantly cover my face with my long hair and a scarf.  Over the summer it would be increasingly difficult to cover my face without a scarf and when I was 15 I could no longer take this pain from my 'displaced jaw'. My mum and dad took me to A&E. Instantly the doctors here realised something was not right and I was admitted. Many tests were done to see what the problem was. I was discharged from hospital with painkillers and had to wait for my results. I went to see one doctor for my results who I had seen whilst in A&E she specialised in cancer but luckily I was told by her I did not have this. I had tests such as blood tests, bone scans, MRI scans, CT scans and a biopsy which told me that I had Osteomyelitis in my right lower jaw bone. I was referred to a very good consultant in the 'maxfax' department. He said that the steps that would be taken would be firstly an operation which would be done internally to shave away the acess bone and would hopefully relieve me of some pain. Whilst waiting for the operation I was given the antibiotic Amoxycillin. I had the operation when I had just turned 16 I think. By this point I had not had a full night sleep for a year and a half. This was very frustrating as I was trying to live a normal life as possible. I was trying to be a good student at high school and not get behind with work. I was in excrutiatiing pain- I constantly felt like I was being viciously stabbed in the right side of my jaw. This pain often went up into my ear and below my eye. Often I was in too much pain to attend school, luckily I had one amazing teacher there that always sent work home and constantly reassured me that everything would be fine. I was particularly worried as this was happening whilst I was  preparing for my GCSE's. After the operation my face was badly bruised and I had very bad swelling. This was expected though as the operation wasn't plain and simple. One part of my face looked as though I had a tennis ball in it. I also had drains coming from underneath my chin that was draining access blood. I recovered in hospital for around 10 days and was given oral antibiotics to take home.  I saw my consultant regularly. Once the swelling had gone down from the operation- the swelling that was normally there from my osteomylitus wasn't as bad at the side of my jaw as this had been shaved away. Swelling of the bone was still there though. My consultant suggested I have hyperbaric treatment every day for 6 weeks. I was just waiting for a space to become available.  A space came available for the hyperbaric treatment - I remember being at school , I was taken out of my class to be told this treatment was going to start. I cried. A mixture of relief that the pain and this horrible swelling might eventually go. Again I missed a lot of school as I went every day to hull for this treatment. I have sworn to myself I would never have this treatment again. Hyperbaric treatment helps to get oxygen to the jaw so there is a better blood supply to the bone. A lot of cancer patients attended this treatment also. I had to enter a tank every day- put a oxygen mask over my head - something I can only describe as something astronauts would wear! For around two hours I was In this tank with a nurse and around 6 other patients- the pressure in the tank is changed and you have to make your ears pop like you would do on an aeroplane before the pressure goes below a certain number- a weird treatment but I can see the logic in it. I don't think the treatment really worked for me to be honest and I wouldn't do it again- but it may work well for others. For the next couple of years I went on to do my a levels. I was on long term anti biotics as the osteomylitus had not gone away. I found Amoxycillin did not work for me so I was put on long term penicillin whilst on painkillers. I found that stress aggravated my jaw bone and I had episodes where my jaw would swell up more. At this point I had always said to my consultant that it may be my wisdom teeth were making my jaw worse. I was put to sleep and I  had these removed from my right side- my pain did not stop so unfortunately this was not a cause of my osteomyelitis.  After my A levels I decided to take a year out and work full time at the job I was currently working part time at. At this point I was 18-19- during this time as I was older I could take stronger pain killers. I am intolerant to codeine so my options were ibuprofen and paracetomals or dicloflenac when this didn't work I would take tramadol which would have horrible side effects. When these did not control my pain my only option would be to go to A&E and be admitted to have stronger pain killers and anti biotics through an IV.  When I was 19 I was admitted to hospital because I was in so much pain. My consultant wasn't around at the hospital in this occasion so people he worked with decided they would operate as they wanted to drain my swelling at the side of my face of fluid as the swelling was getting uncreasingly worse. I have forgotten to mention that most of the time the opening of my mouth is restricted due to the swelling in and around my bone. This is another reason for operating. When they operated there was not a lot of fluid. The IV antibiotics took my pain and swelling done as well as a lot of morphine! And this episode seemed to be over with. That's what there seems to be these episodes where my face swells and which then leads to a lot of pain. Some times I go months without these flare ups. From the age 19.5 - 21 I had minor flare ups which were bare able.  At 19 I started the studying for my 3 year course for my degree- I didn't want this horrible infection to take over my life. During this time I was given a mouth guard to wear at night to make sure that grinding my teeth is not an aggravating factor, and I also had root canal treatment to make sure I had nerves in my teeth and that a tooth was not dead and the cause of the osteomylitus. All of my teeth are fine. It is now December 2011 I am 22. I am in the 3rd and final of my university degree. This year I have had many episodes/flare ups of my osteomyelitis - even though I always have it- my face can flare up and swell more and the pain is worse and becomes unbearable. This year I have been admitted into hospital twice.  First in April- the reason for this flare up I believe to be because of stress  with work from university as I had 4 exams in a week so lots of intense  studying. I had IV of antibiotics and Painkillers in hospital which seemed to work. I was in hospital for 4 days. August of this year I was admitted for the second time. This was a very different experience for me and not a pleasant one. My consultant was not informed that I was admitted and I had doctors which new nothing about my Illness working on me. I was in for 8 days. I was not happy and did not feel any better from me entering hospital until the time I left. Normally when I am given metrodisonal and clindamycin through IV this reduces the swelling this did not happen and the swelling started to go to the side of my throat. After seeing my consultant he suggested that we operate again as the anti biotics are not working as effectively. I really want to finish my degree at uni so I am trying to simply power through the pain. My consultant is fantastic and we work together as he rightly says nobody knows my condition as much as me. So I am delaying another operation at the minute. The operation Wil not guarantee that the osteomyelitis will go completely and this time he would have to operate externally which will leave me with a big scar. This is the reason for him not wanting to operate before with me being young he does not want to leave me with a big scar.  At the minute I am in the middle of another flare up it is close to Christmas  and I do not want to be in hospital again So I am trying to control the pain at home.  A few things I have forgot to mention: at one point my consultant explained to my mum the pain I was going through like having 10 abcesses under each tooth on the side of my face ( hopefully this will put the pain I go through in context)  Also factors I have found which make my osteomylitus flare ups worse: Cold weather (the reason for my recent flare up) The change in weather Lack of sleep Cold drinks Alcohol assumption when I am having a flare up. Finally, sorry if my story is a bit all over the place it is hard to remember everything that has happened in 8 years. Please anyone get in touch who have this condition maybe we can help each other?! 8 likes, 252 replies "
Osteomyelitis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/swelling-bone-pain-lower-jaw-671417,Swelling/bone pain/lower jaw,"Last year I had a sinus procedure through my mouth- (biggest mistake!). I developed swelling lower jaw area. Ent states it not infected not sure how I got that swelling as he would expect swelling above lip area not lower jaw - weird something happened. Had a lot of pain inside mouth after from a canker sore and ent thought since I had a cold sore at some point after procedure that maybe it settled on a nerve inside mouth- canker sore was along cheek flesh. So I went to different specialists all types for this swelling. It’s not infected over and over I am told. It’s sensitive to the touch that area of flesh and I get bone pain at times underneath the swell like along the last 3 bottom teeth. Where wisdom tooth was and 2 teeth infront of it. And one area in particular it is tender when I touch that part.   Amox/clov did not help, levaquin no help, doxy no help, I was on a short dose of clindamycin and feel it did help don’t recall it help with swelling I thought by day 5 of med that when I touched swell it wasn’t as sensitive but hard to say. Cold weather aggravats that area of flesh. I remember walking on a cold day and it was just pain in the flesh area. Had MRI/CT scan all clear yet I completely know if it was a bone infection you have to have a certain amount of bone loss to show up on it. Dealing with issues with my upper maxillary sinus area- bone pain up there- ent and dentist back forth nightmare $$$ and teeth extracted and pain still there if not worse. Sinus feels puffier since last extraction so yeah me with trying to figure sinus upper jaw crap. So nuclear   I guess is next but I just had 2 teeth extracted and not sure how long to wait until it doesn’t light up since I heard after a procedure it will light up. Heard of gallium scan as well. Live near John Hopkins and have been tempted to go to hospital there. Not sure if they would just blow me off and wonder if some freaking dr would say gee that swelling isn’t normal we need to investigate! But no I just get shrugged shoulders and told don’t know! Told since mri came back fine I need to accept it’s nothing. I once went to my local hospital back in January and in triage I explained my pain she just it’s not an emergency and didn’t put me back through and that I had an mri and that since it came back fine here is a prescription for naproxen and have a nice day! Getting another mri this Friday. My primary dr turned down my nuclear test going way back to Jan. So he ordered mri instead. So meds on now no effect.  Anyone from around VA/DC /Maryland area that recommends a dr that could help? Should I go to John Hopkins if mri comes back fine?  I had dental conebeam CT’s and the last oral surgeon said he didn’t see anything on the ct scan. I just had another cone beam today and I asked about it because he didn’t take time to really look at scan he was focused on issues I was having in upper jaw. Not sure if there is someone out there that can really look at these scans and really take time in doing so- oral surgeon stated osteomyelitis is a late diagnosis so obviously it’s never taken seriously so this is why people get screwed.  Thank you... 0 likes, 2 replies "

I am now 19 years old and am living with horrible pain in the knee that had the osteomyelitis, I've recently had x-rays and MRI's done that show no signs that the infection is back but they also don't show any reason in why I am in as much pain as I am.  My orthopedic doctor is at a loss as to what to do to help me with my pain, I was put on   medicine that didn't help at all. My doctor wants to try cortisone shots and physical therapy, and at this point I'm at a loss at what to do. When I got osteomyelitis my doctor made it seem like it was going to be a done deal once the infection was gone but sadly that just isn't the case. I currently have a mobility assistance dog that helps me with being able to walk and other tasks that have been limited due to the pain and how it is starting to affect my other knee, hips and back.

Osteoporosis and Osteopenia,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/-severe-osteoporosis-diagnosis-now-significant-improvement--669388,"""Severe Osteoporosis"" diagnosis.  Now significant improvement. ","Four and a  half years ago I got this diagnosis (age 62) out of the blue. I had no symptoms, no fractures, and the GP had suggested a Dexa scan. All of a sudden I changed from a person who was really active, (even used to rollerblade!) to one who felt fearful and delicate.  I read about people who fractured turning over in bed, sneezed, or were the recipient of a 'bear hug'. Awful stuff.  I sought out a good Rheumatologist and found one who had trained in Harvard and practiced quite close. After ordering a batch of tests, I attended for a review. She said that no specific cause was found but perhaps my acknowledged pretty 'woeful diet"" in the past   (I'm vegetarian and my protein intake was really poor) was relevant. She straight away prescribed Forteo and said there was no other medication that would come close to being as effective as this as my spinal T-score of -4.5 placed me at a very high risk of fracturing. So I consented.  Two years later I finished Forteo and was then prescribed Actonel "" to consolidate any gains  I had made""  and to continue the protection of an anti-fracture medication   I had no troublesome side- effects from either medication. Last week (four and a half years later, I had a further Dexa scan. My T-score had reduced to  -3.7 and I have had no fractures. This represents a significant 17.7% improvement in my bone density. A few weeks ago while clipping the hedge, I stupidly over- reached and toppled off a 5-step ladder on to the grass. Thankfully I was unhurt, nothing broke. . . . Briefly, what ELSE was I doing to help myself? *** Exercise - I'm not great on exercise, though I'm pretty active. I walk the dog each day for max. 30 mins. with a lot of stopping and starting for pee breaks! Once a week I attend an Osteo Pilates class with an OP physio and then for 10 mins. each day I practice 3 or 4 of these exercises at home.  *** Diet  - A lot better than in the past, plenty of cheese, milk and yoghurt. Not a lot of 'greens' as I have IBS and they can set it off.  *** Medication - Was on a reducing dose of  Prednisone for another condition, now stopped. Forteo, now stopped, and Actonel continues. Vitamin D, and calcium supplements if needed.  *** Supplements - Multivitamin only. The Rheumatologist last week was really pleased with such an improvement and advised me to continue with the Actonel for another 3 years when I have another scan and full review. My message to others -  My conclusion from all this: MEDICATION WORKS!  I truly believe that my own paltry efforts and my Pilates sessions contributed maybe 5% of this improvement, no more.  I completed the FRAX risk of fracture tool and keyed in my scores before starting medication and then the most recent result: After diagnosis, my risk of 'major osteoporotic fracture' in the next 10 years was 54%( with a T-score of -4.5). Last week, my 'risk of major fracture' in the next 10 years was 22% (with a T-score of -3.7). I am well aware that my bones are still in poor shape but I'm confident that I'm doing the very best for my condition and managing pretty well.  Juno     3 likes, 60 replies "

Osteoporosis and Osteopenia,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-need-some-encouraging-words-681543,I need some encouraging words ,"I've had some really bad health issue happen to me this year.  In February I fell as I was getting out of my car and ended up breaking my left ankle in 3 places, spraining my right ankle, fracturing a rib and injuring my back even more then it already was. So it took me 3 months to heal from all of that. While I was healing from the fractures I was diagnosed with gastritis, iron deficiency anemia, diabetes and bronchiectasis. then two months ago I bent over to get something out of the bottom drawer of the refrigerator and I felt my back spasm. I was then diagnosed with a fractured vertebrae. in the past 2 months I have increased the number of fractured vertebrae and now I have a total of 5. I saw a spine surgeon and he did kyphoplasty on the two lowest fractured vertebrae. unfortunately when he injected the cement into the fracture some of the material went into my artery and traveled through my heart and into my lungs. now I have a pulmonary embolism made of cement. actually I have a number of them in both lungs and they will be there for the rest of my life. that's because when the cement goes in its liquid and it then hardens. So I think what happened was it was in liquid form when it traveled through my artery and became solid once it reached my lungs. Because of all the fractures, the muscles in my back are spasming. I can't survive anymore of this. the pain I am in right now is so horrible I can't even describe it. In fact the only reason I can write this is because I am between spasms. They come on whenever I move wrong. I have a pain management doctor and she's giving me a tiny bit more pain med then I was already taking for my chronic back pain. some of you might know me from the PMR group. I have had PMR for 2 years and I have been on Prednisone for those 2 years. I'm sure that the prednisone created the initial problem of thinning my bones out even though I've been on calcium/vit.

The chelation treatments were very successful.  Read this article on lead and D. After my lead levels were more normal, I also started receiving HRT therapy using Pellets.  I can now report that I am on the mend.  My bone density scans (DEXASCANS) have continuously improved.  I feel great. RUN, don't walk as fast as you can to find a GREAT NMD who can help you with natural solutions to heal your aging bones. Fosamax, Bonina, Forteo, Prolia, Reclast type drugs are all poisons. They all increase the production of the WRONG kind of bone cells.  Plus the side effects are dreadful.  Several of my friends have developed osteonecrosis of the jaw because they would not listen to me since I am not a doctor.  I understand their reluctance to look into something different.  However, many of these meds are NOT good for us.  We are treated like a bunch of lab rats in many cases.  Our health and quality of like really suffer.

According to established treatment protocols, I was put on high dose prednisone treatment (mean dose 80 mg) for about 4 months and an immunosuppressant adjuvant drug (Myfortic). During this time  -My condition slowly improved -I developed severe osteoporosis over just 4 months ( ) accompanied by a total of 12 vertebral fractures that cost me 4 inches of height and led to agonizing pains Initially I only complained of mild back pain, which the dermatologists responsible for my treatment promptly ignored. Eventually I visited a rheumatologist who suggested a bone mass density scan and x ray ( by this point I could barely walk from the crippling pains) that revealed the sad truth : -4.0 spine (femur was fine)  and 12 fractures. I was immediately put on teriparatide treatment (Forsteo) and when the fractures healed (about 3 months after starting forsteo) began physio. All this in 2017. It is now more than a year later, my prednisone is down to 5mg for the past 7 months and despite my intensive therapy and restoration work outs (which I still do for more than 3 hours per week) , my spine score has dropped further to [b]-4.5 [b] . Thankfully I have suffered no more fractures, I am not in pain and due to the restoration of my core muscles, I have regained 2 inches in height (the rest is gone forever due to the deformation of the vertebrae) … Honestly, the future seems pretty bleak, rheumy says I have some sort of genetic predisposition to glucocorticoid osteoporosis and as long as I take even 1 mg of prednisone my bones will continue to worsen. At the same time I cannot stop the prednisone or lower it further because pemphigus is right around the corner.

It started one night, at around 6 am, i woke up with pain in my upper abdomen/lower chest and back. It felt like i was being stepped on by an elephant, or tied up with rubber bands all around me, squeezing me. The pain was unreal and i couldnt go back to sleep, i was crying and frustrated. My mom gave me a strong pain pill that was able to soothe the pain and put me back asleep. It happened again a month later, all down to waking up at 6 am. Took a pain pill and went back to sleep. Then it happened 2 months later, 6 am wake up, pain and everything. Then it didnt happen until around fall 2018. once again, 6 am, tight pain. It didnt happen again untip about a month ago (feb 2019) and tonight. I seriously dont know whats going on, why i wake up at 6 am, why the pain is so unbelieveable or anything. I know id probably have to get tests done or whatever, but i dont have insurance and havent for about 1.5 years, and i doubt a free clinic would do much.

Basically, I want to know if I can still grow taller. I myself would call my diet healthy, as I eat a large vegetable salad every single day and drink mostly water. From reading online I found out that apparently lack of proper nutrition or working out during poverty can cause someone to not grow as tall as they could. I worked out with my own body weight at the age of 14. I seriously would be happier in my own skin and could accept myself better if I would be a few inches taller - even if it would just be 2.

Forward to recent months, the dizziness has been accompanied with headaches, small (and very infrequent) nosebleeds, and extreme fatigue. I decided to play this off as my usual dizziness, and tiredness from work. However, the fatigue and lightheadedness started to affect my relationship, work, and many other aspects of my life as I could not stay awake without napping at least once throughout the day, and falling asleep at roughly 9-10pm, despite waking up at roughly 9-10am that morning. I used to have an extremely high redolence for sleep, which is why this is now wrong feeling to me. I had made a doctors appointment on the 4th of this month, to which I discovered I only had 15 minutes to try and explain everything; discovering I couldn't I decided to focus on only the major issues, however I felt this made me have to skip a lot of details. A FBC was ordered, a thyroid function test, Vitamin-D test, Kidneys, and liver. All of the results came back as normal aside from my Vitamin D level which was 22.1. I was prescribed Colecalciferol 20,000unit capsules, twice a week, for 3 months. Since my meeting with the doctor, my symptoms have severely worsened, and new ones appearing. At the time of meeting the doctor, my appetite was normal, though now I have little to no appetite, due to the constant nausea that I am experiencing daily, and my weight has dropped approx. 3kg in little over a week, which is very unusual for my body as I always found it difficult to loose weight (however I am not overweight) This new symptom has been accompanied by the usual fatigue, dizziness, and now lower back aches and extremely bad  , I get short of breath while walking (though I am a smoker, roughly 6-10 cigarettes a day), and have to sit down after only moments of walking. My concentration also appears to be slightly off, as I find myself thinking hard about simple things that I once found easy. Lastly I am now having daily  , and what I could describe ""hot flushes"" throughout the day, and slightly feverish (though I cannot check my temperature as I do not have the tools.) I believe I have remembered all of the symptoms, though my head is not very clear. I am happy to answer any queries. Thank you. 0 likes, 15 replies "

I'll try my best to describe the feelings: I have no other issues besides these weird sensations that is giving me anxiety because it affects my overall quality of life. I have no history of anxiety disorder and I'm not going through a stressful period in my life. I've done blood tests, nerve tests, ECG, CT, Echogram and everything came back normal. Diabetes, MS, Fibro, Hypothyroidism, neuro disorders are all ruled out. No circulation or heart issues. No deficiencies of vitamin B12, vitamin D, magnesium, potassium or iron. For further investigation, MRI of the brain, cervical spine and lumbar spine is requested. Brain MRI: Normal with no issues. Lumbar MRI: Mild intervertebral disc prolapsed of L4/L5 but no obvious loss of high signal of the disc on T2WI. Cervical MRI: Mild disc prolapsed of C3/C4, C4/C5, C5/C6 and C6/C7 resulting in minimal anterior theca sac indentation. Loss of cervical lordosis (flat neck) due to muscle spasms.

I was given Neurobion and Lyrica for 2 weeks but it did not help. I really don't know what to do next to treat my symptoms. Could it be some minor nerve entrapment somewhere in the neck though I don't have dizziness or vertigo? Could it be TMJ though I have no jaw pain and swallowing difficulty?

Monday - plot 70 finish fix Tuesday - plot 77 fix Wednesday - 69 final This story is one that spans nearly 10 years of my life now & im still no further to a conclusion than I was 10 years ago. It all started when I was around 17 when I developed symptoms of heart  , shortness of breath & a heavy, full feeling in my chest. The worse being originally a sensation of suffocation & not being able to feel as if my need for air was satisfied, even when resting & no physical exertion. All this was accompanied by regular feelings of a hard heartbeat in my chest & many chest flutters. Needless to say as a 17 year old boy this absolutely terrified me & I went on to spend the next 2 years in an absolute state. I would not leave the house, attending the doctors surgery multiple times a week, I was 100% convinced that something was badly wrong with my body. This had a very adverse effect on my mental health also, I retreated inside myself and became a bit of a recluse. This didn’t help my case with the doctors I would visit. I would be told again & again & again that my problem was  , to which i was 100% sure it wasn’t. Eventually after many visits to the GP they finally began some investigations - I had all sorts, ECG’s, 24 hour ECG’s many physical examinations, and finally an  . Which everything was 100% fine with. After this it was decided that no further action would be taken & I would be left with the explanation that what I was experiencing were symptoms of anxiety. So as hard as it was to accept, I went on in life & went from being jobless, at home all the time & decided to move to my fathers house & learn a trade in carpentry. Now nearly 7 years later, I have my own family, my own house & a good job. Rarely experience anxiety, although I have periods where I do get very anxious, but these are very intermittent over periods of months. BUT - the symptoms still remain this far on. This is something which baffles me as I am still sure something isn’t right with my body, except I can usually exercise relatively well & have a physical job where I’m exerting myself fairly regularly & have mostly no problems. There seems to be no trigger for my symptoms, except perhaps after I eat a big meal. Other than that they come & go as they please, now the worst one being a sensation of a heavy heartbeat, and an awfully uncomfortable feeling of fullness & heaviness in my chest. I don’t know where to go from here, I don’t feel like GPs take me seriously anymore, and I’m suffering on a daily basis, it makes my life 10x harder on a daily basis. I don’t know if anyone has any comments or advice for me, anything would be appreciated. Sorry for the long post & thanks for reading. Joe 0 likes, 3 replies "

I have been to the GP who firstly prescribed antibiotics (Amoxiccilin) and now he has referred me for a second endoscopy. Furthermore, I have struggled with anxiety on and off over the years and do get panic attacks which makes me feel weak and it feels like there is a knot in my throat.

Oesophageal Cancer,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/advice-for-esophagectomy-recovery--634332,Advice for esophagectomy recovery???,"Hello. I'm 10 days away from an esophagectomy. I'm wondering if any of you who have been through this before have advice that might be useful during the recovery stage. I used the ""ankle problems"" area of these boards last year and received many extremely helpful tips there for the issue that I was having then. As a bit of background, you can tell from my spelling that I'm in the US. I've had Barrett's esophagus for approximately 30 years, and what the doctors all believe to be Stage 1 cancer (adenocoarcinoma) was found during a routine endoscopy last month. I know that what is believed to be Stage 1 can be found to be Stage 2 during surgery, so I'm prepared for that. Assuming that Stage 1 is confirmed, I won't be undergoing chemo or radiation. I've had an endoscopy, high contrast CT scan, PET scan and endoscopic ultrasound so far. I don't smoke or drink and I never have. I'm in good health, except for the whole cancer thing. :-) My doctor does robotically-assisted, minimally-invasive surgery, but he keeps a thorasic surgeon in the room in case the chest has to be opened unexpectedly. My expected hospital stay is 8 - 10 days. Did any of you use a wedge pillow? Did it help? About how long did you have to eat only very soft foods? Can you eat ""regular"" food now? How bad is the reflux? How long before you could drive? Anything you wish that you'd known before the surgery? Were any of you diagnosed at Stage 1 and had the cancer return? I'd really appreciate any information that you would be willing to share. I don't personally know anyone who has had this surgery. 0 likes, 8 replies "

Then I took a fourth of 5 mg pill for about a week. Again the chest pain slowly was going away. I told my doctor about how I now knew I never had a manic attack and the mental doctor told me to since down so low on pills just don't take them if they are hurting you. Then I got in touch with my medical doctor and he told me to get off of all of my meds. It was very bad head pain for along time.

Esophageal cancer?!😞,"To start off I am 16 years old yes I know I am young but I can’t get fact of me having esophageal cancer off my head. But let me start off when it first started which was mid November of 2017. I started having major anxiety attacks, I would get dizzy, difficult breathing and stuff like that. So I was taken to hospital and I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder. I also went 2nd time because I thought I had acid reflux because I would have syptomps like ALOTT of burping even when I have not eaten I would burp and then less than ONE second I would get another one and it would disturb me a lot and this has been for probably 3 years I have this but I would always mucous in back of my throat; it’s always there I don’t know why but I thought it could have been reflux since I would get the mucous even more when I would drink for example Gatorade or even brush my teeth(Cologate tooth paste). So they they gave some omprezale which did absolutely nothing and I went on different type of omprezale which was in little pills which I found actually did help with the burping. But the mucous part I found that it could be cattarh which I am taking nasal spray for and is working out for now. But moving further around February the anxiety attacks were terrible. I didn’t even wanna go to school I would cry to stay home and this lasted for 2 weeks and I would talk to teachers all day because I could not stay calm at all and they knew about this so yea. But after these 2 weeks I became fine and wasn’t scared to go to school or anywhere else. But what also started November was I started getting scared to eat food. Idk why or how it started but I think it was because I use to get difficulty eating when I would have panic attacks which was during dinner sometimes but other times I ate perfectly fine with no trouble but near the end of February till now I can not swallow at all, I am to scared to swallow the only things I can eat is cereal and oatmeal that’s it. I did lose about 9 pounds because of me not eating but when I went to get checked out again for weight I increased 5 more pounds which I guess is good. So now basically I have gotten stuck with the idea of having cancer in esophagus because I did have reflux for while and it is difficult for me to swallow which makes me get anxiety and I’m so scared now. I have met with nutrition team in hospital to help me eat and they also said if I want I can have a barium swallow test be done which would allow me to see how stuff goes down my throat and into esophagus which I thought it would be perfect because it  can also check for other things like cancer but I still don’t get the appointment for that and I’m still not eating proply. I’m dehydrated and lacking of nutrients.. I’m really scared it could esophageal cancer causing difficult eating.

Since last November he's been complaining about it being difficult swallowing food and since July this year it got worse to the point where he was drinking 2-3 glasses of water with his food to be able to swallow the food. After going to his dr a few times, he yesterday went for an endoscopy. The endoscopist said everything looked normal apart from some inflammation of the oesophagus about 30cm in (his notes on the patient copy of the report says 'At approximately 30cm into the osephagus I noted resistance. The area was narrower and inflammed. Unable to traverse as patient found it uncomfortable. Biopsies taken and procedure terminated' . He said the inflammation was most likely from stomach acid coming back up and prescribed my son omeprazole for 8 weeks and then for him to have the endoscopy repeated. The endoscopist doctor has rung today to say that he showed my sons results to another specialist in endoscopy at the hospital who has suggested a CT scan which my son has to go for. Is this just the hospital being thorough with the CT scan as the endoscopy was terminated at 30cm or is the CT scan because they may feel that the inflammation may be due to malignancy?

Since then I've been piecing my life back together and am currently doing really well and pursuing my PhD in medicine and artificial intelligence. Anyway the first year after my psychosis I avoided meds cause of a lack of insight then in September of 2017 I finally decided that it might be a good idea to get some treatment and started taking 10mg of zyprexa I took this dose for a while then went down to 5 mg then after a couple months on that I went down to 2.5 then 1.25 and after a total of 8 months I quit.  I've been off zyprexa now for a week and the withdrawal has been worse than heroin and benzos combined. Not the physical but the anxiety which effects my thoughts luckily it seems that the withdrawals only last a week for me so right now I'm mostly ok.   However, and here's the reason for my post I've put on a lot of weight not a crazy amount but I used to be jacked with a 6 pack and now I've got a dad bod this makes me feel like s**t.

I stopped this medication cold turkey after being on 5mg last december. Did not have any idea around what the withdrawls would be like. Was doing okay eating healthy exercising regualrly sleeping well then panicked after going through withdrawl syndrome upon discontinuation 4 months after i had stopped and was reinstated on 2.5mg after i experienced a relapse though i know this was part of the withdrawl. I am now considering stopping once again but gradually. Its taken away my personality and sense of self and i am wandering around like a zombie. Its done nothing but damage me as a person and i am only 24 years old. I have now been back on olanzapine for 4 weeks on the smallest dose just to help deal with my supposed psychotic symptoms. I experienced extreme paranoia and an inability to function or be myself when i stopped cold turkey as the withdrawls eventually caught up with me. I currently experience extreme tiredness constant   and mental block. I wake up feeling disorientated and all over the place. I can't seem to articulate as to why i was put on the stuff in the first place. I did have a one off psychotic episode back in 2014 when i experienced hallucinations and voices. Though since then my brain pretty much healed on its own without any medication. Even my ex girlfriend told me i seemed pretty normal it was only until 2017 that i was put onto olanzapine. What a huge mistake this was! I remember before i went on this i felt more or less okay! Its affected my memory in quite a big way and i cant remember simple things or what i even did the day before like what i talk about to others. I am terrified now that i will remain on this med for quite some time. This is the worst thing ever to withdraw from. I am furious at the medical professionals for putting me on this poison in the first place. I need some guidance right now more than ever on how to withdraw properly and how long this will take? Will i ever get back to normality again? Olanzapine is a brain killer and i certainly do not feel like i should have been on this in the first place! The tremors i got, brain zaps, insomnia, racing thoughts from cold turkey was unbearable! Will i ever be normal again?   please any advice would be greatly appreciated! Sorry this isn't so clear i am just scared. Thank you and god bless everyone. 0 likes, 19 replies "

This drug is the strongest appetite stimulant on earth, even surpassing Cannabis.  Make no mistake, you will gain weight, more so than with any other drug on earth, you will have an unbelievable hunger and inability to feel full, your   sensitivty will be affected negatively and you will greatly increase your risk of Diabetes type II, none of which your physician is likely to inform you about.    When I read that patients who already have Diabetes or are overweight are put on this drug, it is honestly sickening. Even if you actually do have a psychotic or other disorder requiring an antipsychotic, there are MANY better and safer alternatives atypical antipsychotics from which your doctor can choose from.  Seroquel, Saphris, Geodon, Risperdal, etc etc.  There is really  condition or justifiable reason that this drug should ever be used  7 likes, 40 replies "

I was prescribed zyprexa for insomnia for one year and a half.  I was having trouble sleeping one night per week and had been prescribed 0.5mg of klonopin which was no longer effective.  My psychiatrist assured me this would help! I was very reluctant to take this pill (2.5 mg), but my Harvard trained psychiatrist said it was my anxiety talking. I started taking this pill and it worked great for about a month or two. I was told to increase my dose to 5mg without any risk of dependence. Within several months I had gained 35lbs (I am actually very slender and have difficulty gaining weight) and my blood sugar had risen significantly, plus the insomnia was back one night per week. I was then told to increase my dose to 7.5mg.  I did as instructed for a short while and went to a sleep specialist.  He told me this drug was very dangerous to prescribe to someone with just insomnia and GAD.  He recommended I find an alternative after my sleep study proved that I had insomnia that was not attributable to sleep apnea. I went back to my psychiatrist and told him I wanted to wean off the zyprexa and try something new. He told me I had no need to wean/taper as there were no side effects associated with this drug and to switch to 25mg of Seroquel. I again foolishly did as instructed and have been experiencing withdrawals from hell for the past 4 months (tremors, anxiety through the roof, restlessness,  , severe headaches, horrible stomach issues and spasms in my stomach that a gastro is currently treating), but the worst by far is the severe, chronic insomnia. I thought not sleeping once per week was bad. I now get 0 to 2 hours of sleep per night since stopping the zyprexa. I never sleep any more than that even w klonopin, seroquel, and I am now trying 30mg of restoril with no success (after stopping seroquel and lowering my klonopin dosage). Going through all this while still having to work at a stressful job, paying a mortgage on my own, driving myself to and from places (as I have no alternate means of transportation) etc. I feel so hopeless at this point. I am desperate for help. Has anyone had any success in treating such severe insomnia after stopping zyprexa? I'm trying to stay positive, so success stories only!  I have tried everything from CBT-I, therapy, supplements, meditation, etc. with no help or relief. Going back on zyprexa is NOT an option. Eli Lilly and my psychiatrist are both criminals!

So then on they made me have an endoscopy like 2 weeks later and they looked in esophagus and stomach and showed everything was absolutely fine inside which surprised me and the doctor said the pill seemed to have gotten stuck because you were very nervous and your anxiety was off the roof which it was during the barium swallow test. But anyways yea so they said I could eat anything I want but I still have my anxiety off eating, I am still scared to eat and I fear it could muscle problems in esophagus or something like that.

His weight fluctiuated from 215 lbs to 240 lbs in his last three years of high school. By the time he graduated from HS he was 6'4 220. In the first year of University life he got up to 244lbs. No activity, just eating and eating...hahahaha... Around 10 months ago we started noticing something that was new in him. When he would eat, he would make this strange sound. He said it was hic-ups, but he did it with an exagereated sound. But everything was nomal. He could eat like before no problems at all with anything. Only thing was that weird sound he'd make. (hic-ups) This went off and on for a while. About five months ago he started saying he felt preasure in his chest when he ate. He felt like he had too much acid in his stomach and felt the food come up. Obviously we thought heartburn and told him to take anti-acids. That never worked. Finally in April 7th we had a doctors appointment to see what this was. Up to now he felt the preasure, but he still felt good. He was active, went out and play football, baseball etc. he went as far as telling the doctor that if not for this weird strange feeling in his chest and throat he felt like he could run a marathon. He was given mediscations for aci reflux,  those didn't  work. We knew then it was not acid reflux. From there we were sent to a ENT specialist. Ear Nose and Throat Doctor. He didn't find anything wrong that he could see. That specialist ordered a swallow study. When he went for that study it came back normal. My Son told us that day he felt fine.....he felt like the thing he swallowed pass through nornmally, something that was not the case every other time. He discribed it as bubbles in his throat with preasure on his chest. From there we went to a GNT. He had a endescopy done in early June. That revealed nothing. Everything was normal. A byopsy was done on his esophagus during that endescopy and it too came back normal. During this time form April to June we see him having a lot more difficulty eating. On the visit to the doctor on April he weighed 244 lbs. When we saw the Gastorenterplogyst he was down to 230 lbs. The G doctor was miffed by these syptoms and went as far to tell us there was nothing else he could do. He said he had never seen a case like this. By this time my wife and myself were on the internet looking for answers and we found a test called upper GI test. The famous Barium swallow test. We suggested to his G doctor to order this test. He did and we saw the problem. When they saw the issue they couldn't believe he was getting anything down. The liquid he got was just stuck at the bottom of his esophagus. From there he got another study done. This one was a Manometry study, were they measure the preassure on the esaphagus. His results were not good. He had stage 2 achalasia. From the first day he visited our primary doctor on April 7th to July 30th my son weighed 212 lbs. Once we had all the information he decided to go into surgery. Dr. Mark Takata from Scripps Health in San Diego, California did the procedure. By now we knew all the options for him, but the decision was my sons. In the last three weeks befor surgery he couldn't even drink water. He would have to vomit to feel relief. He had his good days and bad days. in the last three weeks before surgery it seemed like he had nothing but bad days. Every time he vomited it was self induced. He had to make himself vomit to get relief. Not eeven water would go to his stomach , it was that bad. By the grace of God something did pass down to his stomach because he was still having bowel movements. Not as fgrequent as before obviously, but he still had to go to the bathroom. He joked every time he would go to the batroom he'd would ckeck off a sign at the door he was planning on placing....Puke, Piss, Poop......hahahahaha....that's because everytime he got up when we were eating we asked......are you going to puke ??? And we were all tired and stressed about this. July 30th,2014 was the day he had a Myatomy done. The procedure took about 2 hours. He had a Heller Myotimy with a Dor Fundoplacation. You all know what this is im sure. Today is the 7th day after surgery. He is doing very well. When he came out of surgery his face was puffy due to the air used to inflate the stomach. within 7 hour of the surgery that swelling started to go down. By the next day he still had puffyness under his eyes, but by the day we went home that swelling was gone. His procedure was done on Wednesday July 30th and we were dismissed from the hospital on Friday August 1st. The pain he has was normal pain associated with the procedure. He had five incissions in his abdomen. and those are the ones that hurt. He started eating liquids and THEY ALL WENT DOWN right after surgery. He said he felt the water go down to his stomach for the first time in many months. He didn't feel that water, food stuck feeling in his chest anymore. On Friday morning 2 days after surgery he had a very severe pain in his chest. This was due to gas. He couldn't pass gas. This was atributated to the narcodics he was given for pain. He did pass gas a few times on Thursday, but very minimal. That particular pain happened three times After surgery.Friday morning, Friday night at home and Saturday evening . He had the same barium swallow study done on Friday at the hospital to see if the surgety was working fine. It was. The sawllow he had went right through. He's been eating very soft foods. noodles, sopus, pastas (very moist) ice cream, chicken (also very moist chicken ) not fried, but little pieces of chicken in the noodles. Also rice he;s had. He has gone to the bathroom normally with no problems. Not that he had digestive pronblems before, but bathroom trips are as normal as you might want after surgery. We know all the risks and what might follow after this surgery, but it was really the only option he had due to his symptoms.. As soon as he came out of surgery he could drink and it would go right through without any problems. Dr. Takata who performed the operarion told us he normally shaves off 7 cm of the muscle fibers in the esophagus, but this time he did 9 cm. not quite sure what the reason for this was, but he did explain to us why. I just don't remember. If any of you has any questions that I might be able to help with plrase feel free to ask me. This disorder is a bad one. it's incredibly stressing for everyone involved. As a Father it eats at you to see your kids go through this and not be able to protect them and help them. The one thing I can tell everyone is that while this disorder is very bad, it's not going to kill you. The're options to fight this thing just have to keep faith and not give up. I will keep posting here to update my sons condition. I pray and hope he continues on this path and regains some sort of normalcy. OnlyGod knows what awaits us. Our job is to do everything possible to get better. Good luck to all, and remember you're not alone. Your family is with you and that makes a huge difference. God Bless.   13 likes, 150 replies "

Oesophageal Achalasia and Spasm,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/recurrence-of-achalasia-after-heller-myotomy-29694,Recurrence of Achalasia after Heller Myotomy,"Hi I'm now 38 and was diagnosed with achalasia in 1998. The condition stated in late 1997 and progressed very quickly. I was unable to eat any form of solid food and every meal had to be accompanied by buckets of water! I had the myotomy and a fundoplication in Sept 1999. However, the symptoms soon returned. They never got as bad as they were before the operation, but I think suffers of the condition become very adept at managing the condition. I went through a series of dilations and other tests until, in 2005, my surgeon decided that another operation was the only hope. However, by this time, I had completely lost confidence in my surgeon and decided to live with the condition. I have found that swallowing has continued to get worse over the years, but I manage it reasonably well by drinking lots of water with meals and avoiding problematic foods such as bread, pasta and fruit. However, I suffer from dreadful substernal pain and have been admitted twice to A&E with a suspected heart attack. My use of painkillers is now at pretty serious levels so I am having the condition investigated again. I guess that I knew this was inevitable, but I'm not looking forward to the barium swallows, endoscopy, manometry etc and I guess further surgery is unavoidable. I utterly sympathise with those who have the condition. It is painful, restricting and embarrassing - you only have to regurgitate an oesophagus full of chewed food over a plate to realise what a bummer of a condition this is. It may not be life threatening, but it is certainly not fun! I wish everyone with the condition every best wish in managing their condition. PS - I really struggle with my weight and am now 5 stone overweight which must be a record for achalasia!!! Would love to hear from anyone in a similar position. 7 likes, 120 replies "

My esophagus has since tightened back up and eating is very difficult, but it is nothing compared to the   I get. I’ve been experiencing this pain off and on for as long as I can remember. The first time I experienced it, I thought I was having a heart attack. The pain will sometimes radiate through my chest, into my jaw and down my arms. It can last anywhere from 15 minutes to agonizing HOURS. I’ve tried tracking the food I eat or the activities I do to see if there’s some sort of pattern or connection in hopes of finding out what causes it, but I can’t seem to put the pieces together. There is no rhyme or reason to it. It can happen in the middle of the day while I’m at work, or it will sometimes wake me up in the middle of the night. I can go weeks without having it and then all of the sudden have it every day. It’s almost paralyzing, and I’m not being dramatic. I’ve been to my doctor dozens of times and nothing we’ve tried seems to work. Does anyone experience something similar? If so, is there anything that helps you relieve the pain?

Oesophageal Achalasia and Spasm,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/poem-available-in-toronto-519932,POEM available in Toronto,"Hello friends, I want to use this thread to connect with other Achalasia patients in Canada and especially to let them know about the availability of POEM (Per Oral Endoscopic Myotomy) in Toronto. A bit about myself to begin with: I am a 31 yo female who started experiencing swallowing difficulties about a year and half back. With time, my symptoms got worse and I could not keep down any food that I ate. I would like to let fellow sufferers know that eating only when standing did help me with this. I could eat soft foods and keep most of it by eating while standing and then walking for next 10-15 mins. I would consume a lot of green smoothies and other type of smoothies fortified with protein powders. This was instrumental in helping me not loose too much weight and keep up my energy levels overall. The need to get treated intensified for me when the cardiospasm episodes started becoming more frequent. They would hit without any notice or trigger and leave me completely exhausted and awefully fearful of the next episode. It caused a lot of self-imposed social isolation as well. I researched online for an Achalasia expert in Toronto/Ontario and I learned that Dr. Gail Darling and Dr. Andrew Pierre (at Toronto General Hostpital) were the authorities on the subject (along with other GI disorders). I was able to get an appointment with Dr. Pierre who is an exceptionally smart and kind individual. After a number of medical tests, we were able to make a formal diagnosis of Achalasia. While explaining the various options to me, he kindly let me know that he speacilaizes in Heller's Myotomy which is a tried and tested procedure. When asked about POEM, he suggested I speak with one of his collegues at TGH Dr. Eran Shlomovitz. After speaking with Dr. Shlomovitz, I was convinced that a minimally invasive procedure done endoscopically was the one for me. We were able to secure a surgery date within next 40 days. I went through the procedure last week and I am happy to report that my initial observations are great. I am able to eat soft foods without any trouble now and there's no pain associated with swallowing. I do experience mild chest pains sometimes but I believe its due to my body receovering yet. These should vanish as the time goes by. I would also like to mention the worry free experience of the surgery and in hospital care at the TGH. Dr. Shlomovitz's team and the extended nursing team showed amazing professionalism and empathy in taking care of me. I'd be happy to provide additional information to anyone. Please reach out to me on this forum. I hope you and your loved ones too find a good doctor and relief from your symtoms. Much Metta, take care! 1 like, 47 replies "

Oesophageal Achalasia and Spasm,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/so-frightened-and-stuck-691695,So frightened and stuck ,"hi my names Allison I'm having lots of trouble at the moment with eating it all started 3 years ago when I nearly chocked on some food ever since that happened I have been paranoid about eating . ever since that chocking episode food did start sticking at the top of my throat and I would need water to push it down my throat. one week ago while I was eating food started to come back up my esophagus/throat and ever since every thing I eat comes back up . the food comes back up while I'm still eating so naturally I panic and doubt eat any more , I also get a tight feeling in my throat when this is happening. The strangest thing about all this is one week before this started my fear of chocking on food became super crazy bad I was so scared to eat that every bit of food I chewed was getting stuck at the top of my throat or I'd try to swallow the food and my throat wouldmt let me . Then this new feeling started with feeling as if foods coming stright back up while I'm still eating ... I'm booked in for a special xray to check my swallowing but I'm going crazy is this all possible that my minds done this ? or have I actually developed the very thing I was so frightened of the last 3 years ? I've seen 4 doctors and gotten told its Gord or Gasitits  , A ulcer so 3 different diagnoses?All this started one week ago Any help would be appropriate I'm very stuck here I suffer from terrible anxiety and I'm in a panic 0 likes, 6 replies "
Oesophageal Achalasia and Spasm,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/recieved-my-barium-swallow-test-results-692255,Recieved my barium swallow test results ,"I had a barium swallow test on Tuesday and it came back that I have a moderate narrowing of the esophagus from a artery that is behind my esophagus and has pushed into my esophagus. The artery is not supposed to be there and its something I'm born with , apparently its quite rare which is just fantastic. The strange thing is were the narrowed part is I'm not having any feelings of food blocking or sticking there but a feeling of eaten food coming up into my throat. The doctor said if it was blocking my food that narrowed part I would feel a chocking sensation but iam not , he believes the food feeling in my throat is from acid reflux. The sensation of food being in my throat only started 3 weeks ago before that I had absolutely no issues with food coming up , so the doctors say my throat wouldn't off narrowed that much overnight  . The only explanation for why the foods going down the narrowed part is maybe my esophagus has become more flexible as I was born with this . But I was told that my esophagus may have slowly narrowed over my life . The people that did my barium test said that when I drank the barium it did not get stuck at the narrowed part it went stright down no hesitation at all  , and it was a very thick drink. I'm having another barium test this Tuesday but it's going to be slightly different to see if thicker stuff does slow down or block up . And on Wednesday I'm seeing a specialist and I'll go from there. To be honest I'm frightened out of my mind not knowing what's happening and weather I'll choke I'm at the point were I'm hardly eating out of pure fear , I'm sticking to runny yogurt and soup I seem to manage rice cakes with grilled cheese.. Because what I have is so rare no one can give me information about this so I'm so stuck at the moment and on top of all this I suffer from OCD so I'm obsessing badly about this now  , I'm really scared that I'm going to choke .

All the tests show normal ,"I have been having chronic   for a year now, and have difficulty swallowing on top of it, which started  a couple weeks of constipation. My bowel movements are really weird. Sometimes I have a sensation of going to the washroom then it stops a few minutes later. Other times, I would have to wait a while to have a bowel movement. Most of the times I feel there is still feces stuck in my rectum but no matter how much I push, it's still there. I had a  , the result is normal. As for difficulty swallowing, I always feel food get stuck on the way down. It would come down eventually. I burp a lot then I would feel some of the food got moved. Sometimes I burp,  a few pieces of food would come back up. I went for barrium swallow, and motility test, which all showed normal. Does anyone out there have the same problems? Please let me know if they would eventually go away or it's a condition I have to live with. Would it get worst? Thank-you so much! 0 likes, 4 replies "
Oesophageal Achalasia and Spasm,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/problems-with-swallowing-because-of-multiple-cervical-fusions-697243,Problems with swallowing because of  multiple cervical fusions,"Hi all, I have had all my cervical discs fused. Well for the  six years I had issues with swallowing and last year an ENT doctor had me do a swallowing test and sure enough the rods and screws in my neck cause my flap in my throat to hit against the plates and well I can barely swallow and I choke on food. So I have to eat basically over cooked veggie and bean watered soup and liquids. I have lost tons  weight and still losing. Also now pain is developed in the neck along with feeling like I am being waterboarded and drowning, it is the worst feeling all the time like I am being choked.  I was told they cannot remove the rods and screws it is to dangerous.  They pit me through a speech therapy and all of that too. I am getting worse and I am at my wits end. Has anyone else gone through this where you can barely swallow and your throat hurts all the time and you feel like your drowning or feeling like you are being choked? If so did you get and help if so how? I am desperate for relief. 0 likes, 6 replies "

I've had an Itchy, sore and swollen anus for about a week now and no signs of it clearing. It itches intensely throughout the day and the only way to calm it and to stop it from being so sore is using coconut oil. Any ideas what it could be? I thought maybe it could be a fissure but there is no tear. It only bleeds when I wipe after pooing which I think is from the soreness of the skin. It's also waking me up in the early hours of the morning with intense itching and burning. Images Thanks 0 likes, 2 replies "

Although it has prevented further joint damage in my left foot, I continue to have seen some deterioration in the right foot with the metatarsal arch collapsing as well as planter fasciitis symptoms. Recently I was advised by my dermatologist that I should consider trying biologics (like enbrel) as he says that they are ""game changing"" vs Dmards and less toxic. My rheumatologist thinks I'm doing fine (compared to his other patients) but I continue to have difficulty walking any distances, and I'm concerned about further foot damage. Has anyone had similar experiences and can you offer advice on how to proceed with possibly changing medications? Should I get a second opinion from another rheumatologist? Also how much insurance coverage would I expect to receive on this class of drug? Thanks Doug  0 likes, 3 replies "
