Sleep Disorders,https://www.drugs.com/answers/while-on-seroquel-for-several-month-i-began-428983.html,Has anyone experienced insomnia while taking Seroquel?,"While on Seroquel (for several month), I began experiencing severe insomnia, sometimes getting 1 or 2 hours of sleep a night... and many,many nights, ZERO hours of sleep. This, of course, took me off of work. Dr. decided @ that point to take me off the Seroquel ('clean out my system and start over'). The whole process took about 2 months until I started to feel halfway normal again. After speaking to the Dr. and telling him I still wasn't getting enough sleep after returning to work (2 or so hours a night), his response was he did not know what to tell me. I assume he did not want to put me on any sleep medication. I started Melatonin on my own and finally began to get some relief. Now that I am not on Seroquel, I find that I do not require the amount of sleep that I did while taking it. However, due to that, being nocturnal by nature, I have a tendency to short myself sleep wise even though I know it is not in my best interest and that I am an adult and should be able to go to bed when I should!

Thyroid Disease,https://www.drugs.com/answers/warning-do-not-take-armour-thyroid-if-you-are-424540.html,WARNING: DO NOT TAKE ARMOUR THYROID IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO PORK!! I was put on Armour Thyroid by my,"... physician about 2 years ago even though I informed him that I had been diagnosed with a pork allergy. I did not realize that Armour Thyroid came from pigs. I developed some very unpleasant symptoms including a daily fever (101-103) every day for over seven months. I also had extreme itching on my scalp and started experiencing inflammation and joint stiffness. When I asked him if these could be side effects of the medication, he said no. He also had me taking an iodine supplement to increase absorption of the med. I asked him to test my thyroid levels and he said he preferred to go by how I felt. Well, I felt awful and I had my other doctor monitor my levels and he kept telling me that I was over-medicated and was hyper instead of hypo. I discontinued the Armour ONE day when going for a CT scan and I could not believe the difference in how I felt. I weaned myself off of the Armour, started on Levothyroxin and feel like I have my life back. I called Forrest Pharmaceuticals and they said I definitely should not have been placed on Armour if I had a pork allergy. NONE of my doctors were aware of this (I have many of them due to various health issues and I always tell them of my pork and gluten allergies), so I'm posting this, so that I can help someone else avoid what I went through "

Taken cipro many times with no problem?,"I am prone to uti's. I am 30 years old and have been getting them since I was a child. I have been given cipro countless times for uti's with no adverse reactions. I recently developed another uti and began taking cipro as usual, but by the third day I began to itch all over my body. I stopped the cipro at this point, but the itching has not subsided and it has been three days since I stopped taking it. I also get some burning sensation on my skin and a little tingly at times. It is worse at night and I haven't had a good nights sleep since this started. This is driving me CRAZY and I have found little to nothing to really stop the itching. The most relief I get is when I soak in a bath with baking soda. I feel extremely run down most of the time. I am also having bouts of chills and just being generally cold while others are comfortable. This is unusual for me because I am usually hot when others are cold. I am getting some nagging feelings of depression as well that I am trying to snap out of. I have done some research on cipro and other antibiotics in the same family and have found experiences of others that are very similar to mine. I have also found some incredibly terrible and frightening potential side effects that have been deadly to more than just a few and some have expressed that they wished they were dead rather than experience the ill effects from these drugs. I am trying to not overreact, but I am concerned. If this is from the cipro, will it subside? Or will it only get worse? Should I worry that it is something else causing my symptoms? Anyone with any insight would be greatly appreciated.

I thought one day treatment meant that the medicine would both work, and absorb within a day. Boy was I wrong. Not to be too graphic but I felt up there to see if the medicine was gone this morning and it's EVERYWHERE. Its like it hasn't totally absorbed, it's just sitting up there. Of course it's not in its original capsul form anymore, it's like a wet powdery medicine though just sitting up there, and I don't like it! Does anyone know how long it takes for this to go away?! How long does it take for the medicine to actually completely absorb? Also, does anyone know how long after using the medicine you're supposed to wait before having sex?

Thyroid Disease,https://www.drugs.com/answers/armour-thyroid-armour-causing-numerous-unbearable-2515817.html,Armour Thyroid - Help! Armour is now causing numerous unbearable side effects for me!?,"HELP!! I am really suffering here! I was diagnosed with Graves' disease in 1996. Had to swallow radioactive iodine, which I now deeply regret after learning more. I am now turning 46 years old. I spent 15 years on synthroid which resulted in many negative, intolerable side effects and my quality of life deteriorated. A naturalist doctor convinced me to try Armour. I couldn't stay with that doctor for regulation as she cost $400/visit out of pocket and due to my terrible health, I am now a retired educator on a fixed income. My regular primary care ( who was supposedly an Endocrinologist as well) went ahead and switched me to Armour and placed me on 60mg daily ( pills to swallow, not dissolve- what are those?). She was very uninvolved with my dosing and seemed to be unfamiliar or unfavorable toward Armour. She dropped the meds on me and did nothing else- not even when I had to make an emergency call to her because I literally couldn't move from severe muscle locking. I switched to a new primary care who is patient and returns calls, but who seems very unsure of how to dose me. In the last 2 years being on Armour more and more side effects are occurring and they're unbearable now. My new doctor tried 60 mg alternating with 90 when my numbers said I wasn't getting enough medication. But on 60/90 the blood tests indicated I was getting too much medicine! 60mg alone was giving me leg cramps and ""locking"" (I couldn't move). My doctor recently tried 75 mg by using a 60mg and a 15 mg together - taken orally as two pills in the morning well before food. My body is in agony! Massive leg cramps and Charlie horses, terribly rapid racing heartbeat, racing thoughts, inability to sleep or concentrate, can't focus, eyes feeling ""coated"", irritability, irrationality... Pretty much every negative side effect listed for armour thyroid! I should add that for over a year now my monthly cycle has gone wild and each month my breasts swell dramatically as if I'm pregnant and I have several other pregnancy symptoms, as well as bloating and weight gain, that all settle down once my period arrives ( which recently arrived after only two weeks and I am a 28 day cycle regular person). My doc tested for female hormonal changes and found nothing. Not sure what he tested exactly. Feeling pregnant and nauseous and smelling everything x10 and my breasts getting large and sore monthly is AWFUL!!! No I haven't been pregnant/ I've tested just in case.- This doesn't make any sense. None of it! On alternating 60/90mg of Armour my heart raced (indicating too much med). On 60mg my legs cramped (indicating too little med). Added in 15mg to create 75mg and now BOTH things are happening plus many other side effects. Am I allergic to Armour? Could I have a bad batch of meds and does that exist since each pig is different? Are formulations different company to company? Is adding the little 15 mg to the 60 mg a ""No -No?"" Could the 15mg be a bad batch? What are the dissolvable pills I hear people mention? Have I developed a resistance or reaction to Armour? Someone help please! I can't live like this. My life is virtually stopping because every move I make pulls muscles and my heart is constantly racing as if I'm being attacked and must run for my life. I seem to have conflicting symptoms- meaning I have the side effects of both too much and too little medicine!! Should I try nature-throid which I just heard about yesterday? Something else? Is there a T3 supplement because my former doctor never even offered that to me while I was on synthroid. As stated, she was a very poor doctor. My current doctor is kind but doesn't seem to know how/what to dose. HELP!! "

Seizures,https://www.drugs.com/answers/i-have-some-questions-about-side-effects-of-keppra-110306.html,I have some questions about side effects of Keppra?,"Hi I am a new member and am concerned about the side effects of Keppra. I started having grand mal seizures at the age of 29 and I am now 37. Over the course of a few years I came to learn that I have a birth defect in my left frontal lobe that is causing the seizures. I only have them in my sleep and they are not frequent(3-4 a year).  Once I started on Keppra in fall 2007 the seizures were reduced.I have only had 3 since Oct. 07. However since that time I have encountered problems with auras. These auras are not followed by seizures but are very painful and interupt my seep in the early am.  As a result of these auras, I went to the Mayo clinic to see if removal of the defect in my brain is an option-it isn't. The doctor at Mayo upped my Keppra from 3000 mg's a day to 4000mg's a day to see if this would stop the auras. It has to some extent, but ever since that time, I have had problems with side-effects.  At times my mind races terribly, and I have strange thoughts which I cannot control. I had to stop smoking pot as a result( something I thought would never happen!) because this would only intesify my anxiety and racing thoughts. It is not a constant problem, but some days it becomes very tiresome.  I would like to mention that I am a full-time student and work full time as a concrete finisher and in a relationship with a very loving woman who has two sons (7,and 9) and we have a 14 month old daughter together. I am happy with my home life and feel good about work and school. It just feels like something is different inside me since I upped the Keppra dosage.  Today I talked to the Mayo doctor and he agreed that I should go back down to 3000mg's a day. He also indidcated that I might try Tegratol in addition to lowering my Keppra dose to see if that would control my auras. This worries me because when I read the side effects of Tegratol it included mental hyperactivity! I have always been an anxious person, but never enough to affect my daily life.  I am sure that my new life as a father is some of the cause of stress/anxiety but I have never had the obssesions I have had over the last few months. Worrying that I am going crazy, worring why i am worried about going crazy! Afraid to be creative because I am worried about never coming back from the creative process etc. Does anyone else feel this way? Is this normal with Keppra? I know 4000mg's a day is high. I am quite sure my anxiety has increased since I started having seizures, that seems natural. Does anyone have any suggestions or thoughts? Thanks so much! "

I was diagnosed 4 1/2 years ago however I believe I had Diabetes for much longer. As a teenager (16) I started having seizures in my sleep. Thinking back I believe that those seizures were from low blood sugar. I remember having the symptoms of low blood sugar all throughout my teen years. I took Dilantin off and on from age 16 - 40 when I took myself off the medication. Since getting my blood sugar under control - I have stopped having seizures all together. All of the sudden 3 months ago I began having extremely painful Neuropathy along with numbness from feet to abdomen. I started taking Gabapentin 600mg 3 Xs a day. That didn't help the pain so they upped the dose to 800mg 3Xs a day and added Naproxen 500mg 2 Xs a day. Next I started Lyrica 100mg 3Xs a day. The pain got so bad I was hospitalized for 12 days. While in the hospital a Dr. added Cymbalta 30mg in the morning. After the hospitalization I feel the pain is just as strong as the day I went to the E.R.

When will they stop?,"My wife is currently taking Tramadol, Xanax and Mianserin. She used to take Carbamazepine but complained about gaining weight as a result of it.  Back in early October she quit Carbamazepine cold turkey and I told her that is probably not a good idea because I have heard that going off any med is not a good idea. I had no idea that seizures could be a result of this action. So 3 weeks later on Halloween she had a non-epileptic seizure which freaked us both out. That night I made her get back on the Carbamazepine and in a few days she was back on it at 300mg per day.  I told her that while I do not like the idea of her being on this drug, I felt it would be safer if she went back on it and slowly went off of it over the course of 2 months. We both agreed to this. My new role became nurse and I would administer her meds to her each day. I also had to make sure she did not take more than her daily dose of Tramadol and Xanax as she had developed an addiction to them and had been abusing them behind my back over the course of 5 months.  Stress had been building up in our home and we decided to take a break. She went to spend time at her brother's 2 weeks ago but I was apprehensive to let her go fearing she would start abusing Tramadol and Xanax again and quit Carbamazepine.  This past week, during a phone call, she admitted to quitting Carbamazepine cold turkey after having another seizure that day. Today she admitted to having yet another seizure. So she has had a total of 2 seizures with in a 2 week time period after quitting Carbamazepine cold turkey.  What I would like to know is when these non-epileptic seizures will stop or if she needs to go back on Carbamazepine again and slowly go off it over the course of 2 months like we had originally planned. Any ideas? "

So, she wrote a prescription for Ropinrole then passed along the prescription to be handled by my psychiatrist. I began showing weird symptoms and call my psych doc about it and she waved it off like I was worrying about nothing. She said to stop talking it for a week to see if I noticed a changed, after I had taken it for two months increasing the dose each month from .25 to .50mg. I looked the drug up on this website and my symptoms were listed under severe allergic reactions. I stopped taking that medication completely and after a month, my symptoms totally disappeared.

Help please?,"I had my first general (grand mal) seizure in August of 2009. That was a combination of 3 things; dehydration, heat exhaustion and (the main one) withdraw from Benzodiazepines. I was taking anywhere from 2-6mg of xanax and/or 30-100mg of valium daily just for recreational purposes. Good part is, I'm past that now! That was a low time in my life that I'm not particularly proud of...  Anyway...  I had my second general seizure on the 12th of this month. I hadn't been taking any drugs or doing anything totally out of the ordinary this time. I had some weird spurts where I was like ""glitching"" it was really weird. I was like... losing half a second of time. It took me a little over 6 minutes to write a 3 line e-mail. Really weird stuff. I text my wife saying that I thought I was having mini strokes or mini seizures or something and I needed some help. She didn't reply so I started walking to where she was, she caught up with me coming the other way and noticed I was walking funny... I was losing just enough time to almost fall but catch myself. She helped me back into the office, she got on the computer and logged onto WebMD.com looking for info on mini seizures. I sat on my other desk since she was in the chair and the next thing I remember is waking up in the elevator on the stretcher with the EMT's. Even then I was really confused for the next several minutes. They gave me a million blood tests and they all came back normal. I just saw my neurologist today and his exact words were ""It's a stone cold normal exam!"" so that was really comforting... Not! As soon as I mentioned my little ""glitchy"" thing he seemed like he knew exactly what was going on. He then mentioned how he as a Neurologist in Texas has to retake his exams every 10 years and he just finished his not too long ago. During his class for a refresher or whatever he saw a case almost exactly like mine except it was a woman and about every 5-7 seconds she would kind of just stare into space and lose herself. She and I were most likely doing the same thing. The common name for it is ""Staring Spells"" believe it or not. The medical term is ""Partial Complex Seizures"" they are like little mini seizures that just last a split second. I only had them the 12th-14th. The Doc wants to make sure though by putting me on this medicine called ""Lamictal XR"" a super safe anti-convulsant. So safe they give it to pregnant ladies. I go back to see him in 5 weeks to get the results of the next 2 tests he wants me to take. He wants me to get an MRI of my head and an EEG before I see him next. I'm not really sure how much the tests are going to help though. He said that since I'm not epileptic, MRI's have a really small chance of catching what it is that's going on (like 5%-10%) and EEG's are better but not by much. He also told me that 70% of studies in Britain have no clue what causes Partial Complex Seizures. They never found out what caused that lady to have hers either.  So, that's what's been goin on with me so far... Crazy part is, I feel fine! Any thoughts? Anyone? "

The first time was after smoking about a gram of cannabis across a period of three hours. I felt panic and like I was going to throw up or pass out, not knowing which it was going to be I headed to the bathroom. As soon as I saw the mirror I saw colorful lights flashing across the mirror (i have never taken psychedelics but I would relate this to what I've heard about them), I spun around and lost consciousness for a few seconds. I stopped smoking for a while after this.. About six months later I was having a few beers with my family; I was trying to be carfull, only drinking one beer an hour. When I was halfway through my third beer (in the third, perhaps fourth hour) I got up to get something to drink and felt a surge of energy rush into my head: it felt like it was lit up with lights. I laid down and the next morning I was fine. Again I stopped drinking for a period of time. But then, about two months later when I drank about 4 glasses of wine at thanksgiving I did not have any problem. My last occasion was again with Cannabis, but I only had two hits and after watching tv for thirty minutes, my heart began to race and I started having a panic attack fearing I would have a heart attack. I took deep breaths to try to calm myself down. Once my heart was at a more normal pace my legs began to twitch violently and stopped a couple minutes later.

So I have had two seizures and I am 20 years old. I have been taking tramadol for a little bit of time now. I have never had a problem with seizures before. My mother who is an extreme alcoholic has seizures when she withdraws (detoxes) from alcohol not from overdosing. I did take a lot (about six to ten 100 mg tramadols a day). I never once had a seizure. My first time was when I was visiting in LA at a college campus. It was about 3 in the afternoon and I had not eaten yet. At all. And I was probably severely dehydrated because I don't remember drinking much water. Just a pepsi here and there and a red bull. I am a physically fit young man so I never thought anything of taking so many. And on this day, I didn't take more than I usually do. But I guess due to the heat, not eating, or drinking factoring in I am not sure if I overdosed or not. Again like I said I took anywhere from 6-10 like I usually do. I know this is a lot but it wasn't out of the ordinary for me. All I remember was I twitched once really bad. My friends started laughing. I chalked it up to the red bull. Then I did it again and dropped my cell phone. All I remember was my friends voice starting to fade and him putting his hand on my waist and the back of my head and squeezing me into him and yelling for someone to call 911. The rest I don't remember. I woke up on the ground. My second one happened when I was in China for a school trip. These seizure are only spaced about a month a part. I thought I was going to be fine. But I had a problem with the food there, so I wasn't eating (first mistake). It was really hot. I felt it coming on so I ran back in side the restaurant and went into the bathroom stall and locked the door. i was hoping to calm my self down. it didn't work. i woke up outside throwing up. one of the guys in our group is a certified EMT and followed me to the bathroom for some reason. he ended up kicking the door down when i wasn't responding and found me on the ground. so i am a little worried. i stopped taking them. i was detoxing for a while, but i am fine now. i know i was dumb to take that many. but each seizure i was taking a different kind of tramadol. the first one was a tablet form (same mg) the second one was capsule form (same mg). I was told that the capsule is less strong, so thats why I asked for that one instead. Do you guys believe I just overdosed each time, due to lack of nutrients and sustenance. or could it be something mechanically wrong with my brain? the first one i had i was taken to the hospital and they did a cat scan, nothing wrong. but the second one was in a third world country so i couldn't go to the doctor.

I went to the Dr. when I was curious about symptoms I was having that were very similar to ADHD, but I wasn't sure and I didn't want to diagnose myself so I got checked out. This was not the only problems I was having, I was suffering from insomnia, fatigue at all hours, no energy what so ever, and absolutely no motivation. He ended up diagnosing me with ADHD and put me on Adderall XR 20mg once a day, and Ambien 5mg at bedtime. These medications were a miracle and have significantly improved my sleep, energy, motivation, mood, anxiety/depression, and my ADHD symptoms. I have a few questions regarding the medications, mainly the Adderall, I also have seizures and am prescribed Keppra 500mg 2x a day. When I take the Keppra I'm typically fine, but when I stop for a day or two, it's almost definite that one will trigger, and I've never experienced a trigger for my seizures (is that normal?). Will this medicine conflict with my Keppra and cause me to have seizures or should I be fine? Adderall has helped tremendously but it hasn't solved all my ADHD problems, is it also possible that I may need an instant release to go along with it, or maybe a higher dosage? Also will any of the follow medications conflict with Adderall as I also have a prescription for them: Ambien, Fiorciet, Keppra. My doctor did something a bit strange when I was prescribed the Adderall, he took off my Effexor 150mg once a day, and my Buspar 15mg twice a day and told me to stop them completely. Is that typically normal or can it act as an anti-depressant as well? As I said I was recently diagnosed and I'm 19, is it possible for symptoms to start a little later in your life? This also happened with my seizures which started when I was 17(what could cause this to happen?).

I was prescribed Levothyroxine. I also took a multivitamin containing 600mg of Calcium, along with 5,000IU of vitamin D. I was unaware of the warning not to take Calcium & Iron while taking that medication within a 4 hour period of time... until now.  I started taking the thyroid medication at the end of Februrary, 26th, and within a week or so of taking Levothyroxine I was experiencing a vicious headache. It started on a Friday afternoon and on until Saturday afternoon. I saw a physician at an urgent care center that Saturday who prescribed Amoxicillian. Within 24 hours I had a reaction which I thought was from taking that medication. I could feel my left ear was red and itchy so I went back to the urgent care center on Sunday. It was suggested I see an ENT because my left ear had become inflamed.   It wasn't until Tuesday that I was able to get in to see an ENT because the left side of my face was red with little bumps on my cheek along with the very inflamed left ear. She diagnosed me with Cellulitis and acute Shingles. She was worried about the Cellulitis & prescribed me Cefuroxime and Acyclovir.   In the meantime, I spoke with another doctor regarding the thyroid medication since my doctor was out of town. He suggested I take a different thyroid supplement rather than Levothyroxine because I had concerns as to whether the thyroid medication was causing me problems. I just went back to the ENT a few days ago, Tuesday, becasue I was concerned with puffiness under my left eye. The good news from that visit was that the Cellulitis was clearing up. The question still remained..what was causing the puffiness under my left eye? Was the Shingles growing in my body? The doctor seemed to think I was experiencing an allergic reaction to something since I had not complained of any nerve pain or other extreme pain related to Shingles... I only had little red bumps and was very itchy. She prescribed Prednisone and it seems the ithiness and red bumps are slowly going away. Now, after saying all of that, I am wondering what caused my Cellulitis in the first place.. was there a correlation between the Levothyroxine and Calcium and vitamin D levels in my body? Was it caused by something else? How would I know whether I do have the Shingles virus? I would like to hear some feedback from patients who have experienced this and or from doctors or allergists or dermatologist who can give me advice about drug interactions. Any or all comments would be greatly appreciated! Thank you to all who can offer advice about my concerns! -Maria "

While I previously slept 2-3 hours a night (which I could function on), I now am awake for 3 or 4 days at a time, until I ""crash and burn."" i no longer have any energy (although Adderall helps a bit), I have missed a lot of class, and I have no social life anymore because I always feel to sick/weak to do anything. Some of the symptoms I have are: - Neuropathy Pain & Numbness (had a ulnar transposition on both arms) - Migraines - Blurry Vision - Weight loss (40lbs in two months) - Dizziness - Constantly sick due to poor immune system - Memory loss - Jittery - Fever or Cold Sweats - Difficulties keeping track of time (miss a lot of appointments) - Allergies & IBS (Unrelated) One symptom that has me a bit worried though (and I usually never worry) is that I get random muscle contractions/spasms that last 1-4 seconds, sometimes a few seconds longer. Feels like I'm having a heart attack and seizure at the same time. Usually when the ""episodes"" occur I feel like I can't breath and have to hold onto something or sit down because I feel I'm going to faint. Most sleep docs I've been to, even at Standford, have said I won't be around very long if my sleep isn't fixed, so not a good outlook. Although I try to stay positive I do have a ""feeling of doom."" My symptoms seem similar to sporadic fatal insomnia. I know its very rare, but SFI is caused by a gene mutation in the brain and the reason I have Neuropathy and CMT is due to me having a gene mutation in the brain...  So my question is are the recent changes in my sleep a sign that my health is rapidly deteriorating? Also, do you think the ""episodes"" I am experiencing are seizures? Thanks for your help. "

It's been bad since then. He experienced something that he called dizziness from 2008. it used to come once a year and lately maybe 3 times a week sometimes. It would come out of a sudden, he looks like trying to swallow something as his mouth felt dry, and the dizziness plus headaches after. There is no loss of conciousness but only he couldnt concentrate for a few seconds.This would only happend at home.,while driving he would be aware and pull the car on the side until he would be better(matter of seconds). Finally he went to the doctor, where he got an MRI and EEG,the MRI show nothing to worry tho the EEG shows abnormal activity in frontotemporal lobe. Considering the history and the result the diagnosis was sadly epilepsy and the treatment given is Lamictal, started with 25mg, now he is at 50. It was a struggle for him to accept the idea, we checked with one more neurologist, same diagnosis. Now he said because of the Lamictal he has horrible mood swings, his head is sometimes so busy with thoughts, other times calm. Luckily no seizures stopped. But tell me please did anyone go through this. Is it Lamictal giving this mood swings or just the idea of having this disease??? I feel useless because I don't know how to help him to go through this. If anyone experienced something like this please leave a comment. Thank you, Wish you all health "

A brief description of myself: im 22, male. around 14.5 stone, muscly build. Go gym 3 times a week. Have suffered with depression 2 year ago and was on medication for that. The last year i have been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks. Most panic attacks result in me being physicaly sick and can sometimes become a repetative P/A where i end up having to take 5mg Diazepam to sort myself out, otherwise i get stuck in a loop of building up to anxiety, being sick then feeling okay for 5 minutes, then it all starts again and keeps doing that. I have been prescribed 200mg sertraline tablets for my anxiety. Have been on sertraline for around a year now. When i first started it was 100mg per day, then a few month later it was increased to 150mg. Then around 8 week ago it was upped to 200mg per day. This was due to the tablets not being effective enough for me. I have not felt dizzy in the past whilst taking sertraline. However since Monday afternoon I have been feeling dizzy and still feel rather dizzy right now. Here is a few things to take into consideration that might be causing this: - I have missed my medication since saturday due to forgeting about it. I have just taken the 200mg this morning incase it was due to not taking them? - I have not been eating or drinking as much as normal due to feeling dizzy. - I wear glasses that may be causing this? However i didnt wear them for the most of yesterday and still was rather dizzy. It might not have anything to do with the medication and i might have some bug that makes you dizzy? I dont know. This is why i am seeking help on here. Hopefully someone can help me out a little?

I take 3 meds for blood pressure 1)Triam/HCTZ 50-25; 2)Amlodipine Besylate 5mg; and 3)Metoprolol 25mg. The reason I take 3 meds is because I tend to have bad side effects to other things. Do any of you have (or have you heard of) palpitations and dizziness from any of these meds? I did just google the Amlodipine and Metoprolol, and the palpitations can be a side effect, but I don't know about the dizziness. I'm concerned about a possible heart problem; however, I had this about 10 years ago, and nothing was wrong with my heart. Your input would be appreciated. StarGlitter. Note: I also have a severe panic disorder (that I've had for over 40 years) - but this was never one of my symptoms. "

Side effects decreasing?","Hello! New to the site, wanted to share my experience and hopefully get some positive comments and tips!. 24 y/o male (strong and traiend, nice job, international lawyer recently graduated, nice carrer prospects, musician and singer, pretty content overall [spoiler: now that i'm getting better haha] I've been through extensive and intense pressure and stress the last year, i've always been anxious as well. This cocktaill induced depersonalization episodes that became more a more prominent and long-lasting to the point of beign 24/7 in that state for a month, maybe month and a half. (True HELL if anyone has been there knows what i'm talking about, i could hardly explain what it is like be on that ""realm"") via meditation, insight, research and work (relaxing is work to someone like me too haha) i was able to get out of there (i was lucky and strong enough to never leave my activities and force myself to go on with my life, i repeat, it was hell). So iwas out but severe panic attacks started, last week i was on the E.R, i tought myself dying, and i was working, therefore big warning sign.  Long story short, after almost a year, decided to get help, went to a psychiatrist. He put me on lexapro 5mg for 4 days, then i amped it up to 10. Been a week and oh boy, what a week. Btw the psy, Great man, very comprehensive, i really trust him, straightforward, no bs. I've had side effects? Yes, many, thisss dizziness (not like nausea, more like a pre panic attack state), proper nausea in the morning (very little), strange feeling in the back of the tongue, and a few very minor panick attacks (i stress, very minor in time and intensity that have decreased and haven't had them in the past three days) I would say this, the drug helps but you gotta help it, the previous days i would google symptoms and read horror stories, not helpful mate, i would concentrate too much in what was happening in my body. Here i get to the point: also (the one that worries me) the first days i had this relatively short episodes of euphoria, like feeling pumped and happy for no reason (i've read too many horror stories, i know i shouldn't, i don't know if it really was for NO reason). I did not do anything crazy apart from eating some sweets (strict diet, very committed to calisthenics, training), buut was not so baad i guess haha. I felt like enjoying my recovery but also want to be aware of anything i... well, should be aware of haha. I, personally was happy for finally having done something about my problem after being ""in the dark"" for so long, and i still am. In this ""episodes"" i was happily walking down the street, smiling, kind to everyone (did not have a crash or depression after), this has not happened again, not even when i started with 10mg (nevertheless side effects instensified, and started to decrase again, normal I guess). But i'm afraid of it happening again, idk, just afraid of being bipolar or smething (please forgive my ignorance if i'm saying something stupid or harmful to anyone here) Sorry for the excesive post if i must, but then again: Should i be worried about any of these things? I'm worried about having one of this maniac things, which makes suspicious of being happy, is this stupid? Haha. I'am feeling better every day, as the side effects subside.  This is my first time here, so i hope everyone that reads this has a great day. If anyone should be on any of the stages i was or am now, stay strong, there is hope, and the will of your mind and heart can get you out of there if you work with it, keep it up!! Thanks in advance, truly helps to express myself. CF "

It has been about a month and a half away from that stressful environment, apparently causing most of my anxiety.When I woke up to paramedics in my face, they were asking about all my meds and when the last time i took my xanax was, i had to think about it and realized it had been about 4 days ago. (within those 4 days i felt completely fine, no anxiety, no withdrawal symptoms of any kind) they took me to the hospital and asured me the seizure was from that, suddenly not taking it for days and gave me a new script. Now i am all freaked out, waking up in the morning making sure to take small doses throughout the day. When i looked up Xanax and the side effects seizures were a rare side effect.. so Question 1, how can i be sure it was from the xanax n nothing more serious?

The left hip required a cup arthroplasty. Since then I have had three hip replacements on the left side. I used aspirin in fairly high quantities to control pain from 1950 until about 8 years ago when an ulcer was discovered which was treated successfully. I stopped using aspirin, but, not realizing that ibuprofen was similar to aspirin in causing inflammation, I started to use ibuprofen to control arthritic pain. Recently, because of arthritis in my lower back, I had a laminectomy resulting in extreme pain and, in order to get off percoset, started taking the maximum dose of 2400 mg of ibuprofen daily. It worked quite well. I had a blood test for another condition and discovered I was anemic. In order to find the reason for the anemia I had a colonoscopy and gastroendoscopy which uncovered another upper GI ulcer and some inflammation. I didn't make the connection between the anemia and large doses of ibuprofen immediately. As soon as I realized the anemia might be the result of the ibuprofen I stopped taking it.

I can't afford counseling right now. Just looking for some words of wisdom or anyone else who is struggling with this. Peace

Possibly become addicted or have seizures?? You all are making me worry: Hello, I too have been given tramadol, ultram (hydrochloride), whatever you want to call it, for migraines - 50mg little green capsule pills. I would get Ocular migraines caused by stress. They would get to the point I would loose my vision and have to lay down for about a half hour at a time. Then a minor headache would follow sometimes for almost two days non stop. I have now been on this drug for about three months. I can go days taking none (but not usually) or days taking one, and other days taking 2 and sometimes but rarely maybe 3! I get the same ""happy"" easy going, non worrying, way less stressing out, relaxed feeling from one pill as the first day I ever took one! So I guess everyone is different. Just wanted to say this pill has done wonders for my life and I am thankful for it. (I have not had a headache or Ocular migraine since). Also, FYI - It allows me to focus better on work and just smile and nod easier through out life and the things that get thrown my way! I do not take it about 6-7 hours before I know I will be sleeping because, for me, I can not sleep on it. I just lay there happily and feel good, but cant sleep. Oh and another thing, I had a problem with alcohol and partying and getting into trouble. Now I don't drink except maybe once a week and have no craving to even then. I am also perfectly content staying in on Fri and Sat nights when my friends call and want to go out. I would rather have them over here to just sit and talk or play video games etc... Its not like I am being anti-social. Oh and this drug also seems to help me do the house hold chores. I can clean like a mad man and be happy and have fun doing it. Seems like its a wonder drug huh? Well to me, it is! Thanks for listening - hope this helps someone and if anyone has any advise or precautions for me I am all ears. Thanks again, Iryna's man~ "

I am 26 years old and got married a couple of weeks ago! I've had 2 major seizures ever (May 2010 and June 2012) and so they said that means I have epilepsy. (I was taken to ER both times.)

I've tried several drugs and it seems that my body has a low tolerance to any of the side effects! I love my energy and I need it! I balled up in tears, a few months ago, as I managed to explain to my doctor that when I had taken the original dose of 200mg of vimpat, I had self-lowered it after less than a week, due to depressive feelings, suicidal thoughts (never before) as I told him that I recalled thinking ""how easy it would be to go stand on the train tracks"" ... ever since then, I've basically been terrified of the medication, but seem to feel okay at 25mg (I'm supposed to be taking at least 75).

I have a follow-up with my doctor next week and he needs to fill out a form for the DMV. I know he won't okay me driving if I'm not taking my medication, as instructed. We believe that stress highers my likelihood for a seizure, so I try to do my best to keep low stress. I tried taking lamotrigine for a little while and I don't really remember if I just gave up on it too quickly, or what exactly happened. My sister-in-law suggested I give it another try. I've also tried tegretol and keppra. ... any advice, please? Thank you! "

After stopping?,"Hi everyone, I have a question about lyrica.I was prescribed this drug yesterday by my doctor,because of my sciatica problem due to a disc protrusion in my low back.  My Family MD told me to try taking at night first before bed to see how it goes, then try to take it twice a day,once in the morning and once at night again.She prescribed 50 mg per pill. Anyways I took 1 pill of crappy drug yesterday around 3 pm,because the sciatica was bothering me,so I figured why not give it a shot now. Then the effects kicked in and I felt really tired and weak, but my sciatica was pretty much gone. I also noticed I would get some anxiety and I would slur my speech at times.I went to bad yesterday night and ended up having awful vivid nightmares. When I woke up in the morning,I felt kind of groggy,dizzy and weak. While lying in the coach the first half of the day,I noticed when I would get off the couch,that blood would rush to my head and I would get dizzy and my vision would get kind of hazy.The same feeling you get when you get up to fast. Except I wasn’t getting up too fast. I also had the feeling of being sort of off balance throughout the day.So I decided I would not take another dose of this drug. Bed time came again,and I can’t sleep at all. I have anxiety,I feel kind of lightheaded,sort of dizzy in a sense and some ringing in my right ear.It’s 1:50 am as I’m writing this. I did pop a 500 mg naproxen for my sciatica around 11 pm,but this never gave me anxiety,just the occasional heart palpitations and stomach cramps. My question is,what is going on with me? Is the lyrica I took yesterday doing this to me? I just took one 50 mg pill and decided not to take it after, and I am experiencing all these annoying side effects. Is it possible to have these side effects from one pill after I stopped taking it? Anyone have any ideas? I am real worried right now, and I don’t want to keep feeling this way. Please help. Dave "

Skin Rash,https://www.drugs.com/answers/mysterious-bug-bite-hives-2899474.html,Mysterious bug bite like hives come and go?,"I am a 27yo female living in a climate with very humid summers and very cold, wet winters. I have been experiencing frequent welts that appear and feel like mosquito bites all over my body on and off for a few years but they have gotten much worse lately for seemingly no apparent reason. I say ""bug bite like"" because I have been in my home with my 4 month old baby all summer with the windows closed and AC on so its very unlikely for that many Mosquitos to get into my home to bite me 8-10 times a day. I've also ruled out fleas and other biting bugs (2 indoor cats) because my husband and baby have no bites and the baby crawls around on the floor even. What is interesting is these raised bumps are sometimes small, the size of a pimple and sometimes clustered together at that size, or also big and irregular shapes like hives, sometimes all of those types are grouped together! They common factor is they itch like crazy and sometimes disappear by the next day or if they are in a highly itchy spot I scratch them until they scab but otherwise seem like they would disappear too. They appear to have a dot in them which strikes me as a characteristic of a bug bite but it could also be a swollen pore or hair follicle, I can't really tell. It does seem to be exacerbated by sweat or extreme heat like a hot shower, but not always the cause... I've had them appear anywhere from my home to work, restaurants asleep in a clean bed etc and I feel like if it was contagious my family would have gotten it by now especially my sensitive skinned newborn.   I've seen a dermatologist and they prescribed a steroid cream but said not to use long term, but it offered no relief and long term care/maintenance or a solid solution is what I'm seeking.  More background: I have many allergies... Medications, fragrances, oral food allergies, pollen etc but have made NO changes in the years I've been suffering. I use plain dial soap, all ""free"" detergents, body products etc and am very aware of food allergy reactions and these are not the typical reaction. The only change in my life is giving birth 4 months ago and it was a healthy, medicine free pregnancy and childbirth. It's gotten to the point that I'm itchy everywhere and so often that if a hair brushes against my skin I feel itchy all over because I'm so stressed about this rash. Any input would be appreciated!!!

The first week I instantly felt amazing. My symptoms were gone, my head felt clear and I had more energy and enthusiasm for life and getting things done. Exactly one week after I began feeling really “out of it” and a little down for a few hours. I felt fine later on and went out to eat and had a jumbo margarita. I felt a little drunk off of it and a couple hours later started a huge argument with my boyfriend out of nowhere and had kind of a very moody episode with tons of waterworks and craziness. The next morning I was feeling a little down, but not hungover at all, but had terrible anxiety and depression in the afternoon/late evening. Worst depression I’ve ever felt, which rolled over to the next morning and went away later in the day. I’ve felt fine since then. I have three questions. 1. Will I eventually feel great again like I will the first after the medication levels out in my system? 2. Is the alcohol the reason for my anxiety and depression the next night? I’m not usually depressed, and I think the meds and alcohol mixture was the blame for the crazy episode that night but would it still be affecting me more than 24 hours later enough to give me depression like that? Could it have anything to do with the amount of sugar I ingested? My mom takes lamotrigine and says if she has a lot of sugar it really affects her mood negatively.  3. My doctor asked me to lower my dosage to once a day due to the side effects. Will titrating down cause side affects like depression and anxiety to come up, or is that more likely with titrating up?

Recently, I've had a few scary experiences. For example, I will be sitting in my car during lunch, and my eyes will want to roll back or my vision will get blurry, I'll try to lay my head back but it makes me feel worse and i get kind of a tingly or light headed sensation, and then my stomach will feel sick and it is kind of hard to understand what someone is saying to me. For another example, I will be squatting at work stocking a shelf or something, someone starts talking to me and I'll stand up, and all of a sudden my vision goes black and my hearing seems to fade and I'll need to stop myself from falling over. Then, I'll get kind of a quick headache and a loss of breath. I've also been having burning tingling sensations in certain parts of my body, especially my right shoulder. I want to know if I am having maybe a small seizure or something else. I usually stay hydrated and I keep food in my stomach. I just don't want to spend a bunch of money on tests without a good opinion first. Thanks in advance. Stefani "

I broke up with my boyfriend on June 29 (the last time I had intercourse), and a day or two later about two days spotting, just consistent light barely-there bleeding, which I have literally never experienced before in my life, on the pill or off of it. I panicked and took a pregnancy test on July 2nd, which was negative. I thought I was free and clear, I stopped taking the mini-pill on July 3rd (mid-pack, which I know is bad... ) and haven't had sex since then. I still thought the spotting was weird, and my friend says since the spotting occurred about a day after the last time I had sex, it could have been implementation blood. I don't know super well how BC works -- could I be pregnant? Should I take another test? "

Side effects are fatigue, insomnia, feeling jittery?","I’m new to this whole world of, well all of this. I had my first “anxiety attack” beginning of January, went to ER as I didn’t know what was going on. Ran tests, sent me home with a couple days worth of Ativan. The rest of that week, it was like a flip was switched and suddenly I was completely unable to control anxiety. I was a mess. Appetite completely gone, lost 10 lbs in a matter of days, couldn’t get out of bed, couldn’t work... just all of a sudden. I went to my doctor a week later and he started me on 10mg Lexapro and 1mg Ativan as needed. It’s been almost 3 weeks, and in the beginning I had a hell of a time with side effects. Pretty much had all of them. Now at nearly 3 weeks, some things have improved as far as appetite is back, anxiety is better though still there (I still take at least 0.5 Ativan a day), I have periods of the day I feel “normal” but it’s brief. The side effects I’m still dealing with are diarrhea (for the entire month of January, this has been my life) and trouble sleeping at night, and being very tired during most of the day. I seem to get some energy late evening finally, but that energy often feels like over-caffeinated or something. Jittery, restless, fidgety and I am not a fan of how that feels. I’ve experimented taking my pills at different times of day but it doesn’t seem to make a difference. Will these side effects go away ever?

I know if I take it before bed, I’ll be able to at least get some sleep and hopefully fall back into my normal sleep cycle. How do I safely start taking it around 9 or 10 PM instead of at noon?

Have taken Ativan at varying dosages for over 10 years. New Dr. reduced Ativan from 4mg to 1mg per day. I'm having a terrible time with it.  Having crisis with elderly parents. I am only child with no relatives to help. Have all the state help they qualify for but in the end they are my responsibility. I can't make decisions, am extremely nervous, ignoring my friends, everything seems distorted, and generally not coping well.  I am on Medicaid. I ask for a new Dr. but there is not one available. Actually this one probably isn't going to refill the 1 mg a day. I was put on it for PTSD and severe anxiety. I know it is important to get off of it but think this has been too fast and caused unnecessary problems. I am on my own with this.   Please don't suggest new Dr. as State run programs have very limited resources and are losing what they have .  Actually I did see a replacement Dr one time (she was quitting so only saw her the one time). She said she doesn't prescribe Ativan at all. So I may be really going from 4 mg to 0mg.

My Dad has dementia from many strokes and TIA's and my 88 yr old mother has Alzheimer's so I know I have a good chance of getting it but I am horrified and feel life over if I have it so young. I think it is long term depression, rx use; anti-depressants,Lyrica for fibromyalgia,pain killers, head trauma from 9 yrs of abuse by ex-husband, long-term unrelenting stress, migraines, and intractable insomnia. But if I am dx'd with dementia that will be forever in my record and I will be so embarrassed I will withdraw from everything even more.  I know I'm rambling. Immediate question is how to deal with sudden reduction in Ativan. It has been about 2 months already but still feel like I'm in hell. Would really appreciate any help and experience you have. "

No drugs seem to work?,"So I am a 21 year old woman and I have had chronic severe pain mainly in my bones (forearms, shoulders, hands, fingers, back, neck, legs) for the past two years. I first discovered the symptoms as restless legs and what seemed to be body aches. I later found out after spending the night at a sleep center that I had had restless legs. However, despite the insomnia at the time, nothing was as bad as it is now. I now believe that I have fibromyalgia. My primary care physician has diagnosed me but hasn't checked out the pressure points associated with fibro yet. So it may be something entirely different. Now I'm on a slew of meds so bear with me. Cymbalta 120mg (for depression anxiety and fibromyalgia (still in question) Clonopin 1mg (anxiety) Cyclobenzabrine 10mg (pain) Pramipexole 0.25mg (restless legs) Naproxen 500mg (pain) Metoprolol ER Succinate 50 mg tabs (blood pressure) Hydrochlorothiazide (12.5mg x2 a day, water pill) Amlodapine/Benazapril 10/40 mg (blood pressure) Omeperazole 40 mg (acid reflux) Tri Nessa 28's (birth control)  The cymbalta helps a bit but if i accidentally skip a dose I feel it the next day and the pain in my bones and everywhere is so painful I can't stop crying so i take naproxen, advil, and tylenol, and it only goes from a 9 to a 6 in the pain scale. I've had Norco 5/325 and so far those are the only things that work to get rid of the pain. Because even with cymbalta, I get horrendous flare ups all over and it's just so unbearable.  I've been on zolpidem er 12.5 mg (for insomnia) and also gabapentin 300 x3 times a day. Both did nothing. Plus, with all of the medications I'm on to help dull the pain, I am never NOT sleepy or tired. I can never wake up fully regardless on the duration or quality of sleep. I'm never fully awake. I'm always sedated and in pain.  I don't know if it's fibromyalgia. But it's something. I got tested negative for some kind of rheumatoid arthritis factor so they think its nerve pain. (doctors) But if it was, then I would be feeling better, correct? I feel like this isn't the best idea but norco has only been the one who has worked for me and I don't know what else to do . "

Insomnia,https://www.drugs.com/answers/ativan-withdrawal-277078.html,Ativan withdrawal - how do I quit?,"Okay, I'll try and sum this up as best I can without writing a novel.  I've been going through mental issues (anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder) for about seven years. The severity has changed throughout the years; it was the worst when I was fourteen and fifteen and is back to being that bad now.  I was prescribed Ativan about six months ago or more after going to the emergency room when having a panic attack and they gave me that. I had been taking Klonopin for a while before that and stopped, but found that I liked Ativan because it was fast-acting and at the time I didn't feel as though I needed a long-term medication. About two months ago, I went in again to the emergency room and they gave me two Ativan rather than one. I then went to my doctor and told him I started taking two, so he upped my dose to two every time I had a panic attack. Well, as the panic attacks began to happen more often every day and the severity of them increased over the past few weeks, I've been going way overboard on my use of the stuff. I typically take five a day, spread out so as to maintain a calmness. I can function mostly fine on them, although I am slightly drowsy and sometimes my vision isn't perfect. This is also to help me be tired enough to sleep because I have very severe insomnia and my tolerance to any medication that makes me tired is almost unheard of.  I did try yesterday to go off of the Ativan because I know that taking this many a day isn't a good idea and I'll be seeing my doctor on the 6th to discuss all that's been happening and whatnot (he knows how many I've been taking a day because I talked to his nurse, but we need to figure out what to tweak my meds to from here) and felt very ill: nausea, hand tremors, sweating, headache. I ended up taking three throughout the day to keep the problems away. The same goes for today. My questions for you are these: - Is it right to quit completely based on the dose I've been taking every day? - What are the long term effects of how much I've been taking? - Are these 'withdrawal' problems I've been having real, or a figment of my imagination? - Any further advice or information on this would be very much appreciated.  Thank you! :] "

From what I've been able to gather, I seem to be at an early stage - my worst pain is in my hands - a varying dull ache punctuated by sharp or burning pain in the knuckles (typing this was a rough undertaking). Otherwise, my pains jump around, hitting my hips, right knee and elbows - although, now that I mention it, my knee and hips feel okay right now. Sitting for too long (+/- an hour) makes me very stiff, and it can sometimes be difficult to rise, but once I get moving, I can usually walk it off. I've only had my Primary and one Specialist opine on my state, and have yet to get a consult with my Dermatologist - he's a roadshow, and only in town once a month. As to meds, the NSAIDs I'm on don't seem to help my hands at all, even though this is the 3rd different type and dosage. I have xrays of my hands, hips and lower back pending, and I'm due to revisit my Specialist in 6 months -- but if things go as it appears they may, that schedule may need to change!

Panic Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/lexapro-severe-side-effects-3220578.html,Lexapro severe side effects...now what?,"I have been dealing with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and a panic disorder for about two years, although I've had issues with anxiety and panic attacks for about 7+ years. I was prescribed Lexapro (escitalopram) recently, and was told by my practitioner that there would most likely be no side effects, and to start off on 10 mg; I was given no further instructions on when and how to take it. Because I thought there would be no side effects, I took my first dosage right before bed on a weeknight - and what a mistake! About 2-3 hours later, I woke up to a pounding, racing heart and my body temperature fluctuating, my head, chest and stomach were tingling; shaking and sweating, headache, and was not able to sleep at all for the next 24 hours (insomnia + mild mania?). The next morning I was still trembling and weak, had to call off work, and had flashes of light in my vision, in addition to loose bowels... I was running to the bathroom every 20 minutes. It was as if I was on speed, or had way too much caffeine. I called my doctor the next day and she didn't seem too concerned, just said to take 5 mg instead and in the morning. So I took a break from it that day, and the next day took a quarter of a pill (2.5 mg) in the morning. I went to work, and within a few hours had similar (although less severe) sensations... brain tingling, sweating, heart racing, couldn't focus on anything, had difficulty maintaining a conversation. Once those effects went away, I felt fine for the rest of the day, but that night I broke out in hives. I have not taken anymore Lexapro since that 2.5 mg dose a couple of days ago, but today my heartbeat has been beating erratically (or at least it feels like it) and I've still been getting tingly headaches and more frequent panic attacks. I also broke out in hives again today, and a little while after the hives, my throat felt tight and I had bad chest pain. I don't want to take the drug ever again, but I also don't want to deal with my ""normal"" anxiety forever. I once took Zoloft as a teenager, about 5 years ago, and remember a similar reaction where it was as if I had several shots of 5-hour energy. I don't want to be on drugs with such nasty side effects, and that can cause a dependence or withdrawal symptoms, but I don't know what else to do for my condition. SSRI's just don't seem to be an option for me. Has anyone had a similar experience with Lexapro or other antidepressants? When will the chest pain/heart palpitations wear off? I didn't take the drug today and I am still having these effects. I haven't had heart palpitations like this in years. What should I tell my doctor? Thank you so much, my doctor's appointment isn't for another week and a half and I'm concerned about my reaction to Lexapro, and the heart symptoms I'm still having.

Panic Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/xanaxs-make-clean-organized-main-reasons-745554.html,Why do Xanax's make me clean and get organized? These are the main reasons as to why I take them?,"I have noticed that when I take my Xanax, I clean, get organized, able to make phone calls, and get so much accomplished throughout the day. If I don't have any Xanax, It takes everything in me to clean, do the laundry, etc. I imagine this is from maybe a chemical imbalance in my brain. I only know of one other person who cleans on them, as well. Other than her, do you know if Xanax has this effect on others? I don't care for the short-term memory loss that is a side-effect with this med. Is there any other medication (I have not found any other medicine yet that has this same effect for me) or herbal remedy or over the counter med that may have the same effect for me so I don't have to rely on the Xanax to make me do ""everyday chores""? I talked to my therapist about this. She suggested that perhaps, with my anxiety, without the med, I am too overwhelmed to know where to begin, so I don't. But, I have taken Valium and it just relaxes me and doesn't give me that desire to clean my house, make appointments, send out job app's, etc. I have a husband who doesn't understand how the Xanax would make me so organized. He feels I should do this automatically. Needless to say, it's a touchy subject. Because it's a constant battle to get me to ""functional"" when I am out of my medicines. Any suggestions or advice would greatly be appreciated. Thanks in advance. Also, I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder which I am prescribed Wellbutrin. PS. I had to take a Xanax to write this question and have noticed my heart is racing as I type. If I had not taken a Xanax, I wouldn't even had considered coming to this site, let alone, asking my first question. Thanks again. "

It will be one in the morning then many hours later one at work then many hours later one at night to help me drive home and go to sleep. I don't feel like I am abusing my prescription since my anxiety is off the charts and this medicine really does help me through out the day. It's almost been a week and out of the 30 pills I got Monday I have about 15 left. I'm not concerned about it since I have one refill before I see my doctor in one month. My question is, if I tell my doctor that I take about 3-4 pills every day will she think I am abusing it? I don't use my medicine to get high, I don't take 2 or 3 at once. I feel that I am being responsible with it, making sure that it's been at least 4-5 hours before taking another dose. I'm afraid that, if I get a refill before my appointment it will look bad. I don't want my doctor to think I am abusing my medicine. I also want to ask her if it is possible to up my dosage from 0.25mg to .5mg. How would I go about that? What things should I say? I'm starting to notice that I need more of my medicine to do the job when one was doing the job. I want to be honest with my doctor, I do NOT want to be off of Xanax, I don't know what I would do, I think I would have a nervous break down and my anxiety attacks would be much more frequent and harsh. Help? "
Panic Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/withdrawal-symptoms-start-after-stopping-lexapro-3375055.html,When do withdrawal symptoms start after stopping Lexapro?,I took Lexapro for 5 weeks for anxiety/panic disorder and due to side effects constantly going even after 4 weeks i told my psychiatrist and she agreed and told me to ween off it for the next 4 days only taking half the pill. Made me feel more at ease the last day i felt good that i took it and felt great after not taking it. i had a few anxiety moments coming and going but not extreme like heart palpitations or shortness of breath or a panic attack.

I don't speak english fluently so please don't judge me about that :) Before taking this medication, i had little to no motivation and i was always seeing horrific images of myself (including self injured parts of myself). I never had violents acts on myself, but was taking drugs all day (codeine) to calm down my body. I stopped codeine for a while (maybe my only motivation moment !) and never came down again. After about 5 months (maybe more) i decided to go to the GP to talk about my problems but it was so hard to explain ! My body was shaking all day, i had bad dreams which induce me to wake up very sad, and this feeling last all day long (accompanied with all those nigthmares visions... ).   After many visits to the GP, she prescribed me mirtazapine 15mg ten days ago (i started it immediatly). it gaves me a good sleep (thanks god i really need it !), but i have to wait hours to wake up ! My dreams are now really strong and clear, but not like before. They are kinda nice and apreciable (even if they are nightmares they are clearly better than before !). But now i have really no motivation. Can't do anything all day long by myslef, just waiting the night to get rest. By chance it's holydays here (i'm a french student), but i can't do my homeworks, can't do anything... just waiting on sofa or bed...  So my question is : will i be able to find any motivation with mirtazapine ? i know it's been only 10 days i started this pill, and it needs much more time to be really effective. But i'm on the end of the school year and i really need to work hard, really hard... I don't want to stop this pill cause know i have good sleep, no seizure and no horrific images in my head, but i feel like a zombie...  Is there anyone who have experienced this ?

So if I have been taking the wellbutrin 100mg 2x a day as of about 5-6 days and yesterday I took 3 and have only taken 2 today, is it safe to not take the 3rd today, then do 2 more days of 2 pills, then 2 days of 1 pill, then 2 days of 1/2 pill, then stop? How can I stop? I'm afraid of the seizures and I think the depression is more related to being home sick (cross-country move) and use of something called kratom which I am stopping taking and has it's W/Ds. So, can someone help with the wellbutrin taper given my usage of it to date: 4-5 days: 2x 100mg @ 12 hrs apart yesterday: 3x 100mg @ 7 hr intervals today: 2x so far (8am and 3pm) Thanks in advance!

Insomnia,https://www.drugs.com/answers/experience-dalmane-2288135.html,Experience with Dalmane?,"I have a long history with my psychiatrist of different sleep meds. I have depression & anxiety (being treated). My mood & energy is already really low in the morning/all day. Medications like Ambien, Lunesta, etc. make me so drowsy & give me a hung over feeling the next day. These meds have all only helped with sleep initiation, but not maintaining sleep too. I wake up all thru the night & also eat a lot without being fully awake.  I've tried Restoril, remeron, trazadone, Abilify (completely lost the ability to function), seroquel, klonopin, Chloral Hydrate & many others. Clonidine which is used off label for ADHD & sleep has been the only Rx with some success. I have low blood pressure tho, and it made my bp dangerously low so my doctor took me off it. I've been taking Xanax for years & I'm too tolerant now for it to help me with sleep.  I was recently prescribed Dalmane (I can fill after the weekend). She mentioned she has only ever put 1 other patient on it before. She has been in the field for a really long time so that makes me slightly nervous. I read Dalmane shouldn't be taken by elderly people, because there are safer medications of it's kind. Is Dalmane stronger or more dangerous than other ones in it's class? I'm also somewhat nervous that it remaibs in your system 3-4 days, because if it builds & is supposed to work better after taking it for a few days - Won't it increase the likelihood that I'll feel very tired the next morning & day? I can't handle feeling more lethargic than I already do.  I'd like to hear other people's experiences with Dalmane. If it's any more dangerous than Ambien or similiar medications? If it made you too tired to function the next day? Overall opinions about it (I know everyone reacts differently & still want a general idea). I'm not really looking for recommendations about other sleeping medications to try. Just experiences & knowledge for Dalmane. I'm not sure if it's a medicine that affects people differently based on size/gender. If so - I'm 24 years old & female. 5'4"" & 100 lbs.

So I went off of it and struggled with insomnia for three months. The lack of sleep made me start up on it again for the past two months, but I have been able to taper down from 10 mg to 5 mg over the past three weeks.

I don’t want to take them both at the same time because I take a benzodiazepine for anxiety during the day and I don’t want to risk taking too many sedating medications.  Should I try using trazodone just a few nights per week and then gradually cut the Ambien out? Or take Ambien one night and Trazodone the next?

Insomnia,https://www.drugs.com/answers/adverse-effects-switching-amitriptyline-3445908.html,Any adverse effects switching from amitriptyline to nortriptyline (after withdrawal)?,"I was on 10 mg amitriptyline for 3 months for headaches and insomnia. I tolerated this dose well with some dry mouth and grogginess upon waking. After 3 months I decided to taper down, with the approval of my neurologist. I tapered to 5 mg (using a pill splitter) for 1 month and then 2.5 mg... but promptly began experiencing major withdrawal symptoms. I had 10/10 headache that sent me to the ER, as well as high levels of fear, panic, and anxiety which are completely abnormal for me. Correlated to this was also diarrhea, rapid heart rate, and trouble urinating. We connected all this to withdrawal and I went back up to 10 mg, with symptoms steadily improving. Note that Ami has delayed withdrawal symptoms. More recently, my progress seems to have stalled and somewhat declined. I am again experiencing rapid heart rate and headache, but the emotional symptoms are not as pronounced.  The doc has suggested that I switch to Nortriptyline as perhaps it can be more effective for me. I would like to know if anyone has had experience switching from Amitrip to Nortrip and if you noted any adverse effects with the switch? I am hesitant to change things. I do not want to go through withdrawal all over again.  Also, has anyone gone through Amitrip withdrawal and what was your experience like/what did you do to stabilize and then taper effectively later on? "

Found you desperately searching for help. I have been on xanax for 20 years. Started at .25mg twice a day and worked up to 4 mg a day for anxiety and panic disorder. Well I have been at 4 mg for 5 years and little did I know, or never was told that I would hit a tolerance, and wow wee. I am having horrible tolerance w/d. So I went to dr. and they switched me to 4mg xanax xr. I quit xanax IR cold turkey and just took 3mg of xr in the morning and 1mg xr at bedtime. This is not working well at all for me.

It has put me into severe w/d so bad I am pleading with my husband to let me end this nightmare. NO ONE should have to live like this. So i decided, until I can get to my dr on thursday, that I am taking the xr with like .5 mg reg xanax to remain comfortable and sane. I have been in the xr for a week. 20 years of this and no one ever told me I would end up in this position.

The regular xanax used to give me like 6 hours relief, now its like and hour or two, after 20 years. And to come off this stuff is barbaric. I am just looking for some input on switching to the xr, if it will get better, and do people still need the reg xanax sometimes or will the xr eventualy be enough. i am so sad, and confused, and a mother of 5, that if it wasnt for them, I would be out of here.

I've had it longer than that and when I was younger I had Panic disorder but up until 2 and 1\2 years ago it was in control. (The panic disorder has mostly dissipated) I took myself off of zoloft for some reason that I don't even understand and it just turned my world upside down. Major anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, and so on. Finally in september of last year a doctor put me back on some medications that seemed to allow me to at least function. That was effexor, the risperdal and prozac were added later. I am on .25 mg of risperdal, 75 mg of effexor, and I was on 20 mg of prozac. The fact is, is that I could function, but I was nowhere near myself, I'm still not myself. Back when I was on just zoloft I was really really energetic. I was constantly out and about. With friends, going to public events. Now, even on these medications, I am very sluggish, in an almost depressed sort of way. I avoid friends and social situations and if I am in a social situation it is very anxiety provoking. At home I have lost all motivation, I don't clean, I don't have fun, I spend most of my days sitting around feeling anxiety. I'm still in high school and I started out this year strong, nearly straight A's and now I'm barely passing my classes. I'm a senior, I can't afford to fail. I also have bizarre things that I've never had before, the biggest one is night sweats. It used to be just when I forgot a medication, but now it's every time I dream about anything I sweat profusely. So much so you can see it on the sheets. I finally demanded that my doctor put me back on zoloft, so she finally put me on 100 mg of zoloft and took me off of the prozac and left the other two medications alone. I haven't taken it for a full week yet and I'm supposed to be taking 50 mg until then and then go up to the full hundered.. seems like a bit much to me but I don't know. I hope this is going to help, but I have a feeling it won't. Any Idea on what is causing this major struggle? I want my energy back!!! I want to be me again, I want to want to hang out with people again, and go to public events. I want to have motivation. Is there something with these medications that could be causing this?

Panic Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/increased-vivid-nightmares-lexapro-stop-taking-3459270.html,Increased vivid nightmares on Lexapro — should I stop taking it?,"I have been on Lexapro (5mg) for I believe 11 or 12 days now for anxiety and depression. I was previously on Zoloft for only 10 days and my psychiatrist had me switch due to some nasty side effects (I actually posted a question on here about that at the time too). Anyway, I’m on the Lexapro now and I have certainly experienced less side effects overall which is nice but one thing that has continued are these crazy vivid nightmares which cause serious morning anxiety. I have suffered from nightmares my whole life (I am 22) so to a certain degree I’m used to it but the SSRIs have just kicked the intensity up to a level that is seriously disturbing me and giving me major problems in my waking life. I’ll have several nightmares a night, all of which I remember in excruciating detail. I’ve had nightmares that feel so real the emotional impact sticks with me for 1-3 days after and feels like a real memory. I’m not trying to be dramatic but sometimes I feel like people who don’t experience this type of thing have a difficult time understanding the impact having nightmares like this can have on one’s ability to function normally—so I’m just trying to paint a clear picture. Anyway, my question is this: has anybody had similar side effects, and eventually experienced relief from them? I’ve read mixed things online, and I’m worried that since this is a problem I had already it isn’t going to go away if I stick with the SSRI and that it may in fact just continue making it worse. I have a sister who took Lexapro for 8 months and it gave her nightmares as well. I don’t know, I’m just very frustrated I guess. Could it be that medication just isn’t the right option for me? I don’t meet with my psychiatrist again for about three weeks and if this problem persists, I’m just dreading the idea of having to try ANOTHER medication and start all over with side effects and blah blah blah...

Insomnia,https://www.drugs.com/answers/cherry-juice-for-insomnia-358464.html,Cherry juice! For insomnia?,"I originally posted this as a comment but decided to ask the question on it's own merit. I am also going to post this in the methadone/chronic pain forumn also. Where can someone find cherry juice? I go from excessive sleepiness sometimes sleeping 20 hours a day for a few days & then I have insomnia for 2 or 3 days! This back & forth just makes my pain worse & I always feel exhausted! I was approved Nuvigil yesterday. So it will help the days that I sleep all day but could make the insomnia worse. My pain & insomnia has gotten worse since I tapered down & went off methadone & started taking oxycodone again. The oxycodone is not controlling my pain. The only reason I went off the methadone was because of the stigma of the drug. I went to Cleveland Clinic to digestion issues & all they would focus on was the methadone & xanax (the xanax used to help me go to sleep but not anymore) I went through all the traditional sleep meds but they all left me ""hung over"". I also have complex sleep apnea & I have a round face so I spend half the night adjusting my mask. I am open for all suggestions on insomnia natural remedies because when I go on the Nuvigil, I'm sure my doc will not give me anything for sleep. My doc wanted to prescribe Provigil since it was not extended release & I could control more effectively when to take it so it would not interfere with my sleep. However the insurance knows more than the doctor & wouldn't approve it! I take the Nuvigil at 7:00 am but since it is extended release stays in my system too long. This could be because of the medicine to treat ulcers & too much bile from my liver being released in my stomach. The carafate coats my stomach & could change the release of the drug in my system. I have tried melatonin with very little results. I would like to hear about natural treatments for my bouts of insomnia & opinions of me going back on the methadone. I didn't have any problems going off the drug but my max dose was 25 mg a day. "

Last night I took one 10mg dose of the generic Lexapro (Escaphram, I think?) Within 20 minutes my heart started racing and skipping beats. I got VERY anxious and had a full blown panic attack. It was so bad that I literally didn't sleep last night, and my wife had to constantly calm me down throughout the night because I legit thought I was dying. I kept shaking and trembling, heart was pounding, racing thoughts...  I ended up seeing my doc today who basically told me nothing was wrong, did an EKG, all that good stuff. Everything came back normal. Also, I'm wearing a Wevent cardio monitor for 30 days, so I'm assuming if something was really wrong, I'd get some type of notification.  Anyway, the panic symptoms have sort of subsided, but now I keep getting these weird waves of tingles all through my body. Makes it very hard to concentrate since it's been constant for about 5 hours now. I'm pretty miserable at the moment. The doc gave me a prescription for a beta blocker to stop my heart from racing and to replace my prescription of 10mg of lisinopril (which also gave me a racing heart). Anyone know how long this will last on just one dose? Hoping to be better by Monday since I start a new job. "

I have been on the Pristiq for 5 weeks now and am wondering if the headaches are from the Pristiq or the Lexapro withdrawal. I am also having regular panic attacks but they don't seem to be as powerful but that may be because he gave me 0.5 mg of Klonopin to use as needed.

I am suffering from a dark depression, due to both mid life crisis plus lack of purpose in career etc. I was originally put on Lexapro - zombied me ... then Valdoxin ... did great for my sleep yet backed off on the depression assistance ... and now Zoloft ... was good for the first two weeks of overlap with the Valdoxin taper (although Valdoxin does not need much taper) and just the last few days my anxiety has been through the roof. I must say though that a week earlier I had two or three moments of what I call""clarity"" - where I just felt at peace and my old self again ... for half a day or so each time.

I had my first panic attack 2 weeks after she passed.. n have had many since.. my panic attacks are much better these days I bearly have them.. for 4 yrs I was so scared to take a anxiety med because of fear of side effects.. I've never been on meds before this. I was 32 when this all started and am 37 now.. any woo.. about 3 mos ago I was cutting a tomato with a knife n had a thought of what if I hurt myself with it... omg that scared me so much I started having terrible anxiety was terrified to be home alone ... over the weeks it went from me having thoughts of hurting myself... I am not suicidal... to thoughts of hurting my kids... which id never do.. n I was scared to be left alone with them... to even thoughts of hurting my mother when I was alone with her .. again id never do something like this ... it has scared me so much i told my husband to take me to the mental hosp... which he didn't.. he says he knows me better then that n id never hurt anybody... it has been a daily struggle for me.. well I talked to my doc about it n she put me on .5mg of clonazepam twice a day... because of my fear of meds I only took half of that so .25mg once a day for weeks... n it help a lot with the anxiety.. now I been taking the whole pill so .5mg just at night and it's helped during the day for my anxiety .. sometimes I have to take a half .25mg during the day because usually around my period my anxiety and depression are really bad... my question is.. can clonazepam make you feel depressed?

I just don't know what to do.. I'm feeling depressed often.. anxiety comes here n there even on the .5mg of clonazepam.. my kids r worried about me because I cry alot.. my husband has pretty much gave up on helping me n just leaves me to my own devices n bearly talks to me ... because I think he's sick of it.. how do I feel happy again with no anxiety n no depression?

Information: general anxiety with agoraphobia- for that I'm not prescribed anything as I insisted to steer clear off any benzodiazepines or sedatives, I deal with anxiety with breathing techniques and healthy distractions. No problems. PTSD- for that I'm prescribed trazodone, for sleep. But I'm taking it only if I have flashbacks at night. I am prescribed 10mg diazepam, 3 times a day. I was prescribed this when I was in treatment for alcohol withdrawal. In my opinion, I shouldn't use diazepam if I don't experience cravings for alcohol. I'm not taking it everyday. Not even once a week. Today I am anxious, and it progressed throught the day. I tried reaching out to a few friends but today wasn't so successful. I was depending on sorting this out by talking and I guess because i felt as if ""my time runs out"" my anxiety got worse.  I decided this anxiety is already a SOS situation, I thought taking one 10mg diazepam will be more then enough to prevent an anxiety attack or a flashback. It's been around 2 hours since i took it, and my anxiety just gets worse and I'm panicking a bit. What can I do to calm down, besides taking a sleeping pill to run away from the problem? Should I drink camomile tea? Was the diazepam a mistake? I have Klonopin as well (a year ago, doctors in the ER gave me a package of 0.5mg, and advised me to take it for panic attacks.) I never used it, but if its for panic attacks, can it help? But I'm scared 0.5 Klonopin+10 diazepam is unhealthy. Or too much.

I do suffer from panic attacks and it has gotten a bit worse, but overall, my day to day life is fairly normal. I expressed to her that I did not like how I felt on Zoloft, after having taken it previously. I also expressed concerns about Xanax because of a close family member abusing it a few years ago. She was pretty rude, honestly, but at the end of it all prescribed Lexapro for daily use and Xanax as needed. Upon getting home, I started reading the side effects of Lexapro and I'm not entirely sure I want to take it. Side effects like lowered sex drive are a concern to me as a married woman and I do enjoy the occasional glass of red wine. The psychiatrist made me cry because she was rude (I'm super sensitive) and I'm a little nervous about not filling the prescription. As a example of her rudeness, when I told her about my concern regarding family drug abuse and Xanax, her response was, ""You're acting pretty dramatic and it should not have affected you that much. Drug abuse is very common. Your situation is not unique."" Um, okay...    I have a follow up with her in February to track my progress. I'm disappointed that the solution was to give me this two drugs -- one that she knew I adverse to taking from the start-- without considering the overall effects it would have.

I am 23 years old and in the last 4 months, my GAD has turned from moderate to SEVERE GAD that has flipped my life completely upside down. 3 months before I ultimately had my ""breakdown"", which involved 10 trips to the ER because my anxiety centers on health anxiety, I stopped taking my Wellbutrin. I had slowly tapered myself off because, working in the health care field, I unfortunately knew how to properly do it, and thought I was well enough too... while tapering off I felt fine, and it was only 3 months after this that I lost my mind - I assume this happened because of being on no medicine. I took 300 mg of Wellbutrin for at least 1.5 years and my anxiety was still there, but not debilitating - to be honest, I only really would get mild anxiety about my relationship, thinking my boyfriend was not attracted to me, and obsessing over the amount of sex we have. But otherwise, my anxiety was mainly controlled. My assumption is that it did indeed work for me, but it's hard to say. I took Cipralex prior to Wellbutrin for several years with some success, but had some scary meltdowns on it and too many sexual side effects... which is when I decided to give Wellbutrin a try. My question for whoever replies to this is: did anybody get relief from GAD/anxiety from taking Wellbutrin? Please do not reply incredibly negative things, as I get scared from seeing the bad responses and convince myself it is then going to happen to me. Since my major breakdown in December, I have been on 150 mg of Wellbutrin and 10 mg of Buspar a day - I have definitely improved but still having major, debilitating problems. I'm not sure which drug is helping me, but I don't want to take the Buspar because apparently heart attacks are a risk with it. I only want to take the Wellbutrin, so I'm hoping to hear from some people hear who've had success with it smile PS: would you assume I went off the deep end from stopping the WB? I assume that's what happened but am worried it would have happened anyway... yet again, worrying!!! Also, I tried Cipralex again in December but ultimately thought I was going manic... the SSRI's seem to cause severe issues with me (increased anxiety, bad thoughts, etc) and I am terrified to try any of them again. I'm not sure why they used to work before, but don't anymore. I'm scared of this happening if I increase my Wellbutrin dosage, which is what my GP has suggested I do. Anyways, thanks in advance for any advice or experiences you may have :) and please no horrible stories about seizures/manic episodes because I mentally cannot handle hearing any more overly negative things!

Panic Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/250-mg-of-zoloft-183327.html,250 MG. of Zoloft?,"My sister has had a ""breakdown"" she says. Has left work angry at someone or some incident, practically screaming, crying and very upset a few times in the last couple of months. She says EVERYTHING upsets her now, even TALKING to ME. She has been on 100 mg. of Zoloft for about 6 years now, but her new HMO Psychiatrist has increased the dosage quite a bit, to 250 MG.  We used to have a good relationship, but without any talking, I can't see how not working through or sharing problems will help it. Recently I had a very stressful event (police were involved) but have gotten over it (without talking to her). I did call her at first, which was before she told me ""I UPSET HER,"" but when I did, she said ""she can't get upset"" and felt she was feeling stressed and angry and hung up.  I think about her all the time and today is her birthday. She takes everything the doctors offer her. Cholesterol medicine, daily stomach acid RX, high blood pressure RX, and Excedrin every day. In the past I have wondered if she likes the attention she gets when she is ""sick"" Doctors are nice to her, of course! Or perhaps she is a hypochondriac?  Is this dosage dangerous? I am afraid of Serotonin Syndrome, which is very dangerous.  Her symptoms have developed over an extended time, actually since her Menopause. Initially she was on immediately put on ERT by one of these HMO docs, but when bad news came out, she was told to discontinue it by a different HMO doc. She has excess testosterone, (a slight beard) has had breast cysts, (As you can tell, I am not impressed with the care she gets -- and her company seems to change HMOs almost every year.)  She has had early stage melanoma (removed) and you name it -- a trigger finger operation and two carpal tunnel operations, but the carpal is coming back. I have it too, but I deal with it.  I mentioned new blood tests for the post-menopausal hormone levels and perhaps a CT scan for her pituitary. A possible problem such as ""steroid rage"" (I didn't use those words) could cause aggression and irritability, but she ignored me and says that her ""professional"" knows what is best.  Any opinions out there? She is 58 today. "

My main concern is that no medication on the market has seemed to work for me. I was initially diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder then Depression and finally ADHD. Currently I am seeing a new psych and am taking medications for Insomnia (Trazodone—50 mg); ADHD (Vyvanse—60mg) and Bipolar (Divalproex—500 mg twice). When i started off ADHD medications I had tried everything Concerta at 148 mg, Vyvanse at 60 mg, Adderall at 60 mg, Dexedrine at 30 mg and Ritalin at 10 mg—didnt really increase Ritalin. I have also mixed and matched medications like Vyvanse 60mg with 20 mg Adderall and nothing seemed to defeat my ADHD symptoms. That is I would still loose focus, take long to do my readings, be forgetful, feel tired throughout the whole day etc. For about a week I have been taking Divalproex and just yesterday I was prescribed 60 mg Vyvanse and 50 mg Trazodone. Forgot to mention that I have been on 40 mg Celexa and 30 mg of Rozerem.

Panic Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/panic-disorder-need-help-with-meds-advice-xanax-474273.html,"Panic Disorder - Need help with meds advice (Xanax, Klonopin). Is This normal?","I will try to be pretty brief with my details here but I'm pretty confused lately and would like some input from others.  I was seeing a psychiatrist most of last year for anxiety, panic, and depression, and I went through a slew of meds. I went through several SSRIs, none having a huge impact, but the benzos like Valium and Klonopin seemed to have the biggest relief for me, along with seeing a Ph.D psychotherapist. The first doctor had me on 1mg Klonopin twice a day, which just made me pretty sleepy, and the next doctor had me on 5mg Valium twice a day, which did next to nothing for my physical/panic symptoms.  I felt that the Klonopin lasted all day and calmed me enough to ever prevent panic episodes or the chest pains and such that would normally come about each day. I was involved in an auto accident and became dependent on pain medications, so I stopped all medications altogether, sought treatment, and just recently have began seeing a doctor again for my anxiety/panic issues. The psychiatrist office I am going to is scheduled far out, but I'm finally seeing the doctor in a few days, so in the meantime, I saw a family doctor here locally to help me until I can see the psychiatrist. She decided to put me on Lexapro 10mg and gave me twenty 0.5mg Xanax, instructed me to only take one per day, IF needed. That's fine, but I have never been prescribed Xanax before and it's almost causing me more issues than it's helping. After I took it the first 3-5 times, one pill would noticeably kill my anxiety/panic and allow me to go about my day... however it only lasts for maybe 3-4 hours at the most, and when it wears off, I have worse anxiety almost, which makes me feel I need to take another, but I quickly realized taking this 3-4 times a day is just going to be a mess. She called me in a second bottle of twenty Xanax (same dosage) after those ran out, but after just 2-3 weeks of taking one a day, I'm already noticing that it takes more like 1-1.5mg to have the same benefit, and still only lasts a few hours. I don't know why she chose this one, but it sucks. What should I tell my psychiatrist when I see him in a few days? I'm assuming he will prescribe something similar as my doctors have in the past, but Xanax's short-lasting help is just not what I need, and I found much more help from Klonopin for example. Is this normal that after this few doses that it's no longer having an effect? I read of people who have been on the same dose of Xanax for years, and I just don't see how that's possible from my experience lately. Sorry for the long description but I wanted to be detailed so I can get proper responses, thanks for reading and helping! "

Major PAs three years ago, since then cyclical limited symptom attacks mostly. I had a bad week or so recently. Not super PAs but not pretty. A new doctor (mine retired) decided to give me Valium, 5mgs twice a day. I half jokingly said that he'd better renew my Alprazolam or I'd have a panic attack right in his office. He complied - although he may have done so anyway. I took a Valium in the morning, felt OK - but by the afternoon I had a bad reaction - anger. I wanted to throw things and strangle my dog. Of course, I didn't. After two days of this I cut down to half the 5mg pill in the morning, half at night. So late in the afternoon I only got half as angry. After awhile it wasn't so bad. The Alprazolam I take when needed, one every three days or so, when I'm feeling panicky. It seems to me that Valium is OK, I get less LSAs and take less Alprazolam.

I'd seen a few posts about how it's recommended you should go from 3mg to 6mg THEN to 10mg, but there have been some nights recently I've had to double up the 3mg tablets to get good sleep so that counts as moving to 6mg right? Either way, now I'm wondering if this increase could have adverse effects. I know it won't kill me or anything but what should I expect with the increase in dosage? Will the 10mg tablets make me go to sleep faster/harder? Should I try taking it earlier than I did with the 3mg so I don't sleep in too much? Any help/advice is appreciated! "

I was only taking xanax at night before bed but as time went on my anxiety and panic attacks had gotten worse. When I was first prescribed pristiq my DR told me to take the xanax 3 times a day, I told him I didn't want to take it 3 times a day because i am afraid of taking of taking any pills. I went back to the DR. about a month into taking pristiq explaining my issues of increased anxiety. I agreed to start taking the xanax 3 times a day at first .5 mg in the am, .5 at noon and 1 mg at bed. I was fine for a few weeks and then I had a major breakdown after I got out of work. I called my Dr and he told me to take 1mg in the am,1mg mid day and the full 2 mg at bed. Is there anyone else out there that is on this combination? I am seeing a therapist to help me as well. Any advise would be great.  I am completely honest with my Dr. I tell him that I drink a glass of wine at night or a joint he has not issue with this. Again I am on the meds for anxiety not depression. I have never taken more xanax than prescribed. Honesty is the best policy in my opinion.   So far the pristiq has been hard to get used to, many side effects. The xanax helps with the side ecffects. I really have no one to talk to. My fiance has never had panic attacks or anxiety so talking to him is hard. I just switched therapists due to my other therapist retiring... wish me luck. Cheers! Anthony J "

I also take SSRIs for anxiety (Buspirone, bupropion), and blood pressure medication (Atenolol). As soon as I started taking Trazodone I started having even more trouble sleeping. The first night I had a deep sleep but awoke often during the night and felt incredibly groggy for the entire next day. The second night--last night--I barely slept at all. I tried to go to bed around midnight, but was up until after 6am. Because I'm a delivery driver, it's not safe for me to be working while sleep deprived to such a harsh degree. I could barely function at work the first day, and had to call in sick to work today because I would have been driving on less than 3 hours of sleep.

I was then prescribed Paxil along with the Ativan and the severe insomnia continued. When I close my eyes to sleep I feel hyperaroused and usually end up in a panic attack.

I had a DNA swab done and it shows Buspar in green indicating its a good fit for me metabolically.

Panic Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/second-week-zoloft-terrified-worsening-side-537800.html,Second week on Zoloft and I am terrified of worsening side effects?,"Just to give a slight background. Since 2006, I had been on Lexapro and it worked like a dream within a couple of weeks. I took it for a few years until I got pregnant and doctor advised me to wean off of it on my last trimester. I came of fine, had my baby and then the anxiety started a month to 2 months after that. I asked to be put on Zoloft because I was breastfeeding and they started me on 25mg. Well, I did ok but I never could take anymore than that because I was scared then too. So then, I developed other medical issues that prompted a surgery. Right after surgery, I asked the doc if I could switch to Lexapro. He said that it was fine and that since I was on such a small dose of Zoloft to quit that cold turkey and start Lexapro. Boy was he wrong. It was hell for about 2 weeks until Lexapro started working. Well, so I was on that since 2010 and then started gaining a lot of weight and my blood pressure was higher. By the end of 2011, I started having anxiety and panic attacks again related to food allergies. So then I went on a diet and started weaning myself from the Lexapro and was free from it during Christmas break. The withdrawal effects were not too bad but then here I am a few months later with signs of depression (that I never had this bad) and of course anxiety and panic. Asked the doc to put me on Zoloft because I didn't want start Lexapro and have to take a higher dose leading to more weight gain and higher blood pressure. So, here I am at day 6 of Zoloft. I felt ok for the first couple of days aside from some stomach issues that it gave me. Then here in the last couple of days, the anxiety is pretty bad. It was bad enough that I was sick this past weekend with laryngitis and of course I get to thinking that its worse than it really is and here comes the panic. I do have Xanax and I take a VERY small dose to calm me down. I take 1/4 tablet of it when I start panicking. Granted, I know that I can take more, I'm just absolutely afraid of getting addicted to it but it does work wonders. Especially now that I am back to work after being sick. Sorry for the long story. So here are my question. I am about to take my 50 mg dose of Zoloft tomorrow night. I would love to stay on 25mg but I know its a very low and not therapeutic. What can I expect? Will I still have worsening anxiety for a few days? Stomach issues? Nausea? I guess I kind of want to hear your experiences after upping the dose and how long before the anxiety calmed down. I hope to make some new friends out of this also. <3 "

Please help!?,"I'm 23 years old and have a concern about a medication I'm taking. First of all, I suffer from a severe and debilitating pain condition from an injury I had several years ago while weight lifting. It caused nerve and muscle damage which resulted in chronic pelvic pain.  Anyway, my doctor put me on Xanax 1 mg three times a day for my severe muscle spasms as well as anxiety that I get from my pain. I was on it for about three years. It didn't last long enough so I switched to Klonopin 1 mg three times a day.   The first month of being on Klonopin I was completely fine and doing better. It helped my spasms, it took away my pain, and helped my anxiety tremendously. It made me feel MUCH more stabilized and normal to where I could function. It caused no side effects either; not physical or mental.  However, it's month two being on Klonopin now and for some reason it's causing me to be irritable, aggressive, and short with other people. My family has noticed this and they're telling me how I'm being very difficult to be around.   Do you know why I was totally fine on the Klonopin the first month and IRRITABLE on it the second month? I find this to be very odd. I'm on the same dosage and same generic too. I haven't taken any other new medications or supplements either. Should I take less? Will this side effect go away over time? Is it because my body is in the process of getting used to it?  I'm very baffled as to why this is. I'd appreciate any information and advice on this! Thank you so much, Jay "

As a result, I woke up feeling disturbed and not normal.

Panic Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/lexapro-adhd-medication-quit-lexapro-3113890.html,"Lexapro and ADHD medication, how to quit lexapro while on them?","Hello, I am 19 years old about 5 foot 6 / 195 lbs. and have been taking lexapro for about five months 10mg in the evening. This is for panic disorder and general anxiety disorder and some depression. Then was diagnosed with ADHD two months later. I have been perscribed methylphenidate 5 mg for a month, then 18mg concerta for a month, and now have instead 20 mg of methylphenidate a day. Even before the methylphenidate I was experiencing symptoms of seratonin syndrome yet they weren't bad enough for me to honestly notice. A thing here or there. Now I've been noticing my lexapro is causing me to feel worse and worse each day and only recently when taking my morning dosage of Methylphenidate I discovered that I felt nauseous, sweaty, headache, confusion, fever, lack of focus and depressed mood even worse than before. Again this is not because of the methylphenidate I'm certain because I felt this way on lexapro before I started the methylphenidate, it is just exasperated by it now and is causing concern. How do I stop taking my lexapro safely and not endure this horrible issue anymore? Because it wasn't like I was horribly I'll but looking back it sure seems like hemorrhagic fever (exaggeration I'm sure) none the less it is horrible and I do not want the lexapro anymore. Any ideas other than contacting my psychiatrist? Heard this already just an odd hour. "
Panic Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/depression-anxiety-basically-citalopram-long-time-3111135.html,Depression and anxiety. Basically I've been on citalopram a long time and had a severe depression?,... so I upped my meds to 30mg. After seeing my dr at the time she wanted to go higher which I did but didn't tolerate well. Basically she yoyoed my dose 6 times in 8 weeks then I refused to budge at 35mg as my anxiety was through the the roof and became crippling.  I saw a psych who added in 12.5mg seroquel to my citalopram and lowered the cit to 30mg. Anxiety was still hell and I felt my thoughts got worse with the seroquel so I came off that two days ago. Had a bit of a sore head and dizziness but I feel less anxious and my thinking has definitely calmed down. Before this my dr wanted me to do a cross taper to venlafaxine xr which I'm not too keen on due to the drug profile. I'm wondering now whether escitalopram would be a better option since citalopram has worked so well for me for so long. Plus if I change from ssri to ssri they want me to taper off before starting another but I have heard you can swap from one to another without this? I was also wondering with all the ups and downs and now feeling a bit better on the one dose should I wait a bit longer to see how I feel? Could the citalopram be actually working and the terrible anxiety just be with all the ups and downs? I know no one here is a dr but I'd be really pleased to hear some opinions on what they think about my situation. It's been so chaotic I'm not sure what to do next if anything. Sorry this is so long but it's been 4 months of hell and I'd like to avoid any more if possible

Panic Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/diazepam-2mg-350546.html,Diazepam 2mg?,"Hi, Earlier this year I was prescribed 0.5mg clonazepam 30/month for breakthrough anxiety symptoms and panic attacks. I eventually had to switch from that doctor to a new one who switched me to Paxil as my anti-depressant. After a while, I started college in September and came into a huge load of stress and unmanageable anxiety. He put me on 1mg clonazepam twice a day for a month. Some things happened with my insurance company where I couldn't be covered to see that doctor anymore, so I stopped seeing a psychiatrist for a while, but kept taking my Paxil 30mg, obviously because of the withdrawal syndrome, plus it seems to be working decently for me.  But, I have once again come into a great deal of stress and anxiety lately and it has sparked an anxiety fire with me again, so I went to a more local doctor this time for some help. He told me to stay on the Paxil, but gave me a script for 2mg diazepam/valium. I did some research on the internet, and it looks like this is a ridiculously low dosage compared to the other benzodiazepines, especially compared to what I was taking before. I had forgotten that a 2mg diazepam pill even existed, actually. I found that 10mg diazepam is roughly equal to 0.5mg clonazepam, meaning that my 2mg diazepam tablet is worth a whopping 0.1mg of clonazepam. Really? Do you guys think this will actually help at all with my anxiety? I haven't been on a benzo for a couple months so I don't think I really have much of a tolerance. Do you think he is just starting me low because he wants to get me by with as little as possible, then he may raise my dose a bit? I took one of them today and I didn't really notice much. I couldn't tell if what I thought I ""felt"" was placebo or not. If it turns out to not be strong enough, what do I say? I don't want to tell him blatantly to give me a higher dose, because I'm afraid he might take it away, and I've had good luck with these drugs in the past so I want to keep it for when I need it. I'm thinking 5mg or 10mg would be more appropriate, but I don't know how to go about talking to my doc about it. Maybe I'll just wait until my next appointment and say something about possibly needing a dose increase, but I'm hoping you guys could help a bit on what I should say. Also, if anyone else is familiar with this dose, please let me know your experience with it and let me know if you think it will be of any use for me. Thanks a lot, Caleb "

Is this normal, is it true you may feel a lot worse before it gets better. How much time do I give it before deciding that it is not a proper fit for my body chemistry. I certainly do not want to wait 12 weeks to find out it is not going to help me. Is it true that Prozac takes a long time to work compared to other ssris. This is not my first time in taking an antidepressant but the trial and error method is just so frustrating for me. We take something to make us feel better, they actually make us sometimes feel worse and we have to push thru it just to see whether or not we have given it enough time then possibly switch and start the whole thing over again. It is such a vicous cycle and I know that I am not alone in feeling the frustration. I am not really interested in taking any quick acting anti anxiety meds to help me thru, I would rather lean on therapy that I am doing and some of the skills I have learned. I guess my real question is what is the general rule with Prozac in terms of if you haven't noticed real improvement by this amount of time then good chance it is not right for you.

Panic Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/longtime-sufferer-from-depression-anxiety-and-280918.html,"Longtime sufferer from Depression, Anxiety, and Panic attacks, need advice. 30 years old?","I am 30 years old. I had a depression problem my freshman year in highschool and remember thinking what is going on with me. For a short time I took Zoloft and I remember it helping. I remember my father telling me not to worry but it was simploy a chemical imbalance in my brain. During college in 1998, I had my first panic attack while going through fraternity rush and being asked questions during a pledge examination. I simply lost control of all my muscles and every muscle at that time contracted. In 1999 I my high school sweetheart broke my heart and started what was a pretty severe depression from 1999 - 2005. At the time I took no medicine but I would just read books about depression, especially about Abraham Lincoln called Lincon't Melacoly and remembering how much I related to his depression symptoms. At the time I just didn't want to be on any medication. Then, I meet a great women in 2005 and ,in 2005 after meeting my future wife, she gave me a ultimatim that I either get help in terms of counseling or we are through as I was having major anxiety problems relating to being able to commit to a relationship with her. (I would break up with her and would panic and then drive back the same night crying, did this two or three times.) Her request, that was the best advice of my life. After counseling and going to a M.D in 2005 I was prescribed 10 mg of Lexapro but shortly it was increased to 20 mg. That helped tremendously... consequently we got married and have been doing great, even had a baby girl in 2009. About 2.5 years later or in 2007 I was playing soccer and tore my knee (ACL, PCL, Menicus) After the surgery I was given strong doses of Oxycoden and Demoral for 3 weeks straight to help with the pain. My wife gave these to me per doctors dosage every 3-4 hours. Then after the 3 weeks and being out of medicine I stopped completely not thinking about any type of possible withdraws. The days following those three weeks were the hardest, most terrible days of my life. And I didn't want to think about putting any of that medicine back in my body again, it scared me too much. Suddenly I went to major Panic attacks, to the point of muscles contracting and not being able to simply function. At that time I tried to self-admit myself to a facility but was declined because they were full. After about 3-4 days of what I considering complete horror, I went to my F.P doctor and he prescribed by .25 mg of Xanix. That didn't help me and and he immediately up it to 1mg of Xanix. During those horrendous times I would take up to 3mg of Xanix and the panic feeling would go subside enough where I wouldn't feel like I was dying and could get some sleep. During that week or so I had zero appetitie and lost 15 pounds. This episode has stuck with me but I got through it. (One thing I know is I will never take Demoral or Oxycodon again in my life)  After getting over what I guess were withdraws, I did well. From 2007 - 2010 I stayed on 20mg of Lexapro and was doing fine with occasionally taking 1mg Xanix when a panic attack was coming and also occassionally taking 1mg for just higher anxiety and when flying. I would also occassionaly take 1mg when I couldn't sleep due to anxiety although before doing that I always try to put a ice pack around my forehead as that seems to calm my nerves somewhat. I have been doing the icepack about everynight for 6 months or so.  From 2005 - 2010 I went from 170 pounds to 200 pounds today and I have basically completely lost my sex drive. My wife is so beautiful and yet I am just never in the mood to make love. So, after our frustrations, I decided about 3 months ago to reduce my Lexapro from 20mg to 10 mg and now last month I have stopped taking Lexapro entirely. To this point I have done ""ok"" except with anxiety, now the only thing I have to rely on is the Xanix and I needed to take this while I was in a trip in Alaska almost every night last week to sleep and now that I am home I have had to take 1mg the last two nights including tonight with the main reason me simply feeling like I am afraid to die and I am not ready to die and I don't have a strong enough faith in God to be ready to die. It just scares me to the point of creating a panic/super high anxiety.  So now I am confused and would appreciate any help. My wife asked if I should get back on the Lexapro? I know that would help but I originally took the Lexapro for Anxiety and Depression and I will say I don't feel much depression anymore. I just really want to fight off getting back on Lexapro as I was on it for 5 years and do feel it contributed somewhat to my weight gain and even more to my lack of sex drive. Since getting off the Lexapro over the past month, we have already had sex 3 times which is more than the previous 6 months. My sex drive isn't still like it was in 2005 but an improvement is an improvement. I also will say that for me nights are by far the toughest. During the day I am always feeling good, working hard, not thinking about anything but work. But during the night, it just hits me and the fear immediately sets it, and the fear is death, of dying. My wife also thinks maybe counseling. Personally I have been to counseling over the years and other than myself getting a stronger faith in God, I don't see that helping. I would greatly appreciate any help here. I also don't want to rely on the Xanix to the point where I get addicted. Which leads me to the question, is taking 1mg of Xanix every night to sleep an addiction? I would love to see if anyone else has a problem similar to mine and get some help. Or even get in a group as I have felt better just reading other peoples stories. Thanks for listening to my story and thanks in advance for any help, Sincerely, Scott "

PTSD Panic Attacks?,"I have been on Thorazine in the past for severe PTSD panic episodes, it was discontinued because it started to plummet by blood pressure, it had never done it before (I was on it for 8 years) but the doctors didn't want to take any chances that it would continue. My blood pressure is now sky high, (stroke & heart attack range) I am on two blood pressure meds that have been doubled. I am trying to get it back because I had a SEVERE PTSD panic episode on Saturday 5/22 and my blood pressure went to 188/136 & heart rate 128, it has been 6 days and it hasn't come down much, today 142/104 & pulse 102. There was 127 motorcycles that went by me very fast & loud with three police escorts for some kind of rally. I don't deal with bikes well because of something that happened that I have not dealt with. Can't find someone professional that I can trust. Our local Mental Health Center violated my rights twice this year & now closed my case because I went to my primary care doctor with this info. She will be calling them tomorrow 5/28 after my appt. with her. I wish she was a psychiatrist, she is great and doesn't put me down for having a mental illness like others have. WHAT DO I DO NOW? My primary care doctor is not comfortable with prescribing psychiatric drugs like this but it is the only thing that helps me when I get like this. I'm on Paxil 40mg in the morning & 2mg of Ativan at bedtime, not helping & not sleeping. I've tried Klonopin, Risperadol, Prozac, and many others, nothing helps like Thorazine. I have noone to prescribe for me now & I'm getting desperate.

Panic Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/starting-lexapro-panic-attacks-worse-3430958.html,Starting Lexapro when I'm already having panic attacks. Will they get worse?,"I've been having pretty bad panic attacks for a few weeks. My doctor prescribed me .5 mg of Klonopin in the morning and another .5 mg later in the day, and suggested that after a week, I taper to just .5 mg in the morning. That did NOT work and I got panic attacks at night, so I went back to two a day until my next appointment just a few days later. Klonopin's still helping, but not as much as it previously had, presumably due to tolerance. Just tonight, I got a relatively mild but definitely very scary panic attack, just a few hours after my second dose of Klonopin. (Maybe I was just stressed out from thinking about the stuff in this post.) Tomorrow morning, I'm starting on 5 mg of Lexapro a day, in addition to Klonopin. My doctor advised that since Lexapro can cause anxiety during the first few days, I should keep taking Klonopin for the time being, but start tapering it 3 or 4 days in, once that initial phase had passed. Here's my fear: for the first few days, Lexapro ups my anxiety and the odds/intensity of panic attacks, my current Klonopin dose doesn't solve the problem because it's already weakening, and I have a really horrible experience. (And of course, the fact that I have this fear in the first place isn't helping.) Am I wrong to fear this? And if not, what can I do? I stupidly didn't think to ask my doctor if a higher dose of Klonopin might be okay in the short term while I adjust to Lexapro, but would it be? I'm nervous about this. I have a good feeling about what Lexapro will do for me, but I'm scared that the next few days could be horrible. Thanks for any advice. "

I have panic attacks, spasms, blurring of speech, the whole nine. I have tried Lexapro for about 2 and a half weeks with less than desirable results. After returning to my primary physician (internal medicine), she prescribes me Impram HCL (imipramine) to take along with Lexapro. Now correct me if I'm wrong but this website warns against the usage of the two together. I have taken it for 3 nights, the 4th night I had very quick fluctuations in body temperature. My girl friend noticed my face was screaming red and told me to take my shirt off which helped. I am still feeling the effects such as joint pain and what seems to be dilated pupils.

Is this normal?,"Hi there!! I'm sorry if the experience I'm about to describe has a really obvious answer. I'm just very worried and unsure. I started Cipralex 2 weeks ago now for severe panic disorder and depression. Was told by doctor to do 5 mg for the first week. Then bump up to 10 mg in the second week. I take it every morning at about 9. I had no side effects aside from some bloating/gas and yawning a lot. Panic attacks stopped although that might just be placebo? However, the past few nights, I've been feeling so terrible. I am okay during the day but at night, I feel as if I can't breathe and my heart feels like it's racing and sometimes it feels like my heart sinks/pulses. I feel shivers as well. My legs twitch a lot too. It makes me extremely anxious listening to my heart beat so loudly. It might not actually be loud or fast but my anxiety causes me to focus on it. I'm not sure if the shortness of breath is caused by the bloating? Also not sure if this is just anxiety or something more serious like serotonin syndrome which I've heard about. I won't be seeing my doctor for another week unfortunately. I'm wondering if this is normal or indicative of something more serious? I'm just very anxious and worried that there is something else wrong with me. I don't know if I should visit a hospital or if these are just panic attacks again. I was doing rather well for the most part but these past few nights have been brutal. Thank you to anyone who reads this! I hope I can figure this out. "

I have had panic attacks and anxiety since childhood. Effexor does not seem to be helping much anymore and my new doctor prescribed Imipramine 25mg at bedtime for 1 week to start and then increase to 50mg at bedtime thereafter. Am I right to be afraid to take these medications together? It was a new doctor who prescribed it as my former doctor will be retiring, both docs are psychiatrists. I discussed with the new doc about my wishes to maybe change to a different medication because I would like to consider the possibility of conceiving a child in the next year or so. Ideally I would like to be drug free when I start trying to conceive. I am a 36 year old female, my husband is 42 and he had testicular cancer (had one removed) and there is a possibility that we may have to conceive using IVF (invitro fertilization). IVF will cost about 10 thousand for each treatment and would love to know what other medications that may be more safe (if there is such a thing) I have tried to gradually taper down my Venlafaxine in the past few years, but the withdrawal symptoms are difficult to manage and my anxiety seems to worsen. The use of Ativan (lorazepam) while trying to withdraw does not seem to help at all. Xanax (alprazolam) is very effective but I hesitate to use it because it will just be yet another drug that I will have to withdraw from. Is there a lesser of two evils? I would love to take a year off work and try to go drug free for reproductive purposes, but if IVF is going to be used, I need to work in order to afford even considering a child. Without meds I have trouble leaving the house and during the last time I tried to withdraw from Effexor, I lost my job because of the horrible withdrawal symptoms that included the worst anxiety imaginable... my hair fell out in clumps, horrible itchy hives/rash that I could not stop scratching even when taking antihistamines. I have tried hypnosis, but seems I cannot be hypnotized. Other drugs/remedies tried over the past 23 years were Luvox, Paxil, Wellbutrin, BuSpar, hydroxyzine, meditation, yoga, 5HTP, L-theanine, high doses of Omega 3, melatonin, Melissa, lemon balm. CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) seems to help, but my anxiety seems to creep back regardless. Any thoughts, suggestions and advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. "

I started at half a Mg a day sometimes only 1-3 a week and stopped for a month when I realized I Started taking it everyday. That was the first and only time i stopped. Fast forward to today I am currently taking 1mg a day sometimes I will take 1.5. There’s been days where I’ve took up to 2-2.5 mg a day never more then that. And that never lasted more then a day or two just due to the fact of my grandmother passing and other times like losing my job.

He wrote me for it and said we should try our best to sart tapering off of it. My true question is if anybody is willing to help give some advice on how I could taper off and what to expect I’ve read so much online. Mainly the seizure and horrible pain withdraws scare me the most! Am open to all comments and advice even the tough ones that others can’t handle. I know it’s not the best drug to get dependent on and unlike some other people I won’t say I wish I never took it because it did help and has been helping.

I did try 1mg Ativan & 1 Immovane for sleep but it was no help. I was previously taking 100mg Tramadol, 5/325 oxycodone as needed, 1mg Ativan, 7.5mg Immovane, and sometimes 25mg Elavil. When I check my meds for drug interactions it says I can't take Elavil-Mirapex, but it also says I can't take Elavil-Tramadol or half my meds with Tramadol, but have been for years not knowing there was any risk! Has anyone taken the Cymbalta-Mirapex combo and had to use something for insomnia? I don't know if I can go another night like this, I feel so terrible the next day I can't do anything but sit around. "

Low(er) heart rate and hot flashes / quick spike in body temp, sedative?","Today is my 3rd day of taking buspirone. I was originally supposed to take 5mg once a day “as needed” for anxiety. Took it 1st day after doc appointment (for severe anxiety) at 4pm fell asleep at5pm and stayed asleep until 730am the next morning. I felt so happy stress-free and amazing when I woke up (had to take my 1st dose of citalopram 20mg that morning) but felt amazing pretty much the whole day. That night didn’t get to sleep til 2am. But wasn’t anxious, so no buspirone. At 7.30am took my second dose of citalopram and started getting a bit anxious and chest pains. Til later in the day, I was full blown panic. I took another buspirone and fell asleep. I woke up early today and called my doc about the heightened anxiety and chest pain when I started citalopram. She told me to not take it. Took a 1/2 buspirone to see if that would relieve my anxiety/ chest pains and not sedate me (put me to sleep)... it did but only for a couple of hours. I Have been having mild anxiety all day today, not as bad as yesterday and took another 1/2 buspirone at about 4pm to keep anxiety low. Anyways, I tend to be paranoid about my heart rate and is a HR tracker on my phone to keep track of how my hearts beating and I notice some of my readings are super low (for me) I’m used to running anywhere between 75-90bpm and have had some readings between 55-70bpm. Is Buspar/buspirone known to do that? Also I get occasional spikes in body temperature, what feels like hot flashes. Is this normal? It might also be that I am combating my thyroid at the same time. So my body temperature is never really normal as it is anyways. Also, will the sedative effect eventually go away? Because I liked how 5mgs made me felt AFTER my 14hr nap.

I've tried countless meds like paxil, lexapro, Zoloft, effexor, buspar, Xanax and a few more that I can't remember off hand. Xanax worked great but I get these attacks so often that I would need to take it everyday which I didn't like because I noticed severe withdraws when I didn't take them so I stopped taking them. I also have ADHD so my doctor now has prescribed me 20mg xr once a day, celexa 20mg once a day at night, and Klonopin for emergency situations. Anyone currently on these meds? If so what are your experiences with combining these? "

Insomnia,https://www.drugs.com/answers/severe-insomnia-feel-exhausted-options-3474207.html,"Severe insomnia, feel I have exhausted all options, please help?","So in the past year and a half, my doctor has tried me on every sleep medication imaginable. From ""z"" drugs such as Ambien and Lunesta to Seroquel to benzos. Typically a medication will work for anywhere from a few weeks to a few months and then it abruptly stops working to treat my insomnia, so far the best medication I've found is to be mirtazapine, unfortunately it stopped working after a few months. I'm currently on mirtazapine and clonazepam. Originally it worked for a while but as of late, I find the only way to fall asleep is to drink about a 6 pack (on top of my medicines) in order to obtain even a few hours of sleep. Prior to the medication my primary issue was with sleep onset, on my current regimen I find that is no longer an issue, but i wake up frequently throughout the night. Recently, I switched doctors and was prescribed Belsomra, which was then rejected by my insurance company, they requested that I try Rozerem first. I have yet to try it, as I am afraid of potential rebound insomnia/anxiety I may experience from cutting out the clonazepam /alcohol (my doctor doesn't think I need to be weened off). So my question is: A: how effective is Rozerem in regards to sleep onset, and B: can I expect any adverse effects from abruptly stopping the clonazepam (2mg a night) and the alcohol C: is it safe to take either the clonazepam or mirtazapine in the event that the Rozerem doesn't work after say a few hrs. My overall goal is to get of narcotics entirely but I'm afraid of what the results may be as far as rebound effects from abruptly stopping my current routine. I feel as though I have exhausted any and all options as far sleep medications and am willingly to take any advice that may help. I maintain my sleep hygiene as best as I can (no screens 1 hr before bed, bedroom is only used for sleep, etc.) What can I do? "

So I'm going to keep this as short and simple as possible. I suffer from anxiety and depression. I didn't really suffer from panic attacks, just some GAD I guess. I got prescribed citalopram and after prolonged hesitation, I decided to take it. And I decided I was going to be positive about taking it seeing as I felt I was at a point where I needed to try something new to battle this anxiety. With that being said, Friday I started taking the citalopram at 2.5 mg. I felt fine mostly. I had a panic attack on the third day but I assumed it was because I was an hour or so behind on taking the med. I also had no appetite whatsoever which is very much unlike me. Wednesday morning I woke up in panic and sick to my stomach and couldn't eat, felt like my whole body was overheating especially my head, and I was throwing up. I tried what I usually do to calm down but it wasn't working and I found myself just pacing and talking until it passed. Later that night around midnight, it happened again but it only was escalating by the hour. Full blown panic that I had never experienced and I just wanted it to go away. I took an Ativan (note that I hate taking medications of any kinds but I was desperate) all it did was stop my body from shaking but my mind was still in a panic. I was utterly distraught. I couldn't sleep and when I did it, I would wake up every few minutes with more panic. I went to my doctors office and they didn't help in the least. They were very insensitive and made me come in knowing the state of panic I was in. They just kept saying how that's weird because meds don't do that and it was only five days and at such a low dose. All I wanted to know was how much longer will the citalopram be in my system because every day I'm having panic attacks and it's worse at night and it's just overall unbearable. If anyone could share their advice or experiences on this medication I would really appreciate it. "

I went from sleeping 12 hours of restful sleep to insomnia for days to 7 hours of fitful horrible sleep. But why? The teva brand never made me manic? I slept great on it!  I'm about 2 weeks off of pristiq, side effects like insomnia should be lessened now right? I've been on Cymbalta before with no problems...  Can one brand of Klonopin induce mania while another doesn't? I've never been fully manic before only hypomanic. I'm so confused and just want sleep!!! "

Panic Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/depakote-er-250mg-concerned-3455146.html,Depakote ER 250mg - should I be concerned?,"I was prescribed 250mg of Depakote ER to take once at night. I will also take this in conjunction to Klonopin if I feel the need, since my psych is using the Depakote for anxiety and to stabilize my mood. After reading what Depakote is for however, and all the side effects such as vomiting, upset stomach, hair loss, weight gain, etc. I am not only kind of not wanting to start it, but am wondering if he gave me the appropriate medication since it sounds like it is for mania or more bipolar symptoms. I used to take Klonopin 2mg daily about 5 years ago and that helped with the anxiety, then I had a period where I didn’t feel I needed any medication, and now that I am experiencing periods of random panic and anxiety again a few years later, he refuses to go on that amount of Klonopin daily as I was previously taking, and has me on .5mg to take as needed; along with the Depakote. My other choice was lithium, and I have read bad things about that prior to seeing him so that was a definite no go for me. My question is, is with this amount of Depakote (250mg once a day) if I should be worried about the side effects such as toxicity to the liver, hair loss, weight gain, vomiting, etc etc etc. I want to get better and for something to help, and I know the Klonopin works so that is kind of upsetting he wouldn’t refill that to a higher dose, I guess I am just not sure about this new medication. I am also getting sick (cold) so will also probably be taking mucinex or something in the near future so wondering if I should just wait until everything passes. The Klonopin gets me by for now when I have panicky episodes, but as said, I know he won’t prescribe that as often or as much as I would need it, so eventually would need something else. Just wondering if Depakote was the right thing. I know I won’t know until I try it, but just needing reassurance, personal experience, something..I am just not looking forward to starting it unless I know it will help. "

I've had panic disorder since 19, I'm now 38. I've had a prescription for Xanax (0.5 mg) for most of those years, though I never took it consistently. I would maybe take it during a bad panic attack to calm down, during a flight, or to sleep once in a while. No more than 1 mg a week, and that was during peak anxiety times, which were inconsistent. Since October though I have been going through a really bad bout of my panic disorder. I am now having several panic attacks a day and just have this general uneasiness and anxiety when I'm not panicking. I have developed agoraphobia and am avoiding places and people. I even have trouble going to work. I started seeing a psychiatrist for med management last year and she switched me from lexapro to prozac in November. That adjustment has been hard and I feel like I start each and every day panicking. My psychiatrist says it is OK to take the xanax right now, as prescribed, 0.5 mg, up to three times a day as needed. For the past week, I have taken about 0.75 mg every day. I have needed to just to get to work and stay at work. On the weekends, I try not to take it if I don't have to. Today I took 0.25 mg because I was just panicky and feeling icky. I do not want to become dependent on this drug and I'm having trouble wondering if it is my anxiety making me feel this way, or the prozac, or perhaps even withdrawal from the Xanax. My doctor says it is safe for now since I need to get out of the house and work, but of course I have heard the horror stories and since I already have anxiety and alot of anxiety about my health, I worry about taking Xanax every day and the implications.

Panic Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/need-advice-on-coming-of-lexapro-after-5-weeks-191682.html,Need advice on coming off Lexapro after 5 weeks?,"I was prescibed 10MG of Lexapro daily after having a serious panic attack. The Dr also prescibed Lorazepam @ 3 x .5 MG daily until the Lexapro kicked in. I am just about off of the Lorazepam.  I want to come off of the Lexapro as well because like many people, it has killed my interest in anything and basically made me a zombie. Worse yet, when I excercise, it appears that Lexapro converts the excercise endorphins to something like caffiene because I can't sleep at all on the nights that I excercise. The reason that I had the panic attack is well understood (to me, but perhaps not my Dr) - I had another unrelated medical condition (vasal vagal syncope due to low-sodium), and when they did a tilt-table test, my heart stopped for 8 seconds. Then I was prescribed pills that made me sicker and things got worse from there until I found the real cause - stress induced adrenal fatigue and low sodium in my blood. In other words, I am very fortunate that I do not have GAD or depression; either of which might require longer time on Lexapro. So I just don't think that I need to be on Lexapro. So now my question - does anybody have a withdrawal strategy for somebody who has only been on Lexapro for 6 weeks? "

It was so bad and only getting more debilitating. shaking, rocking, screaming, crying, heart palps, twitching, couldn't eat. just out of my mind thnking I was dying. I started calling people and saying goodbye. Called the pdoc and he said to try antihistamines. that only made it worse. went to my primary doc, and he immediately gave me an Ativan .5mg I didn't want to take it because I was so dependent on it years ago, I was afraid. but I took it and it brought me down to a normal level. then he said to take another2 hours later, felt a little better for a while, then got jittery by the evening. Then I had to take another whole 1mg at bedtime. after 30 mins I got really shaKy from in and then finally went to sleep. I forgot to mention, during my week of panic, I only slept 2 hours a night. so this time I slept 8 hours, but woke up so jittery,and loopy. do you think 1mg is just to strong? is 1/2 better. doc is planning on starting me on a regular ssri next week, but keeping me on Ativan, 1mg a night for about 3 weeks. I certainly don't ant to go against his help, but is 1mg to strong? does 1mg last longer that 1/2 or is it just the strength of it? He's going to ease in Lexapro slowly next week. Do I likely have an underlying anxiety or panic disorder or is it the meds messing with me? WILL BEING ON ATIVAN GET ME HOOKED AFTER 3 WEEKS? DOC SAYS NO?? Thank you for reading AND ANY HELP YOU CAN OFFER. "

Confused - Positive feedback please?,"Hi, I am new to this forum and apologize for this lengthy post. I have been on Zoloft 50mg and 0.5mg of Klonopin for the past 12 years. I was put on it when my mother died of cancer for panic attacks and anxiety, no depression. I have lived a very happy, healthy life during these 12 years, very little anxiety, slept well and have been very successful at work and hobbies etc... About 4 months ago, I started to have heartburn on daily basis. It was not bad, minor pain that would go away with tums etc.. but I came to find out that I do have health anxiety that I was not aware of. Looking up issues about daily heartburn on the web scared me and my anxiety went up, not too much, but I was thinking about my heartburn all the time. I worried it can give me cancer as I had read in some posts.  I was working and still living in my own house 3 months ago. My PDr. increased the Zoloft to 75mg and my anxiety went though the roof. I called him 4 days later and mentioned that to him, he asked me to drop it back down to 50mg again. I had a panic attack the next day, had not had one in 12 years. He insisted that I should increase Zoloft to 150mg. I listened and went up to 112.5,g and could not tolerate the anxiety anymore. I was taking 2.5mg Klonopin to calm down. I would wake up with high levels of anxiety and could not calm down without Klonopin, a warm shower and going for a walk. I took 2-3 showers a day. Well things got so bad that I had to take time off of work. It has been almost 3 months now since I have been off of work. I saw a different doctor about 2 months ago and we both decided that Zoloft was too high and starred lowering it. It was helping very little, and anxiety was still high. Bringing Zoloft down by even 6mg was making me nauseous for 2 days and more anxiety and morning wake ups at 5:00 am with severe anxiety would not go away.  He decided to take me off of Zoloft and start me on Lexapro. I took a month to lower Zoloft to 25mg. I started on 5mg Lexapro 14 days ago and noticed a difference within the first week. It was not like I was cured, but I was a little better. I started to have days that I wanted to do things and interact with people. Very little side effects in the first ~10 days. 3 days ago, I lowered the Zoloft from 25mg to 18mg and my anxiety started to go up again. I am panicky and today, I feel very sleepy and panicky (I can not take naps in the past 3 months because I wake up with anxiety). These are all per PDr. instructions. My PDr. says to increase the Lexapro to 7.5mg and I am worried about increased side effects which I had little when I started 5mg two weeks ago. I am not sure what to do at this point? I need to be able to get back to my life and work and this whole thing has taken 3 months and has put my whole life on hold. I am not even staying in my own house because of a bit of fear of ""what if"" something goes wrong. I want to be off of Zoloft completely before going back to my house. Any positive advice please? Does Lexapro work at 5mg? Is it normal to have these up and down days at first. How can I get rid of the remaining 18mg Zoloft without these severe side effects? Thank You much "

The 5mg dose of amlodipine was shortly afterwards upped to 10mg after an appointment at a hypertension clinic, but the 100mg sertraline remained. The initial dose and increased dose of amlodipine made me feel, not tired as such, but lethargic, however this had passed by some weeks later. More recently I've been prescribed propranolol 40mg in addition to sertraline 100mg for a general anxiety disorder. Adding the propranolol seems to have left me almost entirely drained of any energy. For example I fell asleep at around 1am last night and slept through till 12pm today, and this is not an isolated incident. It isn't so much lethargy as much as just absolute tiredness. I've searched around the internet looking for negative or sleep inducing interactions between these meds but haven't been able to find anything remotely conclusive. Just wondered if anyone has had a similar experience with any or all of these drugs? Thanks. "

I have suffered from depression and anxiety most of my life. I began taking Effexor around the age of 21 (43 now). A couple years ago I had a traumatic event that threw me into terrible anxiety and panic. I have felt like I'm literally losing it at times. I've tried upping my dose of Effexor XR with only increased anxiety and panic. I'm currently taking Effexor, Buspar, and Xanax as needed, along with weekly EMDR. I've heard some good things about citalopram for anxiety but I'm scared to switch due to potential worsening of symptoms. I just want to get my anxiety under control. Some common symptoms I've been experiencing include panic, mind going blank, derealization, denationalization, and feel like I'm living in a dream or not real. It's terrible. Can someone give me some advice? Has anyone switched from Effexor (SNRI) to citalopram (SSRI)? "

And, no, I'm not suicidal, nor have I ever been suicidal. It seems like I've always been depressed. In elementary school, I was bullied into depression by 5th grade. Then middle school came, and not only was I bullied at school , but I was bullied at home as well. Though my parents are divorced, they are both still in contact with one another. I live with my grandmother. My mom has legal custody of me, though. She's verbally abusive towards almost everyone, but she says the most unholy things to me. She's called me a mistake, told me she doesn't care about me, she's even told me I'm going to hell. I'm probably one of the most innocent 16 year olds in America..all I do is go to school. Ive never done anything bad enough to deserve severe bullying at home and at school. I can't deal anymore. Its because of her loud, verbally abusive self that I have anxiety as bad as I do. I can't function. I never forget all the terrible things that she said to me. They replay over and over again in my head throughout the day. Not a day goes by that I don't cry, if its not me feeling sorry for myself, then its me thinking about how much better my life could potentially be.

I have been taking Plaquenil for about 1-1/2 years,?","... 200 mg. twice a day. I was diagnosed with RA around that time. It had started, apparently, years ago with what they called ""palindromic rheumatism"", which affected my wrists and hands. It was very painful, but lasted only a few days. I was put on Plaquenil back in 1999 and took for only a few months and the condition went into remisson, so I stopped taking the drug, Then in late 2012 I started getting carpal tunnel-like symptoms that came on like gangbusters! I had to miss several days of work due to the condition. My rheumatologist said I had osteoarthritis and then said it had progressed to RA. Mostly my wrists hands and arms are affected. Numb, tingly and painful. Can hardly bend my fingers sometimes and opening doors and jars is painful. I typed for many years on the job. I am now retired. Age 58. Anyhoo... my rheumatologist now wants me to start on Methotrexate at 2.5 mg (3 tabs, so really 7.5 mg) once a week, in addition to the Plaquenil. I'm a little scared to do this. I am a person who reads all about the potential side effects and they do scare me. Plus, I admit I'm a bit of a hypochondriac, so my mind runs away sometimes with all this information. Just as an aside, I went gluten free 16 months ago and the effect was phenomenal! After 2 months GF, I felt like doing cartwheels! I am still GF and I'm sure it helps, but I haven't been eating as ""clean"" as I once was. Anyway, my rheumy feels that I ""am tolerating a lot more pain than I should"" and feels that the ""window of time"" to treat RA is becoming short.

I noticed that the Paxil wasn't quite working as well as it used to so I went to the Dr who prescribed venlafaxine er. I started with 75mg for one month and then increased my dose to 150mg. Then after a couple of months the Dr upped my dose to 225mg. After a few days on 225mg, I began having severe muscle stiffness and muscle pain. The pain was debilitating so I weaned myself back down to 75mg and went to a new Dr. The new Dr prescribed me 50 mg of Pristiq but it made me very dizzy and nauseous so I only took it for a week. I switched myself back to 75 mg of venlafaxine until I can get back into see my Dr next week. I'm still have headaches and dizziness which I don't remember being this bad when I initially started the venlafaxine 4 months ago. I did do pretty good when I was taking 150mg venlafaxine, however I have so much stress in my life the Dr thought it may be beneficial to increase my dose to 225mg which then caused muscle problems. So, should I try to get back to the 150mg of venlafaxine er or should I try going back on Paxil?? The Paxil WAS THE ABSOLUTE BEST, but I'm not sure if it will work again for me. Also, I've taken .5 mg of klonopin as needed with both paxil and venlafaxine, however I never really needed it on paxil. This is so frustrating as I'm a Mother, a wife and I work full time. "

Do I need to worry about withdrawal?,"I was prescribed 0.5 mg Klonopin eight months ago to take as needed for crippling panic attacks. For the first six months I only needed to take one dose 3 times total.

It works great for me, but of course I’m concerned about the risks of dependence and possible withdrawal symptoms if I find I don’t need a dose for several weeks.  I’ve been trying other natural methods to manage my anxiety like meditation, exercise, vitamins & supplements. I’m hoping to get this under control without needing the benzo as often.  My question is, is there a risk to withdrawal symptoms if I don’t need a dose for several weeks? If I can get back to taking it only when nothing else works?

I had felt?,"... like someone beat me with a baseball bat or I was hit by a semi. That is what made me seek answers. 10 years before that I was diagnosed with Osteoarthritis. They did not do blood work at the time so I guess they may have misdiagnosed. I was on methotrexate for about 2 years until my insurance company decided in the middle of a plan year not to cover it anymore. They wouldn't cover any treatment medications at that point. Not even Celebrex. In August I left my job. It was too physically demanding on me. I have pain in all areas possible from toe to neck. Since my diagnosis I had lived by the motto ""Just keep moving!"". Well without any medications and winter setting in I am not wanting to move at all. I hesitate looking for new work because I cannot think of anything that I can handle doing anymore. Sitting for long periods is impossible. I have degenerative discs in my back. I was mistakenly given an antibiotic for an ear infection a few months ago that made things worse for me. I didn't really have much issues with my knees until 2 days after I started taking Levaquin. Now I cannot squat or kneel down at all. My knees sound like I am walking on broken glass when I go up or down stairs. Apparently there are some rare issues reported with this medication.  FYI: Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Arthralgia, myalgia, skeletal pain, tendinitis Frequency not reported: Arthritis, arthrosis, pathological fracture, osteomyelitis, synovitis, muscle weakness, tendon disorder Postmarketing reports: Tendon rupture, muscle injury (including rupture), increased muscle enzymes, rhabdomyolysis I spend my time pondering on what to do now.

Recently ( starting around 7 months ago roughly) ive been experiencing moderate to severe (level 6-7.5 for me and thats bad like id rather have a broken arm or something than this) and finally ( 3 weeks ago) got up the nerve to drag myself to my general family doc to see what the deal with this bone and joint pain / stiffness ive been experiencing was all about. He ran a slew of blood labs ranging from lupus to HIV everything accept my blood pressure and heart rates were "" just fine, very normal"" i was stunned and finally my doc and i came to the conclusion that this issue was beyond him and i needed a re feral to see the rheumatologist. The best rheumatologist around was luckily who i was referred to see. My doc understood the amount of pain i was in so he prescribed me 15 10 mg oxycodone IR pills i was to take one at bed since the pain has been severely effecting my sleep ( even with a recent bump 300mgs of xr seruquel to help with sleep from my psych doc)... i was very grateful to say the least but was concerned about inflamation/ potential joint damage so he prescribed me 600mgs of Daypro to take when i wake up. Its Been 3 weeks since that point things are getting a little worse pain wise during the day the swelling of my joints has gone down and im now splitting the oxycodone in half taking one 5mg half when i wake and the other a few hours before bed docs orders since the whole pill at bed was actually to stimulating for sleep and made my insomnia worse so he ordered the split daytime dose. I have 10 more days until i see the RH doc and the oxycodone is helping alot during the day but it seems to have a much SHORTER duration than it did when i started taking it a few weeks ago... what should i be prepared for before i walk in to the Rheumatoid docs office? My mother goes with me to most of my appointments so she keeps all of my records for me ( love my mom she makes my life berrable shes just awesome with helping me get around to the docs etc) in a nice organised manner since ive got so many med / lab records. Anyways im still in alot of pain had all of my meds (lyrica, a 300 mg xr seroquel 5mg oxycodone 2hrs ago and 200mg lyrica 10mg propranalol) after all of those meds im still starting to hurt badly ( a 7.5 out of 10) would it be plausible to ask the rheumatologist to write me something thats NOT instant release like the NOT IR oxy as im getting desperate pain wise i cant get a restful nights sleep at all anymore and to be honest typing this is extremely uncomfortable as well eve with both wrists braced heating pad etc im close to being in agony. Any other insite as to what i should be doing to prepare for my rheumatologist visit and to possibly help alleviate some of this pain im in. THINGS IVE TRIED SO FAR : oxycodone ( most effective) dayrpo antiinflamatory,2 hot showers today with icy hot right afterwards drinking water taking vitamin e and b12 supplaments from the doc via IV, point cortosone injections in my neck ( was awful i DO NOT respond well to steroids the seem to make me manic and out of controll) amongst other things ( a small ammount of high grade cannabis with a buddy helped alot with the joint side of pain wnt from a 7.5 to a 5 with just my normal meds and 5mg oxy and cannabis) Sorry for any run ons or misspelled words / bad grammer its a chore to type with two full wrist braces on haha God BLess you all and have a awesome night!

I would usually not wake fully even when my husband woke me to take my medicine, I be so asleep I would have no memory of taking my medicine. I might sleep 10 hours or more. I've been trying Lyrica for just over a week & it's really messing with my head in many ways. My mood swings are extreme, the slightest thing makes me angry or sad. It's even messing with my ability to explain myself coherently right now! I want to stop taking it, but my pharmacist is strongly encouraging me to go for 2 weeks to see if my side effects go away. That's the usual procedure. I don't think I can stand it. I feel like I'm completely out of control. I took Lyrica before, many years ago & I quit because of side effects then. My doctor says that since my other meds are so different now I might not have the same reaction. Ha! This is worse, i think, since I can't remember the exact effects I had last time, except that it messed with my moods. My doctor is very reluctant to increase my opioid medication or give me an opioid medication for breakthrough pain that I had before because of the bad reputation opioids have now because of other doctors over prescribing for acute pain, leaving people with more than they need & other family members, especially kids abusing them! I've been on opioids about 20 years and never abused them. My doctor knows this, but the prevailing popular opinion is causing him to over react in my opinion. So now I'm in almost constant severe pain, and having to take medication that at best doesn't work, and at the worse is causing me more pain and other very unpleasant side effects. Sigh. Sorry I wandered from my initial topic, but this seem to be a side effect of Lyrica as well. I can't concentrate and wander all over the place. It's very tiring but I can't stop till the pain of typing is so bad I can't continue. My friends are getting strange messages from me since I started talking Lyrica.

In any event, I've had bad luck with Rheumatologists, so I went back to my general. He did my first & second infusion, however, his staff is TERRIBLE! The girls never ordered the proper infusion supplies, so the doctor literally took a giant needle, attached a tube and pushed through the vials of remicade directly into my bloodstream in 10 minutes, probably less! This happened both times! I researched this online b/c I was aware on how it should be administered, and obviously it wasn't supposed to be administered that way! So now i'm seeing a Rhematologist who is doing my 3rd ever infusion the right way. My question is what are the side effects of having it done improperly that way? Do you think my body flushed it out? I feel no better at all. The new Rheumy wouldn't even believe me that it was administered that way! he just kept shaking his head! Do you think that it could have caused some more severe organ damage possibly? I'm very concerned!

I am asking for advice about when to take these medications due to the CNS/respiratory depressant effects they have. Here is a list of my current medications and their instructions: Pristiq 100 mg 1x daily, Clonazepam 0.5 mg 4x daily if needed, Baclofen 10 mg 3x daily, Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen 10/325 4x daily if needed, Promethazine 12.5 mg 4x daily if needed, and Morphine Sulfate ER 15 mg 2x daily. The Morphine was just added today for chronic pain, was told to take it twice daily and the Norco as needed for breakthrough pain. I had been taking the Pristiq, Norco, and Baclofen first thing in the morning, followed by Clonazepam if I am anxious, and Promethazine if I am nauseous. I take the Norco every 4-6 hours, the Baclofen every 6 hours. Now that I will be taking Morphine in the a.m with the Pristiq and Baclofen, I was wondering how long I would need to wait before I could take a Norco if necessary. And 15 mg of Morphine Sulfate ER 2x daily, is 8 hours a part ok, or does it have to be 12 hours? The time btwn the Norco and Morphine are my biggest concern, but I have the Baclofen, Clonazepam, and Promethazine also in the mix. I just don't want to have CNS problems where I can't think, hypotension & dizziness where I have to be sitting/laying down or I'll pass out, and drowsiness where I have to sleep except for at bedtime. I also don't want to have breathing problems. I have mild Asthma, usually brought on by allergies in which case I take benadryl but only if I haven't had to take the Promethazine because they are in the same drug class. So... if anyone could help me with my medication schedule I would really appreciate it. I take my first meds as early as 7 am or as late as 10 am depending on my morning, and my last meds as early as 8-9 pm or as late as 11pm-12 depending on my night. Thank you in advance!

Panic Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/feeling-freak-very-lonely-anxiety-depression-1066896.html,"Feeling like a freak & very lonely, Anxiety & Depression off the 'rictor scale'?","I've struggled with generalized anxiety, agoraphobia, & depression for the majority my life, but for the most part have overcome so much of it. However, my living arrangements, losing my kids because I am poor, constantly arguing with my elderly mum & the holidays, have me at the end of my rope. No, I am not suicidal... Been there, done that, so to speak... many failed attempts in my youth, & a horrific childhood, led me to helping others overcome their issues. -This is where part of the problem lies... Since I am now, more or less the therapist, I have no place to turn when I am in need of help of a friend or listening ear. I've been pretty much a recluse, since before Christmas, & going downhill fast. Since my return to the states, from Scotland last May to help my mum & work the tornado disasters, it all seems hopeless. Aye, people tell me all the things I should be doing but aren't, or could be doing but won't, but they never offer any form of a support system. So-called Christians just shout words & tell me to have faith --I'm a Deacon, btw, [currently doing online school to finish], & being in the states, I don't understand these persons either--- I am one to help another, no matter what; I don't just shout empty words, walk away or give up. I work with abused kids/teens, & do benefit concerts to raise money to give to shelters to help both them & animals. I have a concert coming up & can't focus at all, however I did have one good day after answering a few q&a's on here, as I was finally able to walk down to a store, but that turned bad also. My elderly mum and I are basically what you would call ""Homeless with a roof"". The persons in mum's town here are the ones I was talking of at the beginning of my post. They even put us on the news, followed with loads of lies... I constantly look for work & a place for her to move to, but thanks to the news, it's futile. People see me walking around town, & turn their heads, wishing I wasn't a part of their community, they won't allow mum to return to Sr. Citizen center for lunch & games, etc. that helped her so. We have no car, fridge, stove, shower, electric or running water inside, & now our storage building has been burglarized recently & my clothing, & kid's were stolen.. Like many we struggle between buying our medications & food.. Like I told one, I am one to use my cat, or mum's service dog as 'furry Prozac' -tho' never taken Prozac, or I turn to my music, a book, Craig Ferguson, but all temporary fixes.  My heart feels like it is being ripped to shreds... another holiday, & when I walked down to the store I was talking to a few people standing around outside, as well as the clerk who came out to grab a smoke, then I heard the laughter aimed at me... ""Go back to the 'bottoms' ya f**kin freak"" ""Ya stupid idiot, you don't belong here"" & the such...  I broke my glasses recently, & can't replace, same goes for my dentures. --I keep forgetting how ugly or the 'freak' that I look to others, all because I'm the type to have never met a stranger... I strike up a conversation with almost anyone, until the hurtful words or laughter begins  I am unable to see my kids, all because my ex won't follow court orders, or I can't afford to buy them expensive gifts, so he will let me... My kids are my life, & I cannot change that yet, & I'm hurting so bad. I'd give anything for even a phone call from one of them.  I don't know how to help my mum anymore, nor fix anything more in this broken house, or face anyone all because of how I look... And I am getting infuriated when people tell me to 'move on', 'sometimes you just have to let go' or similar when it comes to my kids. Dang, you can't just run out and replace your child like you can an ex spouse! And now, when I picked up the 2 meds I am on yesterday, [they are a brand I can't tolerate] I can gain no help with that either. I take Clonazepam & Promethazine. This brand feels like I swallowed glass & makes me nauseated, but still, it hurts that I am not worth helping. --Not self-pity here, as I did abuse my meds many years ago, but now take less than prescribed to prove that I am not...  My apologies that this is all a jumble, but my anxiety is running high, so I don't always write things the way I mean to...  Any suggestions on how to deal with any of these issues would be greatly appreciated!!!  ~Just sign me, Hopeless & Lost "

He's trying to find the correct medication to ease my issues. When I went to fill my Script, I was told the system ""flagged"" me because there were three benzo prescriptions prescribed around the same time. Of course the reason for this is because he's trying to find the right cocktail to help me lead a life free of daytime anxiety and nighttime insomnia. The pharmacist was very kind and said that she would note in the system that my doc switched me from alprazolam to temazepam for sleep. My question is... because I was ""flagged"" will I now have issues EVERYTIME I go to the pharmacist? She filled the prescription for me when I suppose she could have just refused it. But does this flagging mean I'm inevitably going to have a hassle for all my prescriptions from Now on and for forever?

My cycle ranges from 28-32 days every month. Sometimes it comes a week after my expected period. Recently though, I had started my period on June 6, 2018 (Wednesday), and it ended on the 10th (Sunday). My period only lasted for 4 days. It was no big deal for me because as long as my period came, I'm okay. However, 3 days after my period ended, my boyfriend and I had sex and at first he didn't have condom on and he came, it was our first time having sex without a condom, but he said that he didn't came in me. He pulled out in time. I was still scared though, and we had a second round, this time he put on a condom, and I was on top, so when he came, I got off of him and he said that condom slipped off. At first I was really confused, but I noticed that the condom was inside of me. I don't think that his sperm went inside me or anything because the open part of the condom was facing down. I still freaked out, I took it out and ran to the bathroom to wipe myself off just in case any sperm got in me. Him and I had had a talk and he said that if I want, I could take the Plan B pill just in case. The next day (Thursday), within 24 hours, I took the pill and for a few days, I wasn't experiencing the side effects such as nausea, fatigue, breast tenderness, bleeding, bloating, etc. I was expecting it to happen, but it didn't so I was wondering if the pill worked or not since I felt like I'm the only one who didn't really experience any side effects based on my research on the Internet. However, this last few days I was experiencing bloating, mild cramps on my left and right side and abdominal pain, and I felt like I have to go use the bathroom often (I do not know if I have diarrhea or not... please don't judge me ):). Exactly this Thursday, when I went to go use the bathroom again. I saw spots of blood on my underwear and I freaked out and I texted my friends who had experienced this and they told me that it is because Plan B is a big dosage of hormones that can alter my body or menstrual cycle. It's been 3 days (Saturday) and I'm still bleeding but not as much as the one's on Thursday. But, I have noticed that I have gone #2 for 3 times today. And after I eat, I get this abdominal cramps that's mild, but sometimes I can feel a sharp pain, but goes away after a few minutes, and kind of comes back. Please help me?! I do not know what this is?? Is this implantation bleeding??? Pregnancy signs??? Or just Plan B working in my body? I know it can't be implantation because it usually takes days after fertilization for that to occur and I had sex like last week June 13th (so that can't be possible... it's too early). Am I getting my period twice this month or??? Your help is very much appreciated. Thank you! "

We had unprotected sex and he finished inside of me on Oct 16. Understanding from a pharmacist that plan b did not have abortant effect, I took plan b on Oct 17. On Oct 18, we had unprotected sex again and finished inside of me. (I did NOT take plan b again after this second incident.) I had spotting or a light period on Oct 20-21 for about 1.5 days (the withdrawal bleeding from the pill). About a week later, beginning on Oct 26 (9 days after taking the pill), I started feeling dizzy, nauseous, lower abdominal pains, cramps, fuller/squishier feeling breasts, daily temperatures of 99.5-100 degrees, hot flashes, and many other seeming symptoms of pregnancy/implantation, including (later on) darker, more pronounced veins in breasts, legs, and feet. I expected my next period on Nov 5, but it didn't come. I began taking hpts and had unclear/mixed results. Some tests looked negative or had very, very faint lines (maybe evaps). But other tests had clearer positive lines, still a little faint, but the line/color was unmistakably there (one FRER and three or four EPTs). If it were not for the mixed results (the negative or evap results), I would have believed I was pregnant based on the positive-looking results alone. The neg and very faint lines kept confusing me, though, as well as the fact that the clearer lines weren't really getting much darker. In the middle of all of this home testing, I went to my doctor for a blood test. It was negative, but afterward I continued feeling the pregnancy symptoms, so tested again and kept getting the faint (though unmistakable) lines. Finally, on Nov 21 (17 days late for my expected period **unless you count from the light 1.5 days bleeding I got after plan b), I got what I think was my period. But it only lasted for 1-2 days, which is very short for me. Another funny thing was that my breasts were NOT at all sore before I got this period, which is strange for me, as they are always very sore at least a week before my periods. Is there a chance I am pregnant? Did I have a chemical pregnancy or early miscarriage? For almost four weeks up until I started to bleed on Nov 21 (and even afterward) I have had cramps and abdominal pains, which I know can be associated with miscarriage. The abdominal pains are slightly less now after I bled, but still there on and off. I am also still dizzy and nauseous. Can anyone tell me what is happening or if this is normal after plan b? The drug info/insert for ban b describes side effects like I've had, but says symptoms don't last longer than 2-3 days. Mine started 9 days after taking the pill and have lasted over a month. I also know plan b is only 85% effective. Thank you so much for your help! "

Am I pregnant?,"Me and my boyfriend had sex 2 and a half to 3 weeks ago. We used a condom and it never broke nor did he ejaculate. During sex there was a frothy almost spit like substance near the base of the condom only 1 to 2 inches higher. I'm worried because I don't know if it was my personal lubrication or if it was his pre-*** leaking out of the bottom. I'm almost 100% sure I put his condom on correctly, and if it helps he did pee before this cleaning out any leftover semen he possibly had left that could've been in the pre-ejaculate. I expect my period within one to two days but so far today there is nothing. Last month my period didn't start until the 30th of June and my cycles are usually 31 days in between each period except for last month where it was irregular. I usually do not have super irregular periods, but they are definitely irregular. They usually happen around the 26th or 27th of each month but in June it was obviously delayed 4-5 days. But I had no sex during that time. So my question is if I should worry about pregnancy if my period happened to be irregular again this month as it was last month, except this time I had sexual intercouse. My breasts are slightly sore but other than that I've had no obvious symptoms. My breasts being sore is a monthly PMS symptom. Other things that could add to the slight delay in my period is my sleep schedule due to adjusting to different time zones and some stress. I just want my period to come soon. I don't feel I'm not responsible enough or old enough for a child and I've learned my lesson. No more until I can deal with consequences. Please help "

It's now been a week late and idk if it's because it's my first month without patch and maybe I'm not going to get it the same day as I used to (since it's not being controlled by it) or if it's because I took Plan B the week before I'm supposed to be getting it and it may delay it even more? I noticed that I've had some light brown discharge and I'm scared that it could be ""implantation bleeding"". Is there any chance I could be pregnant? "

Please someone help?,"I am 24 and a little concerned about some of the choices me and my bf have made these past 2 days. Me and my boyfriend have had sex the past 2 days. 1st time mid afternoon the day before yesterday 2nd time evening the day before yesterday and 3rd time last night about 12am. For all 3 times that we had sex 2 of those times we used protection & only one time (which was the evening the day before yesterday for like 30 seconds) during that specific 30 second sex act, I made him stop because we didn't have protection (Even though we didn't necessarily finish the act I still consider that to be sex because he entered me without a condom) the other 2 times we used a condom he would ejaculate inside me while wearing the condom which i have advised him on several occasions to stop doing that reason being because I do not want a situation where the condom breaks or the condom slips inside me and he actually ejaculate inside of me. The event that took place last night around 12am is the main reason I am writing this because even though we were using protection one of my fears happened. The condom slipped inside of me and he ejaculated in me (after finishing the sex act he said he thought the condom was inside of me and that he also ejaculated. I was instantly furious becausse i have told he to stop doing thay but he obviously doesnt listen). We proceed to look up places that would be open around 12:30am to get the plan b pill. I took it last night (about 1am). My last period ended 4 days ago and my next period will not be for another 19 days.

Im not sure how fertility and ovulation work but could someone explain to me the process using plan b on the first day of fertility and how effective it would be?

I want to know how badly she compromised our children with this behavior. I am enraged… but I’m putting that aside to focus on my children and how to safeguard their welfare going forward. We have two kids, age 3 and 5. During her first pregnancy, she went into pre-term labor at 27 weeks and remained on terbutaline and modified bed-rest until delivery at 38 weeks. Our child was extremely fussy and didn't sleep well for almost a year. He was nursed but needed supplemental formula. He has shown signs of aggression and ADHD and has been kicked out of his first daycare program. I am scheduling an evaluation for ADHD and other learning disabilities. Our second was born at 31 weeks and spent two weeks in the NICU. He has had follow-up visits for a murmur/hole in his heart (non-operative, we're waiting to see if it heals), for evaluation for being hydrocephalic, for asthma and a host of other maladies. My youngest has difficulty with language and is not an easy child to communicate with. I found the wife was taking the following drugs while pregnant: soma, adderall, vicodin, adrafinil (modafinil-provigil).  Herbal supplements: Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa), Phenibut, Sida Cordifolia, Kava Kava, Blue Lotus (nymphaea caerulea), Amantia muscari, Ilex Gauyusa, Silvia Divinorum, Hawaiian baby woodrose seed (Argyreia nervosa), Yan hu sou, Ma haung, Lion's tail/wild dagga (leonotis leonurus & leonotis nepetifolia), Kanna (Sceletium tortuosum), Syrian rue/Perganum harmala, Peruvian myrrh (commiphora myhrra), Turkhash resin incense w lettuce opium, Palo santo incense, Passion flower, Erythina mulungu, bellaco capsi Peru, Cielio banisteriopsis caapi vine… and others! Can someone help me figure what these drugs and supplements could have had for a negative effect on my children? Now that I know what’s happened I want to get my kids the best care available.  Thank you for your comments, resources, and support. Please do not respond with anger - I have more than enough of that right now! "

My first Depo injection was on 3/22/12. I am a health care professional, so my OB/GYN wrote me a prescription for the 150mg/ml prefilled syringes with three refills that would last until my next yearly exam. Initially I thought, ""Ok, the next shot needs to be in three months. There are 4 weeks in a month. So, in 12 weeks, I'll be due for another."" That date would be on 6/14/12. I cannot give myself the shot and I will be at work all day on 6/14. I do not want to ask the people I work with to give me the shot, so my boyfriend and I were discussing when he could give me the shot. He works on 6/15. After our scare we are both VERY careful about the whole birth control thing, so we are both concerned that waiting until 6/16 will basically be equivalent to not taking a few days worth of birth control pills (if we are going by MY ""12 weeks in 3 months"" theory). I called the pharmacy and she said I could take it a few days early, but she didn't sound too sure of herself. I started researching when to take it next on this website and the CDC's and have read the whole ""3 months,"" ""90 days or 13 weeks,"" and even read where it said to take your next dose at 14 weeks! I would like to know the timeframe that you all use; especially the ""pros"" out there that have had multiple injections and have had Depo be successful as a contraceptive! Thanks so much!! :) "

Question regarding limiting withdrawals and stopping?,"This is my first child and I know I need to stop my Tramadol for the baby. I've taken it for close to 5 years same dose, a little more(50mgs more) on bad days and do experience withdrawal symptoms when it's not taken. I won't see my OBGYN until I'm 8weeks on July 1st. I have weaned off Pristique(spelling? It's an antidepressant) before so I'm planning on applying that method to this. I tried lowering my dosage to 50 milligrams a night for a couple nights and that didn't work at all if last night is anything to go by. If I take 50 for a few more nights then alternate taking 50 one night and none the next for a few more do y'all think that will help elevate the withdrawal symptoms? I've read it has a antidepressant similarity. I haven't ever suffered seizures from not taking it for a couple nights just flu like symptoms and cold sweats and restlessness. It's been two nights I believe without Tram tonight would be my third. Would I be better off starting the one on one off tonight(take one tonight and not tomorrow night) or just go back to taking one a night for a few more nights? I'm sorry if this seems confusing I'm functioning on maybe two hours of sleep. Any advice is welcome. "

In June 2010 I had my new doctor remove the ""tangled"" IUD as it was causing me awful pains. He assured me that he could do it right & to get Mirena again, so I did. Long story short that tangled one was also removed & I against my better judgement had a 3rd IUD implanted. Which was MY biggest mistake. Third time was NOT the charm. In June 2011 I had my final IUD removed, after being sent to a bigger hospital an hour & a half from home to find & remove the IUD. Since then I have not been able to get pregnant. My doctor has assured me that he sees no tears or scaring. However now at 28 with a 4 year old we would love to have one more child.
