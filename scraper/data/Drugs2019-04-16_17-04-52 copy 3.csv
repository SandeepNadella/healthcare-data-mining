Then I was put on sertraline for 6 weeks. Sertraline did nothing for me either and my doctor changed my medicine to Venlaflaxin (I have heard that it is the same as Effexor)  I have been on 75 mg. Venlafaxine for 6 days and this morning I upped the dose to 150 mg. I still feel lost of anxiety, I'm shaking and my heart is beating fast. When I finally find a positiv thought it disappear just as fast as it came.  I'm so scared that this medicine won't work and I really need to hear some positive experiences.  Is it normal to feel more anxiety in the beginning and when will it start to work?  Please help me with some words of relief "

I had a seven day supply, one every 12 hours. This time the Pharmacy gave me Cefdinir by Aurobindo. Two days into the dosage, I began having upper abdominal pain. The third day the pain was so bad I had to go to my Urologist again. Since I had already taken Cefdinir by Teva with no problem, he and my Pharmacist suspected it was because of the Manufactor change. The capsules were darker in color, and I do have problems with dye. My doctor sent over a new prescription to my Pharmacist for the same drug but stressed it has to be by Teva. Now the Pharmacy can't get the Teva. Possibly it has been recalled. It's the Aurobindo that should be recalled. My problem is, with my only having one ""partial"" kidney left, and I am allergic to sulfa of any kind, Cipro, Arithamyacin (not sure of spelling here) and other ones that have dark dye format, and Amoxycillan does not touch my infections, even after a 10 day supply, plus it must be low dose, I am just waiting to see what they have decided to use. In my condition, I should not let this go. I took the Cefdinir by Aurobindo for 2 1/2 days, but I don't believe that was sufficient to clear up the infection. It has been 2 days since I have been off it, and the pain has receded a lot, but now I have a weekend to go through without an antibiotic. I tried myself to surf for antibiotics safe for me, but I am lost there. The Pharmacists says he is waiting for the doctor to call in something else, which probably won't happen now until Monday.

Social Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/lexapro-feelings-emptiness-3344957.html,Can Lexapro cause feelings of emptiness?,"Hi everyone. I deal with generalized anxiety with symptoms such as: ruminating thoughts, biting nails and nervous tics, social anxiety, aversion to leaving the house or answering phone calls, nervous sweating alongside hot flashes. My psychiatrist tried me on Paxil, then Prestiq, and now Lexapro.  I took the lowest 5 mg of Lexapro for a couple weeks and then moved up to 10 mg. I have now been on the 10 mg for about 6 weeks. My general anxiety has reduced and it has become easier to leave the house, answer the phone or talk to strangers without as much internal resistance. I also don't feel the need to work as much (which I'm not sure is a good thing or a bad thing since I own a business.) I do care more about cleaning my house and eating regular meals. Those are all positive effects. Neutral effects are that I continue to have nervous tics. The negative effects are bad dreams at night alongside strong feelings of ""I don't want to wake up"" in the morning. Also, I have a general sense of dis-contentedness and feeling lazy/unmotivated. Sometimes it even comes in a wave of existential despair that leaves pretty quickly, but most of the time it is just a general feeling of things being incomplete. I really don't know if I can live with that nagging feeling. I wanted to know if anyone else has experienced these feelings after being on Lexapro long enough to acclimate to the medication.  Any input would be greatly appreciated! "

Social Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/zoloft-anxiety-3267118.html,Zoloft doesn't seem to help anxiety..not sure what to do?,"Hi, I have an anxiety disorder and it has pretty much controlled my life for over a decade. I have times where it's okay, but lately for some unknown reasons it gotten pretty bad, where I just don't wanna go out and I feel pretty spacey and out of it. I also have a fear of medication, or rather the side effects.  Well I finally decided to get medication because I was at a point where I felt I had nothing to lose. I have a history of epilepsy which went away when I was 18, I'm 32 now. Some Meds have warnings that say if you have a history of epilepsy, that I shouldn't take those meds. So this also contributes to my fears of meds. Regardless, My Dr prescribed me Zoloft and I decided to take it.  I was on 25 mg for 3 months, obvs didn't do anything for anxiety, i found I was tired more, mood swings kinda disappeared, and I felt a little lazy. But otherwise no side effects so I decided to go up to 50 mg, which I've been on for a month now. My anxiety has gotten worse, I could probably sleep all day if I let myself, I've been getting headaches, I just haven't been feeling like myself., and have been feeling pretty uncomfortable. I kind of just want to hide inside.  My question is, is it unreasonable to expect results after only a month on 50 mg? People who have been on Zoloft have said they just woke up one morning and their anxiety was gone, so every morning I wake up hoping that today is that day. Because of the side effects I've had on 50 mg, I'm afraid to increase my dose. I don't know what to do, I have an appt with my Dr coming up and I don't know whether to increase my dosage or stop taking it "

At first I didn't know what they were so I just worked my way through them. I would go for months with no panic attacks and then I'd get sometimes 2-3 per day! I didn't know what was going on so I went to a doctor. He did all the tests and prescribed me with Xanax.  I read up on everything so while I did take 2 or 3 of these preferred not to because of the addictiveness of them. I found ""coping mechanisms"" to get me through the panic attacks - including jumping in a cold shower whether clothes were on or not! I went to doctors and cardio specialists to make sure it wasn't my heart - my heart is fine! So recently they started to get worse - and at no certain times. The only thing I could come up with that triggered them was the fear of having another one and the fact that I could always feel my heartbeat so when it sped up, I would freak out. I looked at my Xanax and they had expired so I went back to the doctor. He prescribed me Inderal 40. After the first few days it started to work great (couldn't feel my heartbeat all the time and felt more relaxed. I also felt that my memory was better) except that I started to have really vivid nightmares and when I woke up I could still feel them. So back to the doctor.  Now he's precribed me Zoloft.

I also suffer from general and social anxiety but for years I've just ""toughed it out"" and done my best to hide my attacks when around others. Last time I tried medication, I was on Paxil and it not only didn't change anything after a few months, the sexual side effects were too frustrating. My new doctor has convinced me to try Citalopram and I've been on it for a month now. I'm having the same sexual side effect issue as with the Paxil, but other than that the only thing I'm fairly certain about as a side effect is that it seems to be reducing the effectiveness of the Adderal. I'm having trouble concentrating, starting anything, finishing anything, etc. again. Some days I feel like I struggle even more than before either medication to convince myself to get anything done. I also seem to be tired a lot more.  So far I don't feel a reduction in anxiety though I was warned I might not for a while.

Acne,https://www.drugs.com/answers/accutane-rewiring-brain-3472973.html,Accutane “rewiring” the brain?,"Hi everyone.  My son took accutane for about 6 months on and off, as I had him stop it a few times when I noticed he was pulling away from friendships and isolating himself. The derm assured me that wasn’t from the med and my son always said he was not depressed when we talked although I thought he wasn’t acting right.  Fast forward to the end of the 6 months and it’s like he suddenly became 100% OCD. He wanted things washed all the nqtime, was overly concerned about germs andg finally admitted he’d been very depressed didn’t tell us for fear we would stop the med again - and he was so afraid his pimples would return if he stopped the med, he just figured he’d stick it out.  The issue I’m writing about is that even after we stopped the med, my former outgoing and all around happy kid, has intrusive thoughts telling him he can’t do anything right, he is very depressed, and has bright red hands from over washing. He even asked me to wash a bar of soap that fell into the shower one day.  It’s gotten so bad that now he can’t focus - and at our doctors recommendation, we’ve had to pull him from school. He has not been to school since Xmas as his dr had tried to find meds to help him with the OCD, intrusive thoughts and lack of focus but none of the SSRIs, SNRIs, or mood stabilizing meds she’s prescribed have helped. He has been with this dr for several years knew him before he started with these issues. She agrees this change came at the exact same time as when he took the accutane.  I am just so worried that he will never return to his old self. He’s been out of school for over a month and has no desire to see friends or do anything. All the things that were so unique to his personality are just gone. And sadly he wasn’t even this bad when he was on the accutane. It seems like he’s gotten worse since he went off it. Any similsr experiences? And if so, how did u reverse the effects of this drug to bring yourself or someone else back from the damage it’s done?! Thanks ! "

Vertigo,https://www.drugs.com/answers/remeron-clonazepam-2974732.html,Remeron and Clonazepam?,Developed vertigo in July and with that came extreme anxiety. I got the vertigo under control but the anxiety stayed. They tried me on Cipralex 5mg which after 4 pills I was a basket case. Switched me to Ativan which worked for a few months and then stopped. They then tried me on Wellbutrin 1.5 XL combined with the Ativan .5mg which I believe added to the anxiety but stuck with it for awhile. Took myself to ER after having severe panic attacked and they advised Ativan not working and to start the Clonazepam 1mg in am. and 1mg in p.m. They tried me on Zoloft 25mg even though years ago I had a severe reaction. Lasted taking 8 pills and then developed another severe reaction. I took myself of the Wellbutrin with Dr's ok and was given Remeron 15mg to use in p.m. and to continue with the Clonazepam as needed until the Remeron kicked in. They advised that I was the type of person that does not do well with medications and this would be the last med they would try. I have taken 4 Remeron pills so far and feel much better. Still a little tired and not quite cleared headed. Sleep not too bad. The anxiety is not as bad during the day time. Am cutting the Clonazepam to .5mg and sometimes need another .25mg. So does this show that the Remeron is starting to take effect and there is a light at the end of the tunnel. They say it takes 1-4 weeks to start noticing a difference?  Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!!

Today I just started my period as normal (every month it has been normal) My cramps were really hurting so I took 2 midol like I've done before. Then I started feeling tired so I went to a coffee shop right by my work so I could wake myself up before work. I work at a hospital as a Tray Passer. So I get there and I start to feel sick in my stomach. Very achy. And then I started feeling dizzy. I wasn't too concerned at first just thinking it was just me being tired so I went down to the cafeteria in a faster pace so I could get my heart pumping so I could wake up. I get a cart full of trays to take up and as I walked to the elevator I started feeling worse. Extremely worse. The more I moved, the more dizzy I got. Every tray I gave to the patients made me feel uncomfortable because I was scared I might faint and hurt a patient by dropping hot soup on them or something. So I head back down to the Cafeteria and tell my manager my concern. She says to sit for 15 minutes and see if it helps. So I got a glass of water and sat down for 15 minutes and got pretty emotional because I still felt so bad. It did help my dizziness but not my stomach. So I got back up and tried taking another cart. Started feeling horribly dizzy again. My anxiety grew because I was so scared I was going to hurt someone. So after I was done with that cart I went back down and told my manager I was going home and having someone drive me home so I wouldn't hurt anyone and just be safe. She said okay so I went home and my dad drove me. I am really concerned with what happened to me and how I can avoid it from happening again. I really wanted to work today so I could make more money. But I did not feel right and I felt like I was endangering people. What happened to me? "

Is this something that can be serious?,"Off and on for the past year or so I get these reoccurring dizzy spells. I feel slightly off balance, and just cannot seem to shake the feeling.

I have been taking Sprintec for about three years now. I was prescribed for the horrendous cystic acne I would get in high school, and the results I got were amazing. I am now 20, and about 8 months ago I began taking Lexapro (5mg and eventually 10mg). Three months into the Lexapro I began getting cystic-like pimples again. After months of trying to determine the cause, I am beginning to think that these pimples are hormonal. It's been three weeks since I've stopped taking 10 mg Lexapro, and although my pimples are not as cystic, there are still little tiny bumps around my face that won't seem to disappear. I am quite the perfectionist, so these pimples are driving me insane. Is it possible that my body no longer accepts the Sprintec, because my hormones are all out of wack from the Lexapro? Or will my hormones eventually return to normal with just the Sprintec, and not require a new birth control? I'm hoping that I am just being overly attentive, and that these acne flare ups will decrease as my body's hormone levels return to normal. Any form of advice or input would be greatly appreciated.

Urinary Tract Infection,https://www.drugs.com/answers/anyone-always-positive-urine-cultures-2818193.html,Does anyone else always have positive urine cultures?,"Last July I got my first UTI ever. I was prescribed Bactrim, it felt like it cleared up for a week, then came back again. I took Macrobid and still had symptoms (urgency), but my culture was clear. After a few weeks the urgency subsided. Approximately two months later, I felt the pressure and urgency of a UTI again. I was again prescribed Macrobid, and again my symptoms remained but my culture was clear. I was referred to a urologist who ordered a CAT scan. It showed I had a right ureteral stricture. I had a cystoscopy with stent placement and immediately felt relief when the stent was removed. For the first time in weeks, I had no urgency. That reprieve only last 2 weeks before I had urgency again. Positive urine culture. A renogram was ordered, which showed my ureter was still open and my kidneys were working perfectly. I was then prescribed the first of about a dozen antibiotics. I never felt any relief after taking them, though some days my symptoms were better than others.Every time I finished a round, I'd have a culture which was always positive for enterococcus. I started Vesicare in case I had overactive bladder in addition to relapsing recurrent UTI, and sometimes it seems to help a lot, and other days I have constant urgency. I've now been to THREE urologists. No one knows what's wrong. I've been taking an evening Macrobid for three months with no change to the cultures. They are always low level (10k-49k colonies per ml) and always enterococcus. I take a daily probiotic, Macrobid, Vesicare, D-Mannose, Monolaurin, Cranberry pill and Biofilm Defense. If I have a culure taken, even if I just finished a round of antibiotics the day before and faithfully take my Macrobid at night, it is always positive. I have been on Cipro, Keflex and Macrobid over and over again. Today the nurse at urologist #1 told me there as nothing they could do for me other than try a daily Bactrim (which urologist #3 said was ineffective towards enterococcus) or daily methenamine, which would turn elements of my urine into formaldehyde (and studies show is only occasionally effective). Then she actually said, ""You might just have this infection the rest of your life. That sometimes happens to women after they have kids.""  I just can't believe that! A constant and chronic infection is normal? I asked if I could try IV antibiotics, but she said my levels were too low. Of course they're low - I've been pumping my body full of antibiotics for months! Shouldn't they instead be asking how I can still be positive even though all my cultures say the bacteria is not antibiotic resistant? I'm at my wits end right now. My PCP is writing me a script for Cipro for 14 days because he took a culture the day before I went to see the specialist at the big university hospital that took forever to get an appt with - only to have them do a dip test and then not send it out for culture!!! And when I asked Uro #3 if I could go on something stronger than the Macrobid I'd already been on for 3 months, he said he wanted to save Cipro for when I had an infection - even after I very clearly told him that I ALWAYS have an infection (and then he still didn't get a culture)! I'm going crazy! I understand that I might have both chronic UTI and overactive bladder, but there's no way to know if my bladder spasms are a result of OAB if my cultures are never clear. ANY feedback at all would be helpful. Urologist #2 was quickly dismissed because he said my low level results just meant I was contaminating all my clean catch samples. There was no way I was contaminating all of them with the exact same bacteria every time! What do I do? I feel bad to complain because if I only had OAB, my symptoms would be more than tolerable, but it's the idea of the infection festering in me since winter that's driving me nuts. On top of everything, we were considering having another baby, but I don't think I should get pregnant with an active, chronic infection. "

I have always had really clear skin so I didn't think I would have to worry too much about acne as a side effect. For the first couple months I just experienced the usual spotting, cramping, and occasional pain during sex. After about 5 months, I stopped having periods although I would still get very intense cramps once a month. Around then I also started to notice problems with my skin. I used to have almost perfectly clear skin except for the occasional spot or two once a month, on my chin or around my nose or mouth. About 6 months after getting the Mirena, I started to get more spots, more frequently. I also started to get them in places where I never used to like my cheeks, jaw, neck, chest, and back. Now it is very rare for me to have less than 3 noticeable spots on my face, in addition to a bunch of smaller, less noticeable ones. I get cystic acne on my jawbone near my lymph nodes and I am starting to get what you would call backne. I never thought this could happen and I am amazed how much my skin has changed. Even areas that are not obviously breaking out seem red and rough. I am surprised it took so long for these side effects to kick in and that even almost a year later, they continue to get worse.

I read online about people who start clearing up on their 3rd month... while I am towards the end of my 4th month and its worse than ever. If my acne will ever start to clear up, when will that be? I have been feeling very depressed and exhausted over it. Also, what can I do to help the acne clear up? Are there certain types of food?  I just need to know when this will start working. "

I can go 24 hours without food and still won’t be hungry or have appetite… Now I don't know what to do. I need some meds cause it seems like I'm not able to live without it but I also don't want to go back to emotional emptiness & Zombieland. I haven't tried any combination of medications yet. All of them separately.  I tried: Venlafaxine - emotional blunting + severe weight loss. Fluoxetine - this was actually quite good. Gave me some emotional blunting, but only modest. I had to discontinue it due to suicidal ideation. Paroxetine - emotional blunting + horrible physical side effects. Citalopram - emotional blunting + absence of motivation. Sertraline - emotional blunting + absence of motivation. I'm starting to be really desperate and my doctor told me she don't want to treat me any more due to I'm not good patient and I'm not trying. I found a new psychiatrist and I will have a first appointment in 2 weeks but I don't know what to suggest to her. I was thinking about Wellbutrin but what I read it doesn't help with anxiety and weight gain. Has anybody some experience with a similar situation? Which antidepressant would be suitable for me? I don't know which one and I have the feeling that I'm starting to go out of options. If there is someone who had the same problem and found some solution: please write me :=) "

Social Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/difference-between-zoloft-lexapro-3379999.html,What is the difference between Zoloft & Lexapro?,"My daughter is 29 yrs old. She has been taking 10mgs/day of Lexapro for the passed 6 months. She has suffered from depression & anxiety most of her life but only started on medication recently because 9 months ago my mom, my daughter's grandmother, passed away very suddenly. My daughter was extremely close to her grandmother because, when she was a child, I was a single mom, working full time job that required a lot of travel. My daughter and I lived with my parents until I was 28 years old. At the age of 25, my daughter moved back in with her grandmother. Suffice to say, her grandmother was like a second mother to my daughter. So, the grief my daughter is going through is immense and constant. After her grandmother passed away, my daughter moved back in with me. Then, on Dec. 20th, 2017, my daughter went out to Nevada to visit our family. She is staying with my brother, sister & 19 yr old niece, who all live together. She was supposed to come home on Jan. 12th, but she didn't come back. Since my daughter has been out west, she recently ran out of her medication. I had her NJ Dr. call in a refill to a pharmacy in NV. However, because my daughter's only insurance is NJ Medicaid, the pharmacy in NV would not accept her insurance and wanted to charge over $300 for my daughter's Lexapro. We did not have the financial means to pay that price. So, against my wishes, my daughter started taking my niece's anti-depressant medication, Zoloft. When I researched Zoloft of Drugs.com, the dosage info stated that the MAX daily recommended dosage should not exceed 200 mgs/day. My niece's Zoloft is prescribed at 1,000 mgs/day!! One thousand mgs! That is 800 mgs over the recommended max dosage per Drugs.com. My daughter has been cutting the pills in half so she is only taking 500 mgs/day, but that is still 300 mgs more per day than the recommended max of 200 mgs. Since she's been taking the Zoloft, I have noticed an increase in my daughter's symptoms including, worsened depression, increased anxiety, severe mood swings (from crying to angry outbursts), thoughts of not living (not suicidal, but she talks often of ""not wanting to live anymore""). She also exhibits obsessive thoughts about money, anger towards her family & friends, and increased thoughts of her grandmother's loss. I am extremely worried about her right now. I know that she needs to get to a doctor asap. However, because the State of NV won't accept her insurance and I am unable to afford to pay for her appointment (I am currently unemployed with no income whatsoever), my daughter cannot get to a doctor until she gets back home to NJ. But, despite the misery she is in, my daughter says she's not sure if she's ""ready"" to come home. I am unable to distinguish how much of my daughter's increased symptoms are immense grief, how much is related to her current living situation and financial insecurity (my daughter always used to have a decent amount of $ in the bank, and her grandmother helped support her), so not having money is a major stressor for my daughter. However, she tells me that her anxiety about going on job interviews or even holding a job is too severe for her to go out and find a job that would earn her the money she urgently needs right now. She just can't seem to think clearly or make any healthy decisions. Fyi, I was able to get her doctor give me a new script, which I filled in NJ and am mailing out to my daughter tomorrow. In the meantime, please advise on: the exact differences between Lexapro 10 mgs & Zoloft 1,000 mgs, the possible dangers of the high dosage of Zoloft my niece & daughter are taking, whether or not it is safe for my daughter to stop the Zoloft immediately and resume her Lexapro as soon as she receives it, and how much time, if any, should we allow between her last dose of Zoloft before she can safely start her Lexapro again. Please, please respond to my question/message. I am deeply concerned for my daughter's safety and health. Thank you. "

Basically I can't eat when I'm anxious, in fact I sometimes dry heave, so I get anxious about being anxious when I am expected to eat, like going out for dinner, lunch, etc. Sometimes this spirals out of control and then I get anxious about every meal. This is where I'm at now so my Dr prescribed Paxil. It has made my symptoms worse, which I have read is common. I wasn't initially told this and I thought I was going crazy. I went back to the Dr and was given Ativan to help. I have been taking between 1-2mg of Ativan a day just to get by. I know the Paxil will take 4-6 weeks to work but I'm worried since my symptoms have increased it won't be as effective. I am waking up each morning very early (4.30am) incredibly anxious to the point I am dry heaving, even if I've had a good day prior. I am desperate for this morning anxiety to go away. Even if I have a nap, I wake up anxious. Obviously the ativan makes me drowsy so I'm napping a lot. I'm scared to fall asleep!

He was in ICU for about 5 days and then spent another 6 weeks in rehabilitation hospital. His main problem is he a smoker he said he was going to quit came home and started again. His health was doing good up until about a week ago. He started to get sinus congestion and then he started coughing a lot so it started going to his lungs. I had this weird feeling telling me to get him to the hospital because I didn't want something to happen again like before. That day he was admitted and then they determined he needed to be intubated, so they put him under with a 5mg Propfol drip. He was waking up a lot and gagging, they transferred him to ICU. In the ER he was started on a Levaquin antibiotic, in ICU they started with a Zosyn antibiotic and now have him on Vancomycin. They say he has a staph infection on the wound of his foot, MRSA and Pneumonia. Right now he is on 40% oxygen and CPAP at night. He is breathing on his own with the help of the ventilator. I visited him tonight and even on an Ativan drip he was able to wake up when the nurse said his children were there. I explained what was going on and to relax. He didn't seem anxious or agitated. His heart rate has been around 65-70bpm and stable, BP has been stable as well. He has Hypertension so they are giving him some Norvasc to keep it stable. Kidney and heart function is working great. It made me feel real good that he woke up and was able to comprehend what we were telling him, he was able to nod and and tried talking but with a tube down your throat that is not very possible. The nurse was pretty confident that he would be off the ventilator in a couple of days. She said tomorrow morning they are going to try and wean him off and see how he breathes on his own. Which is a good sign. Is there anything else they could be doing? Is this showing for a good outcome?

Sorry this is rather long.  I have had throat, sinus allergy problems all of my life some very severe, so I pretty well know how to treat them when a problem arises but this time nothing is working.. Five weeks ago I developed a very bad sore throat with flu like symptoms, I lost my voice for about 4 days.. My Doctor prescribed the Z Pack antibiotic, twice when I still had the flu symptoms for over 2 weeks, Started to feel better though very fatigued. I finished the second Z Pack, but my sore throat plus the aches and pains, chills, and sweats returned, also I developed a stiff neck, she prescribed Amoxicillin for strep and sinus infection. After 8 days taking Amoxicillin, I was feeling no better and was able to get an appointment with my ENT Dr. He said it wasn't strep told me to stop the Amoxicillin, he was more interested in my stiff neck than my sinuses or throat, prescribed Valium to relax the neck muscles. Advil for inflammation,wanted to prescribe prednisone for the sinuses but I have adverse effects from that.so he didn't. When I asked why the sweats, chills, weak feeling, he said I could have an infection in some other part of my body and that was it! I ordered Grossan Clear-ease and Breathe-ease having had good results from them in the past but my sinuses are still clogged, some ear discomfort and pressure around my eyes and nose, my throat is still sore though not quite as bad as it has been, I still get chills and sweats with a shaky, weak feeling all over, I have no temperature. I have no discharge from my nose at all, only lots of clear mucous in my throat usually after I use the Grossan products. I have avoided going to the ER having done so more times than I care to count only to have them treat me with the same antibiotics as above and receive a large bill! I've never had any upper or lower respiratory problem with the chills, fever and weakness last this long before. Has anyone out there experienced problems like this after the flu?

Symptoms went away so like many people I thought I was done with it completely. On Monday morning of the 12th of Dec. @ 8 am I took my last 5/325mg of Oxycodone. I went to my regular doctor that afternoon for the UTI but also to see if I could get a refill on my oxycodone. My doctor wouldn't refill it so he sent me to my pain management doctor. He wouldn't refill till my next appointment on wednesday, December 21st. So it was right after that walked out of his office that I decided that I would never again take another oxycodone because I want to be my normal self again. I suffer from major back pain so I also have Baclofen for muscle aches. These use to knock me out @ first but with what's going on those pills don't do anything for me. But I also had some Ambien @ home but only enough for 2 days. On Monday night I struggled to get to sleep but I know it wasn't much. If any 2 hours sleep maximum. On Tuesday I think that the last Ambien did work cause I woke up refreshed like as if it had been 8 hours sleep. Well, yesterday evening I noticed that I ached all over but much, much more in my lower back where my kidneys are. The pain is spread evenly from one side to the other. Well last night when I got off of work @ about 10:15 pm I went home really quick, put on my pajamas and drove down the street to the Hospital because to top everything all of I had been burning up with a fever earlier. I took an Ibprofen 800mg and seemed to have helped but by the time I was seen in the ER, my temperature had increased. I was prescribed more Ativan because the Dr. didnt want to give me more Ambien, and I was prescribed of course an Antibiotic for the Kidney infection that by now had developed. I didnt leave the ER till about 2 in the morning. Went down to 24 hr Walgreens to fill my prescriptions (which the pharmacist filled in less than 5 min, he was great) and I drove back home. While I was driving I took both medications because it takes a while to kick in (that's if it's going to work) and also because I live so close & I knew that it wouldn't cause me any harm. I got home filled the tub with hot water and soaked for about 20 minutes. Layed in bed and tossed and turned and tossed and turned. Finally when I was starting to dose off, the alarm rang. By now it was 4 am. I got up and got in the tub again. And if anything I took maybe a 30 min nap and thats kind of pushing it. So from when I woke up on Monday morning, I have not had a full 8 hours sleep this week. I hurt, im confused. Right now I cant really pinpoint what is happening to me. Does anybody have any idea when I might start to feel better and might be able to get some sleep? Since the baclofen and ativan obviously aren't working for me, I was wondering if it would be safe to purchase some Unisom? I am desperate and starting to feel a little depressed. If possible, somebody please help me. Im a single mother with two kids. a 14 yr old boy and 12 yr old girl. They have been amazing with me and helping to take care of me but they shouldn't have to take care of me I should be taking care of them. I am so, so, sorry that I made this so long its just as you can tell I am very, very confused. "

I personally believe people should try cognitive behavioral therapy and/or pychotherapy before taking any type of meds -this is comeing from some one who is going (not wanting to but GOING) to get his doctorate in psychiatry-. I think that people should do this because it has the highest chance of recovery and is suposed to be the prerequasit before medications (for people who actually know about psychology and psychiatry you should be trying to speak with the opposit form of therapy if the pt. lets you). there is no reason for people to think the placibo effect should be working since medications tend to cause a large amount of distress in people more so than they help (50% of people need medication AND therapy inorder to overcome their mental disorders) so trying psychology first is the best thing you can do.

Please help?,Been taking Adderall 6 to 8 months now. On one hand it's been extremely positive for me I was able to stop taking 4 medications lithium and prozac I had been on many years for debilitating depression and they really never worked. Latuda was the last prescription for bipolar disorder and then I was taking something for anxiety. Shortly after starting the Adderall I slowly came out of the debilitating depressive state that I had been in for the majority of the last 15 years. I have not experienced a severe or even mild episode of depression since. I do get sad and for a lack of a better word normal kind of sad something I'm able to manage and get over quickly. I never had any skin issues prior to taking Adderall. I had been on it when I was much younger but stopped taking it and a few years after I started abusing illegal substances and due to substance abuse issues I was denied when I asked to be put back on the medication. However while receiving substance abuse treatment the doctor thought it would be beneficial for me to go back on Adderall as they are learning that not everyone who has had substance abuse issues will automatically abuse the medication. I have not abused Adderall and I'm extremely happy with that overall impact it's had on my day-to-day life. However it's had a horrible impact on my skin it seems about 30 minutes after I take my dose regardless of the dose my skin secretes dirt and blackheads Non-Stop the only area of my body affected is from the chest up I barely touch my face and I can feel what's coming out of my pores and see it and I have become hyper focused on it it's causing a huge problem for me because I don't like it and I don't like the fact that my eyes have aged drastically in the short time I've been taking it again. I have been on an antibiotic specifically for acne and it has had no impact it has not helped one bit and I've been on it for about 4 months I have been using a peroxide cream and I think I'm over using that so I'm going to reduce how much I use that because it actually causes my skin to become even more oily. My problem is I'm seriously considering discontinuing use of Adderall and I'm afraid that I will fall back into that severely debilitating depressive state of mind I was in for so long I'm very scared of that. And it's not that Adderall makes me not depressed it's that I'm able to do things and I'm able to focus on things and that is what's impacted my depression for example I can clean my house and I don't Thirty-One room while trying to clean another by just moving things around and not really cleaning it not just one example I keep my appointments that's another example it's just had so many minor impacts overall when combined helps me get over the depressive state of mind I was in for so long. So I know that is not the pill making me happy. But it help me in ways I can't even understand and those changes in my day-to-day life is what help me get out of my depressive state and my living my life makes me happy. So I can have this horrible skin that makes me disgusted with myself but a better quality of life overall. Or I can go back to that severely debilitating depressive state again. Some people may think I'm shallow because I am considering stopping Adderall do to the skin issues and that my vanity is going to make me depressed but it's not like that I don't know how to really explain it but I need help because neither of those options are good for me. I have seen some of the skin issues commonly associated with Adderall and this issue and I'm experiencing doesn't fall under those categories. So I don't know what to do. Please help

The doctor asked what I thought was wrong and I told him I thought that I have a severe sinus infection. He asked if I was sure it wasn't strep throat because apparently that is going around. I said that I was not sure but my throat hurts the least of all and it doesn't hurt to swallow. He took a look at my throat for less than a second and then reported that he was right, I have strep throat. He then wrote me a prescription for amoxicillin. I asked him if that explained all the pain I was having and he said yes. The ears, nose, throat are all tied together. I didn't feel good about leaving with this diagnosis but could tell he was in a hurry. The whole visit with him lasted less than 2 minutes. I came home and read online that the more cold like symptoms you have the less likely it is to be strep and that taking antibiotics can sometimes worsen a sinus infection. I'm not sure what to do.

She said it may be cushings disease/ sydrome but other then my acne and the cortisol level being slightly high I have no other symptoms. In 6 weeks time I am having another blood test and having an ultrasound to check my kidneys. I was on the pill (qlaira) but have stopped taking it now as my Dr said that could be affecting my levels so she told me to stop it and go back in 6 weeks to be tested for cushings. I tried to find info on this on the net but couldn't find anything. When I went to have the test I fasted for 10hrs and had the test around 3pm but the nurse said I should have come in the morning to have the test done as they prefer to test the cortisol levels in the morning. The only reason I went in the afternoon was that I have a tendency to faint after a test and the only time someone could take me was in the afternoon.  Until 2 weeks ago my diet wasn't the best but now I am eating healthy and drinking a lot more water, I drank an unhealthy amount of diet coke (around 2L a day) for at least 10 years.

Basically my questions are 1. what's the odds of me having cushings? 2. could the pill affected my levels? 3. could my past of an unhealthy lifestyle still be clearing out of my system and affecting my levels? 4. could the fact that I'm just stressed affected my levels? 5. when is the best time to get my levels checked? I have been reading and they say you should get 2 tests done in the same day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon but my dr only gave me paper work for one. Any help would be great, I'm also a huge stresser when it comes to me possibly being sick so waiting these 6 weeks with all these questions is going to stress me out more. "

I was put on hormones around the same time as the Spiro (over 7 months ago) and ended up quitting the hormones a few months ago because of fatigue and that I felt light headed when exercising sometimes, but now I'm thinking it was the Spiro? I went to my primary care doctor to get checked and my blood pressure was low and I was asked if that was normal for me. I've had an EKG, Echocardiogram and lots of blood work done and no problems were found. I exercise and eat healthy. Besides the hair loss, could Spiro be the cause of how I've been feeling? "

Skin Rash,https://www.drugs.com/answers/lamictal-rash-3442729.html,Lamictal rash - can I still take it?,"Hello, I started Lamictal two weeks ago to treat Bipolar II. My doctor told me to start at 25mg for 2 weeks, 50mg for 2 weeks, 75mg for one week, and then 100mg. I did not heed his advice (stupid, I know) and instead went from 25mg for one week, 50mg for 5 days, and then 75 mg for the past two days. Today I broke out in a rash all over my body so I went to urgent care. They treated me, discharged me, and said I should be fine after a few days on steroids and Benadryl.  My main concern is that I won't be able to take Lamictal at all now. Do you think the rash happened because I dosed up too quickly? Or would I have broken out even if I dosed up slowly per doctor's orders? I guess I'm wondering if you get a rash from Lamictal, you'll get the rash no matter how slowly you ramp up. It would be really disheartening if I'm not able to Lamictal at all. I have been severely depressed for about three months (after having a hypomanic episode). During that time I can barely get out of bed, take care of my child, perform at work, eat or sleep. I've lost 15 pounds, which is a lot because I'm already a petite person.

I fell asleep EVERY DAY after taking PROZAC for 6 years AND JUST NOTICED! I was testing all my other RX's, Natural RX's and Vitamins. Missed the 1 that gave me the symptoms that I thought were all part of my Endocrine Dysfunction!. I'd take it at 8 a.m., fall asleep by 9 a.m. Took my pain meds at 5 to 6:00 a.m. so that's 2-3 hours in between - and I had them lowered before Prozac. I decided to take Prozac at night since it made me so tired. I did not take it that a.m. and I FELT WONDERFUL THE WHOLE DAY! At night a little dizziness. Then I made the mistake and took it - (Doc's Orders) and FELT SO SICK - but it was the SAME FEELING I'D HAD FOR YEARS! I had attributed it to my Endo problems. Not so! Then I read the side effects - EVERYTHING I HAD attributed to my thyroid, adrenal, endocrine problems were ALL LISTED UNDER SIDE EFFECTS OF PROZAC. Especially the fact that it affects your metabolism - which is what my poor little thyroid is trying to do. I am experiencing withdrawal - first week o.k., but can't sleep, crying, anxiety, even Xanax doesn't help. I don't know how long I can hang in there. My Endo would be very upset because #! rule for me is 0 STRESS! 3 months ago I had to stop taking cortisol cold turkey, then my narcotic pain meds got dropped in error-and my Endo wanted me back where I was for 4 years BUT I discovered the dropped amount worked almost as well, and my 3 day migraines disappeared! Now, I've stopped Prozac. My body can't take much more. I need to know how long it's going to take before I can sleep again! Or stop with the mood swings and all that goes with withdrawal. This is worse than going down on a narcotic. PLUS, I've tried all the SSRI's, most twice and SORRY DOCS BUT I WON'T BE TRYING THEM AGAIN. I get through this and I'm out of it forever. I found out because it made me so tired I'd fall asleep w/i an hour of taking it for 6 years. So I decided to take it at night. But that day was WONDROUS! I felt like my old self! Clear thinking, calm, collected - JUST FELT GREAT! Then I took it that night and was sicker than sick! I never touched it since. My husband called my Psychiatrist and told him what was going on - he deemed it inappropriate or whatever to return my call for discussion - so I'm on my own. My Endo would say I've WAY WAY OVERSTRESSED MY BODY. She was upset with the lowering of the pain meds and that was just about 2 months ago. I haven't quite recovered from that-but less is best. For Prozac and me - 0 is best. Anyone out there done this cold turkey? I REALLY WANT TO SLEEP! At least I have my appetite back! I recently had a bought with an abdominal/stomach issue or withdrawal symptom, but that's resolved itself. This is so much harder than even lowering narcotics - at least for me. And I just went down on 80 mgs./day of Opana - which is twice as strong as Oxycontin! And it's the Prozac leeching from my body that's making me feel horrific. WHEN DOES IT END? ANYONE???

I actually started spotting before it was time to take the ring officially out. Was this due to the ring being out all night? Or was this a crazy coincidence? If it is due to the ring being out all night do I use a brand new one the next day? Reinsert the one that was in? Or just let myself have a period? "

Sleep Disorders,https://www.drugs.com/answers/feeling-dream-awake-excessive-sleeping-3287643.html,"Feeling like in a dream while awake, Excessive sleeping?","At the moment I'm 23 years old. I've gone threw many of these episodes throughout my life, almost failing high school, to failing out of college, and losing multiple jobs.  My latest ""episode"" has been my scariest yet; I ended up going to the hospital twice for my symptoms, while on vacation.  It started last week with a common cold, once the cold ended I still felt stuck in a dream and periodically getting headaches. This ""dream like state"" is constant, it doesn't go away, and while typing this it is still happening.  But throughout the day the symptoms worsen and get terrifying. If I'm not in a bed I begin to feel like an intense dream like State almost as if I was dizzy and going to pass out , but I don't pass out, I can't pinpoint my symptoms when loved ones or doctors ask me all I can say is I feel like I'm in a dream. Everyone keeps telling me ""anexity"" but I'm feeling completely at ease right before the EXTREME symptoms begin.  I usually sleep 12+ hours daily. I can go threw days of sleeping 24 hours. The only way I can get myself to get up out of bed is taking Adderall. Without that I can keep sleeping.  Alarms don't wake me up, I can't keep food near me while asleep because I will sleep eat, without the adderall I only wake up to use the bathroom and eat. I don't take it daily only days I need to wake up to accomplish something.  The dream like feeling isn't as common, it has only happened 3 times since December since I've been keeping track. But this is the most terrifying one.  Day time and Lights really seem to exaggerate the issues, and the longer I'm awake the most my brain doesn't feel normal, I go into state where I feel like I'm almost asleep while awake and it triggers a panic attack. I can become very child like as well.  From childhood I've had issues with excessive sleep and if anyone would try and wake me I'd become very nasty but have very little recollection of being so mean then fall back asleep. From my 12+ hours of sleep I have struggled with having my sleep pattern being normal . I tend to revert to sleeping in the day and being awake at night. I feel my most wakeful around 3am to 7am . I have only a hand full of times where I can say I've woken up rested and I can remember each time.  My memory is horrible. My friends or family will bring up experiences or vacations and I have very little to no recollection of them, and it's very upsetting. Pictures can sometimes trigger the memories.  Right now for about a week I've felt like I've been in a complete De ja Vu state. Being forced to be awake because I went on a mini vacation, I got home yesterday and slept 22 hours. I was hoping being home would relax these symptoms, but I'm at a loss. I'm completely exhausted and terrified.  I feel as if overstimulation exacerbates the dream like state; or possibly it's when I'm already overly exhausted.  Adderall keeps me up but it doesn't make me feel awake, I still want to sleep and have no energy.  I've tried anti depressants as well and it doesn't change much. They gave me the adderall at 17 thinking i wasn't able to constrate because of ADD I'm sorry my thoughts are so erratic but I'm not feeling myself. I do have C5 right sided nerve damage and c3-c4 disc buldge but that's more recent, im just wondering if that cud possibly be effecting this dream like state. "

I do not feel like it helped my depression much at all. I could not get a good nights sleep, tossed and turned all night, and was told I needed a sleep study. Of course, they said I had apnea and needed a C-Pap machine. I constantly had some kind of skin issue, first acne and rosacea on my face then a rash on my neck, chest and arms. The dermatologist said it was photo-sensitivity to the sun and they told me to stay out of the sun and sold me some really expensive sun screen powder stuff! I also had back and neck pain all the time. In 9 month time have racked up a chiropractor bill of over $800 (our insurance does not pay well for chiropractic care). I had back spasms or ribs slipped out constantly. (I think my chiropractor thought I was being pushed around or beaten by my spouse!) When I would get out of bed in the morning my whole body ached and all I wanted to do was stay in bed. I also developed Plantar Faciitis and I am convinced that was a result of my back and muscle issues going on. I started feeling like I didn't want to see people, I had a hard time going to work. Even though I would say that I was never suicidal, one morning on my way to work I thought to myself ""if I just drive into the ditch, I won't have to go to work"". In general, I think I felt worse the last 9 months than I ever have. I have since switched to Effexor XR and feel completely different. I have not had any back pain, muscle spasms, or aches.

Seroquell still works in high doses but I don't like the effect. It also gives me such a dry mouth and stuffy nose that it keeps me awake.

Sleep Disorders,https://www.drugs.com/answers/i-need-info-on-trazodone-483036.html,I Need info on Trazodone?,"I have a very real anxiety disorder. I say that because a top notch psychiatrist dx me with GAD. I already knew I had it but it was nice to know he confirmed it. But what I don't have is a doc who is willing to treat it with Benzos, which is the only meds that really work. I've tried Buspar and even very low doses of Zyprexa, all to no avail. So out of sheer desperation I started taking some Trazodone I have for sleep. I stared out with about 25 mg a day and after 2 weeks I was up to 50 mg. Oh btw, it stopped putting me to sleep. So in an effort to get the sleepiness again, I upped the dose to 50 mg 2 times in the evening. I guess I'm doing this much about 1 week, and now I think I'm feeling excessive anxiety from not taking it. In other words a withdrawal symptom. Can this be, does anyone know? I am aware that originally Trazodone was called Desyrel and was an anti depressant med. I never liked it much so I didn't use it. But back then I had a doc who was giving me Valium and Trazodone and Valium didn't seem like a good mix. I no longer get Valium and that's fine because I found out Valium causes depression. I now prefer Ativan, Xanax or Klonopin. Klonopin is the least effective but it beats sitting here feeling like I swallowed a jar of Mexican jumping beans. I have never been addicted to Benzos nor have I ever felt a high from them. When I have Xanax or Ativan I usually take 0.5 mg at a time and usually only 3 times in a week. I am very careful to not develop a dependency for it. But in this regard my doc is a jerk because he won't give it to me. And I lack the funds to go looking for a doc who will treat my anxiety. It's sad too, because I know quite a few people here who also need Benzos for anxiety and you have a sympathetic doc.  So here I am today at only 2 pm and I feel like I Need Trazodone already. I never took Trazodone every night before for more than 3 nights in a row. Now I've taken it nightly for over a month. Can I have developed a tolerance for it and now I need it to feel normal already? I didn't know Trazodone can even do that. If it can do that what makes the docs think it's any better than a Benzo. Especially since Benzos are much more effective on my anxiety. So is all this real, or my imagination? Opinions please. "

One of those is for my slightly high bp. but my god look at all of those meds. My life has been ruined by the adhd since when I was young they didnt have adhd - in the 3rd grade my parents took me to a child psychiatrist who said I was hyperactive..I would have ""episodes"" of so much energy that I begged my parents to kill me. Recently I had a 4 day no sleep episode(theyre usually only 2 day's) - I called my doctor to see about getting some triazolam since it use to work fairly well. She told me that I should go to the hospital since she has been trying to help me with this for 6 years. I went and while talking to the receptionist I said ""i havent slept in 4 days and I was so miserable I'd rather be dead"". (Its just a manor of speaking, I wasnt seriously wishing to be dead)..anyway - they took me to an in patient mental hospital with guards! I was there for a week, seeing a psychiatrist. I told him that I really just can never sleep. He gave me ambien, which totally did nothing for me. So he added ?? trazadone?? I think it was called to help the ambien ""kick in"". It was a dud. Here is the big question... is there anything that in ONE pill that can keep me calmed down during the day. ANd a sleeping pill that is a guaranteed sleep?

Does anyone take it for sleep and anxiety? My doc is considering either lowering my Zoloft and upping the trazadone a bit or just using trazadone for sleep and anxiety. Anyone just using trazadone?

I couldn't stop thinking about it, i couldn't sleep, I'd be up all night screaming and worrying so I turned to my old friend Ativan and started taking 1 mg a night to sleep. I've had moderate anxiety for over 20 years and took an Ativan once in a blue moon when needed. I used to think Ativan was harmless until I started searching ototoxic drugs and came across a post about benzo withdrawals. Well it freaked me out so bad that I want to stop taking Ativan, I talked to a psychiatrist about it and he laughed at me saying 1mg a night for a guy my size is nothing, its like a glass of wine. Well that was 3 weeks ago which would've been the ideal time to stop instead I listened and got another prescription from my doctor. My doctor did express concern but said I should talk to my psychologist once she comes back from vacation about tapering off which I will do. I have a lot of concerns about this 1) it will increase my tinnitus which will drive me insane 2) I am totally scared of the withdrawal symptoms I am hearing. Last night I decided to start weening off the drug but based on the dosage I was taking there is no instructions for weening off 1 mg of Ativan so I cut one of my .5 pills in half and took .75 last night. I had some vivid dreams but nothing scary but my legs felt and still feel like they sweaty and on fire. I'm a bit concerned about not knowing how to taper properly and not knowing the warning signs.

I did not sleep last night because of anxiety and took my vyvanse anyways because I knew I wasn't going to sleep. It's wearing off now, and the mix of not eating, not sleeping, and coming off of vyvanse made me irritated so I chewed on a few lemon balm leaves. I got pretty relaxed and then a sudden sharp pressure came into the right side of my chest and right shoulder. But the thing is, this happens a majority of the time I'm coming off of vyvanse, no matter if I slept or eat.

I get it suddenly and don't know what to attribute this to. My heart race is also usually increased when this happens. My heart rate has been increased the last 2 times I went to the dr, but I drank coffee right before both those times. So heart issues caused by vyvanse or maybe anxiety?

Really sucks b/c I deal with people all day and I have to be on my game. About 6 months ago a friend of mine suggested I try a few of his Klonopins he was perscribed to help since he wasn't using them anymore. I tried them and it was magic. I had never slept so well and woke up so refreshed. So he gave me the rest of his... I took one 2 mg pill just at night before bed and did not abuse them. So 2mg klonopin for about 6 months. I thought this drug is nothing serious no big deal and its making me much more productive in my life. Well after a while I started looking into the drug and realized how serious it could be if taken for a prolonged period. I decided to just stop taking it... cold turkey. I've never had an addictive personality and never been addicted to anything even remotely in my life. Big f'ing mistake. For 4 days it was literally hell on Earth and I had no idea why! My heart beat was out of this world, i couldn't talk to people without unbelievable selfconciousness, i woke up 5-6 times a night, it was like a 4 day panic attack. surely it wasn't the klonopin i must be sick or something.

Well i'm mid-schedule and I'm starting to struggle. Rapid heart beat (i've never noticed my heart more in my life), uncomfortable in social situations, i find myself constantly thinking about what i should say or do, very very self-concious in other words.

Any advice on what other natural methods people use? I work out in the morning and work all day. I am not sure I will go to work tomorrow since I may be up all night. I hear its hard to stop taking this drug. I hear that all the side effects though will go away after it gets out of your system. I have not set a ""cold turkey quitting"" timeline, yet am doing it gradually. I found that I was stock piling up ambien - probably had about 400 pills - so I would always have them and (so I thought) never have sleep issues again. I flushed all but 20. I am ready to make a change. I think to myself - I used to sleep like a normal person, lay my head down on the pillow and be out. What happened to that? Ambien. You go a couple of days without sleep and you think the world is going to end. Ambien helps with that but I will say for me, I am addicted. I think its possible to gain that natural sleep cycle back without being on a substance and am more than willing to try.

What can I expect with procedure? My story thus far: I have hyperthyroidism (level is .03), and discovered my thyroid had substantially grown and needed removal August 2013 (went to see ENT about something else and asked him about it). I had my surgery scheduled swiftly for Aug. 28th, it was canceled a week out because the surgeon-1 cut his hand. He passed me on to a more experienced surgeon-2 at Stanford (also person who taught him surgery). I am thankful for his unfortunate situation, my current surgeon-2 is less urgent in removing it, and wants to run more tests to rule cancer out (he happens to specialize in cancer and works out of cancer center). Surgeon-2 had a difference of opinion in may aspects of my care, from the size of cut to potentially keeping me sedated overnight due to swelling in area. Surgeon-2 even disagreed with the radiologist (diff. hospital) who reviewed my MRI that was ordered from Suregon-1. My thyroid is supposedly wrapping around my windpipe up to the right. Suregeon-2 thought it had not wrapped around yet, he is having his radiologist review it himself. The original surgeon told me he would not biopsy my thyroid because he is removing it, and that's basically pointless and would test it following the removal. Following an ultrasound test to rule out cancer, which surgeon-1 never did, Surgeon-2 ordered a biopsy because they found a second nodule on my right thyroid. The radiologist suggested that I get biopsy procedure. I just became aware of this 2nd nodule today, and my last ultrasound two years ago showed no signs of a 2nd nodule. Nor was I told about a 2nd nodule from Suregon-1 following my MRI. My Questions/Concerns: I was wondering should I take the day off from work? The nurse said I probably would need someone to drive me to appointment due to numbing meds. Did anyone drive themselves home, I have no one t I read some of you opted out of pain meds, why would people opt for no pain medicine?  I have a high tolerance for pain , but thought of being repeatedly pocked with a needle in two places in my neck is unsettling. And some reviews have had it was extremely painful, while others thought it was a walk in the park. I guess the size and depth of thyroid may be the reason for the difference of opinions.  Also, if it were cancer, would pocking cancerous cells and exposing it to my neck area be the best thing to do? I feel like it would spread any cancerous cells to my neck. I have to wait til next month for an appointment for my biopsy because they are booked up this month, and not scheduling for November until the last week of October. So many ups and downs, I should have had surgery August 28th, but all things are on His time and I remain faithful that I will be fine. Thanks in advance for your responses. Tracy "

I would speak and by the time I got to the end of a sentence, I would forget how the sentence started and what I was talking about. I was literally freaking out. So I sat at my desk, laid low, drank as much water as I could, and ate two granola bars + one protein bar.

So, I've completed a sleep study, and apparently it'll take up to two weeks before I get any results in. I have severe day time sleepiness, probably for the most part induced by the series of depressant medications that I take: 30mg Methadone, 3mg Klonopin, 300mg Tramadol, 100mg Pristiq, 8mg??? Minipress, 2mg Abilify (taken as needed), and 225mg Lyrica. I take these for fibro, anxiety (general, panic, and social), depression, SAD, and C-PTSD. I take 250mg of Nuvigil, and it just barely works for me durring the daytime. At night (past 8:00pm), not really. My question is, I know that the meds play a major role in all of this, however, when I fall asleep, the moment that I close my eyes, I'm out. I lay on my back, and don't more for the full 7.5 hours, according to my wife and the study. I also randomly fall asleep in the evening in the middle of doing tasks, only to wake up and find that I have been out for over an hour. I also get very week durring stressful events, have to sit down, and close my eyes. Without the Nuvigil, I'd fall asleep randomly durring the day with little or no warning. Do you think that it's Narcolepsy intensified by the meds, something else, or just a result of all the meds (which are going to be decreased and modified very very soon)? I'm curious to hear your opinions! "

Its not just at night, its there always! I've been having trouble going to sleep anyway, but some of the other symptoms of the withdrawal are starting to improve. I've been taking about 1 mg of xanax - half in the am and the other half at night, that helps with the elephant on my chest feeling, and my throat feels so weird, I'm having trouble swallowing, I have to make myself put food in my mouth and just swallow it, nausea some but xanax is helping with that. I have been through treatment before, in patient and many other times have been through withdrawals, I pray this is my last time! Who wants to put their body through all this? Of course, sometimes we screw up - shit happens, I'm just trying to move forward with this and I'm trying to stay positive, but I am alone in this and it is hard! I'm rambling again - anyway, since I have no one to talk to this is where all my thoughts have to spill out I guess! Ive been making myself walk a little every day. Everything is SUCH A HUGE EFFORT!

I took the ibuprofen originally for some muscular aches and pains I experienced one day after working in the yard. I have been taking it since and find no more nightmares occur. My doctor cannot explain it but suggests that I never take the bupropion and ibuprofen within 8 hours of each other due to side effects.

I have always dealt with what I will call “manageable anxiety.” However, Recently I had two big life changing events that caused my anxiety to become out of control. I started to not sleep, anxiety attacks, constant worrying about anything and everything. So I went to my family physician who immediately put me on 20 mg of Prozac, which I took for exactly 2 weeks. At my follow up appointment it was decided the Prozac wasn’t working for me so he decided to switch me to 10 mg Lexapro (generic) I’ve been on the 10 mg Lexapro for 7 days now and one of the worst side effects I’ve had is this strange depressed feeling that I did not have before. I have no motivation or interest in the things I once had. I loved my job before and now struggle every day to get through. I’ve also had the usual side effects as well, heightened anxiety, insomnia. I can’t take it anymore. I want my old mind back.  I want to quit taking the Lexapro and try to manage my anxiety myself and stop the sudden depression.  Now what I’m worried about is the withdrawals I may have... since I was on prozac two weeks and one week on lexapro. Both are SSRI so is it like I’ve been on them 3 weeks?  From what I understand the withdrawals from these meds is very extreme.  Thank you for any advice. "

Sleep Disorders,https://www.drugs.com/answers/what-happened-to-me-horrible-experience-er-trip-440223.html,"What happened to me? Horrible experience & ER trip, Seroquel & Low K+ (Potassium)?","I am prescribed 300-600 mg Seroquel PRN for sleep. I am also prescribed 100mg PRN up to 3x a day for anxiety. Tuesday night instead of taking 2x 300mg I took 6x100mg. I am very certain that I took 6 and only 6 as I remember counting them twice. I stayed downstairs until I started to feel uncomfortable then I went upstairs to bed. Once in bed I started hallucinating, my chest began to hurt and my heart began to race. I felt like if I were to not keep a conscious effort to breathe that I would stop breathing. I (then) thought that there has got to be a difference between the 100mg pills and 300mg pills and that they have to be like time-released differently or something so I got up, went to to sofa outside my husband's office, tried my best to explain this, and told him to the best of my ability to call poison control and ask them if there was a difference between the two pills that would explain why I was reacting this way. Things went downhill really quickly from there and ended up with my husband driving me to the ER, Poison Control called them in advance to tell them I was coming. Apparently my husband and poison control thought it might have been possible that I either took the wrong medication, or took too many, or both, because they didn't really trust that someone exhibiting the symptoms that I was having could have really just taken the correct dose of the correct medication. At the ER in triage my heart rate was 145 and that was actually better than it was at home. My blood pressure was bad too but I don't remember what it was. Anyway I peed in a cup then they took me right back and a doctor and 3 nurses were all over me even as I was undressing... The doctor was very skeptical of what I was saying, he said Poison Control and my husband both told him it was possible that I could have taken an overdose and I tried to explain that it was not possible. Having a history of two prior intentional overdoses probably didn't help me out in this case, but those OD's were serious though; and without a doubt deliberately intentional and meant to end my life. At any rate they drew my blood and started an IV, and wanted me to drink the activated charcoal (which I have never had to do before). I tasted the stuff, and I probably would have appeased them if it wasn't flavored and sweetened, but as it was - no way! Plus with my medical background, I knew that I didn't have anything in my system that needed to be neutralized... because *I KNEW* that I had taken the correct dose of the correct med, and I wasn't drinking that stuff just because everyone else didn't trust me. At any rate, my blood and urine came back clean, which I knew it would. However my potassium was 2.7 and they gave me some pills, which I took. I was feeling better at this point and I just wanted to go home and sleep, about 3 hours had passed by now, maybe 4 (I think I slept through some of it). I want to know what the hell happened. I have taken 1200 mg Seroquel, taking 12x 100mg pills on 2 or 3 seperate occasions, just to mentally check out (the last time was back in February of this year) and that didn't cause anything like this! in fact somebody called 911 on me back in February even though I told them I was just fine, and I sat out in my backyard and waited for everybody to get there. The EMT's took my vitals, I was fine. It was also quite easy to convince the EMT's that I was not trying to hurt or kill myself, since I wasn't. At any rate. What the heck happened? I hadn't been drinking. I am not on any new meds. I have done a lot of stupid things with a lot of different drugs. I have felt really shitty from taking an overdose of a drug, but I have stayed OK and ridden it out. But this time I was fairly convinced I was going to die. And I didn't even misuse anything. "

I was taking 200mg at night (mainly for sleep) and sometimes, I'd take up to 300mg. I had been at this dose for about 2.5 years, but it was wreaking havoc on my life. I had packed on over 50+ pounds, I'd sleep for days at a time, I had no energy or willpower to do anything, and I'd eat everything under the sun (of course, about 45 minutes after taking it). I've now titrated down to 25mg, and in a week - I'll be off of it completely. However, I've noticed that during this past month or so, I have been extremely lethargic (physically) every single day. I just feel zapped of all energy. My mind is in the right place, I've lost 12 pounds, and I've been averaging around 7.5 hours of sleep for nearly 2 months. Oh, and did I mention that I also take the maximum dosage of Dexedrine (psychostimulant) along with Wellbutrin (which, combined with Dexedrine, is considered to be a major contraindication - since it supposedly elevates the amount of dextroamphetamine in the blood). I exercise daily, and eat better than ever before - and yet, the only change I've made is to practically all but eliminate a medication that is a dopamine agonist, and an anticholinergic (among others).

Anytime he fingers me or he goes down on me afterwards it starts to itch all around my vagina and near my clit and it will stay like that for a week! After the itching begins I'll start to notice the white discharge that looks like cottage cheese. Which has led me to believe it's a yeast infection. This has happened more than once and ALWAYS happens after sexual activity with my boyfriend. I've been researching this but I've come up with no answers. The only thing that stops it is when I stop sexual activity with him. But the second we start again it happens. I think I've narrowed it down to clitoral stimulation but I'm not sure! Tonight we tried it again after two weeks of absolutely nothing and I had to stop him because my clit started to her soooo bad. What could be happening? I've been taking cranberry pills to help with the yeast infections (which hopefully I'm correctly assuming it's a yeast infection all of my symptoms seem to be pointing to that) that I had previously been getting. Could over stimulation on my clit be causing this? I'm still a virgin so I know I don't have any STD's and he's been tested so he doesn't either. I know it's not herpes. Plus neither of us have any bumps for it to even be that. Please help! This happening had really put me off wanting to have sex and I want to feel pleasure instead of pain! And I don't want to go to the doctor until I know for sure it's something that either one of us are doing and it can be avoided in the future!

Smoking,https://www.drugs.com/answers/wellbutrin-effects-personal-level-you-felt-527789.html,Wellbutrin - I am looking for more of the effects on a personal level. How “you felt”?,"I started taking Adderall 20mg and then moved on to 30mg. I started smoking again, so I decided to visit my doctor to see if there was anything I could do to quit. We both decided that Wellbutrin was probably the best way to go considering my ADD (WB helps with this) and smoking (I've been trying to quit smoking for a while now). A lot of the reason it has been hard for me to quit is because I get really depressed. I'm not suicidal, but I get to the point of not caring about anything and I usually shut myself off in seclusion. I never seem to get depressed about any one thing. I will wake up and just fall into a dark hole. I started this medicine originally for smoking but I really wanted something more out of it. I want to feel alive. I've been taking it for 5 days now. I feel very focused and happy with the Adderall but other than that there's no difference so far. I've read that there's a side effect period that I have to go through before I start to feel the positive effects of Wellbutrin. I've also read that it takes about 4 to 6 weeks to feel any difference in a positive mood. I’m not really depressed right now, mostly because I’ve kept busy. I've recently dropped all of my friends (defense mechanism that I have). Although this does sound like a negative state of mind, I have been able to focus on school and work, and have made a huge difference in progress (that, and I see nothing positive in the way that the people around me make me feel). I’ve even shut off my phone and deleted my Facebook. I want to be alone and focus on me, unlike other times where I would be alone to focus on others... If that makes any sense. Anyways, I guess that was supposed to be a little insight of how I got to this point of taking Wellbutrin. My question is, if this medication were to work, how would it affect me positively? How did it affect you? What side effects did you acquire? How do I know if it's working/not working? I do not have many friends and the ones I do have, I am very close too. This is for the most part because I keep to myself, unless I am very close to someone, or I will push them away before they get to close. Did Wellbutrin help you with any aspect of your social life in maintaining a relationship (of any type)? This is my first anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medicine (I guess that is what it is considered). I would love some input for those who would love to share. I know that some are going to say, “Talk to your physician”, but I am looking for more of the effects on a personal level. How “you felt”, not the warnings on the back of a label. I am a 27 year old man, good looking and I stay in pretty good shape. I exercise and eat healthy regularly. I am a hard worker, smart and have dreams that I would really like to accomplish... but I'm not happy nor do I feel the least bit normal and I'm afraid that this day by day feeling will cripple that. --I wish I did.

Social Anxiety Disorder,https://www.drugs.com/answers/psychiatrist-prescribe-benzos-3471827.html,Psychiatrist won’t prescribe benzos. What now?,"I’ve struggled with really bad anxiety my whole life. I’ve been diagnosed with GAD with panic attacks, social anxiety disorder, depression, ADD. I also have un-diagnosed PTSD from a rather recent event that’s happened to me which interferes badly with my sleeping (difficulty falling asleep many nights, and waking up easily in panic from noises). This is a list of everything that has been prescribed to me before that has failed to treat depression and anxiety: Zoloft, Lexapro, Prozac, Risperdal, Zyprexa, Seroquel, Trazodone. I’m currently on a moderate to high dose of Effexor which hasn’t helped me either, but my psychiatrist keeps raising the dose since I’m having no side bad side effects. About a year ago I had a psychiatrist in a different state that prescribed me 0.5mg Klonopin twice daily as needed, which helped with general anxiety, but later I switched to Ativan .25mg as needed, because it helped me sleep better and worked better for panic for me, which was also a problem back then even before my PTSD incident. However, now I have a different psychiatrist that says he will not prescribe benzos, even despite my current symptoms and history of them being the most useful medications for my terrible anxiety in my experience.   So my question is, what more could I tell my psychiatrist to help him understand my situation, or what other suggestions medication-wise would you have for me to ask about?  Many things have been tested on me and have failed and at this point I really feel like a guinea pig. I do understand the potential negatives of benzodiazepines such as dependency over extended use, but I do believe sometimes the benefits outweigh the negatives when it comes to medication, plus it is not something I would take every single day, only the handful of nights I cannot sleep and lay in my bed in fear for no reason. I will say again that I AM open to alternative suggestions, so don’t try to deem me as some sort of drug-seeker. I don’t feel some sort of “high” when I take anti-anxiety medicine, I feel normal like I would feel if I didn't have anxiety (with a little tiredness in top) and able to relax. I just had to include that because it’s a natural instinct for some to assume that at first glance when they see questions like this, which I do get. In case you would like a little more background info on my current situation, here's the deal: I am 19, 3-4 months ago i got robbed and carjacked with a gun to my back. That didn't help my anxiety much, many nights I have trouble sleeping and I often wake up in the middle of the night after hearing sounds that make me suddenly awake in panic. By day I have really bad anxiety as well that truly prevents me from achieving my full potential, I struggle with work and school. Speaking of work I’ve pretty much been out of work since that carjacking incident I mentioned, partly from ridiculous fear, and partly because I can’t even hold the same sleep schedule every day with these PTSD-like symptoms at night. As for school, I am graduated from high school as of last year, which I had really bad panic attacks at the end of senior year and I had to finish my classes online because my anxiety got so bad. Now I don’t feel comfortable starting college classes yet until my anxiety and add are under control, because I really do want to do well and not just waste my time. So since I’m not in class yet I’ve been just doing my best at trying to get my problems under control.  Anyways sorry for the cluttered rambling mess haha, any advice is appreciated. "

My yeast infection causes my clitoris to be hypersensitive and makes me feel like I need to urinate all the time. I started use gyno-daktarin cream which got rid of the itchiness and and the burning. However the clitoral discomfort and urgency to pee did not go away. I still show external symptoms of a yeast infection when I look down there too. So my doctor prescribed a single dose of fluconazole for me. I took it 28 hours ago. I took the capsule at 9pm the day I was prescribed the drug. The next morning I felt much better. My clitoris still felt a little sensitive, but less than before. And the urgency to pee was barely there. I ate cheesecake then took a nap that day for about 2 hours and woke up. When I woke up my clitoris felt more sensitive again (but not as bad as before I took fluconazole) and the urgency to urinate also feels worse (but not as bad as before I took fluconazole). I am worried that eating the cheesecake might have hindered the fluconazole from working since it contains dairy, and I read that taking dairy can inhibit the absorption of the drug. But I only ate 3 very small slices and I haven't taken in any other dairy containing food today. And I took probiotic vitamins as well. I would like to know if anyone has had a similar experience with fluconazole and how it ended? How long does it take typically for single dose fluconazole to work?

A week after surgery I was able to cut with a knife, squeeze a ball or write out my checks (when paying bills). But now I can't even hold a pen, let alone squeeze anything or make a fist. My fingers are so swollen they can't bend! My shoulder seems to be healing nicely. But I do have neck issues, too, so I'm wondering if that's contributing to the swelling or if the hand swelling is just from the fluid from the surgery. Don't know if the exercises are helping or irritating it. Tried elevating it, icing it, soaking in epsom salt baths, etc. But nothing seems to help. Any other suggestions would be appreciated. But mostly I'd love to hear from someone whose actually experienced this and has recovered from it, as I'm dying to know ""how long"" it took for the swelling to go down and what they found helped reduce the swelling - or was it just ""time""?

Of course he had started school, so we put pads in his underwear, and kept extra clothes and underwear at school and would go by daily at lunch to make sure he hadnt leaked stool that day yet. But for the past 5 years it has been a constant struggle. I talked to his surgeon and all he could and has EVER told me was to give him Miralax every day. All that did and does is cause very loose stool everyday, in my opinion it has made it worse. We took him back to a diffrent Dr that ""specializes"" in that sort of thing, and he told us to double the dose of Miralax (which made 2 capfuls twice a day) what an idiot. Of course tried that, it was awful. So needless to say I have done research for the past 3 years, and have come up with nothing. I have tried high fiber foods, culturelle, coalce... The problem is if i dont give him Miralax, he gets impacted stool, if i give him Miralax its too runny and leaks.

Did not find out I was even pregnant until I was six MONTHS {since you can go without bleeding with Mirena, it was not out of the ordinary}. Even worst part about it is that I found out... on my HONEYMOON. Now if you can put yourself in my shoes, I thought it was as unbelievable as my OBGYN did, given rarity of the situation {only 2 in 1000}. And of course I thought of everything I did the past 6 months that you are not supposed to do during pregnancy. I was smoking, I was drinking, I was doing shots at the bar at my hubby's 21st birtday. WOW. Unbelieveable. I had no words. Completely speechless. And now I had to bear the fact that this thing is in me SOMEWHERE, and in very close proximity to my baby inside me. The odds of something happening to this baby now that the Mirena is somewhere near it, was pretty good. Scary to say the least. And even scarier considering I had my first child young, which is the only reason I got this dumb thing, to prevent pregnancy, at least for awhile! The only postitive thing to come out of this is I had a happy and surprisingly healthy baby girl, born only a week early, January 8, 2014. Had to have an ultrasound and TWO xrays to even find the damn thing inside me. Now I have to have lapriscopic surgery to surgically remove it since it traveled down, outside of my uterus. VERY SCARY.To say the least I am not looking forward to this surgery at all. I certainly am never getting this form of birth control ever again. I myself would NEVER recommend this to anyone, considering all of the pain and suffering i have endured through this rough patch in my life. Hopefully someone that may be in my shoes can take something from my story and learn from it. I guess the question I want to ask is, how in the world do you go about talking to the Mirena corporation, to complain about this and make a claim? I see all those commercials on Tv but they look too generic for me to believe that they're real. Someone help me!! "

Up to the time it started, I could grip with my right hand and use it carefully (in the sling) for a number of things, including cutting cheese.

When I wake-up in the morning, I experience both extreme urinary bladder pain and [what seem to be] kidney pain on both sides of my back. The pain is intensified if I do not drink a fair amount of water/fluids before I go to sleep. I am allergic to Chlorine--when I accidentally drink chlorinated water, I also experience extreme urinary bladder when I wake-up in the morning. The bladder pain goes away after drink several glasses of water and several hrs. The ""kidney "" pain reduces with time and wearing either an elastic or a neoprene Back Support Belt.

Surgery,https://www.drugs.com/answers/succinylcholine-good-info-succinylcholine-read-738933.html,Succinylcholine - GOOD INFO about SUCCINYLCHOLINE Read this story?,"I had a horrible experience coming out of my first surgery in 2000 (tonsillectomy) in CA. My arms were flailing and I felt like I was seizuring, i couldn't breathe, panicky and couldn't talk in order to tell people what I was experiencing. The nurses rushed me to the recovery room, put the thumb/oxygen reader thing on me and determined I would be fine and that I was receiving enough oxygen. They patted my hand and said "" Don't worry honey, you're fine."" and walked away. They were very neglectful and ignorant towards what was happening and practically ignored me. The other people in the recovery room seemed more concerned about my wellbeing!  I was partially paralyzed and I was unable to speak and in a panic thinking that i would die because i was struggling so hard to breathe. My arms were flailing uncontrollably around and I couldn't believe no one would come over and try to talk to me! The nurses checked on me 2 or three times over the next 8 hours or so until they decided I was ready to be released. I was the last one in the recovery room that evening, and I still was unable to speak and barely able to breathe. My boyfriend & his mom arrived to pick me up around 8 pm or so.   He thought I was in extreme pain because I was so pale, still shaking and couldn't talk, but the tonsillectomy wasn't painful. I wrote down on a piece of paper ""can't breathe"" and he and his mom totally freaked out. The nurse didn't say anything to it, and they just wanted to get me out of there.   Regardless of the PTSD I now suffer from because of my bad experience,I did recover, but had no idea what had gone wrong. The anesthesiologist wrote that there were no problems with the surgery or the anesthesia. ( A ""2 out of 10"" as far as problems was recorded on the surgery report).   About 8 years later, my sister underwent back surgery in Colorado at an excellent hospital. As she came out of it, she began having some similar reactions in not being able to breathe. Immediately the anesthesiologist recognized what was happening and put her back under (so she would not remember the traumatic event) and put a special agent in her to assist in metabolizing the succynolcholine agent faster. Once she was alert, he explained exactly what had happened and what he thinks it is.   It is called Pseudocholinesterase Deficiency and it is found in approximately 1 of 500 people. It is an allergy to Succynolcholine (that paralyzing agent that they give you in surgery to paralyze your muscles and some organs-- as you have read here already in other chats.)   My sister got a simple blood test and it proved that she did indeed have the ""allergy"" for lack of a better term. I was tested too of course and I have it. It is genetic.  There are different degrees of the allergic reaction, so each person may metabolize the agent more quickly than others. Normally, it should only take a few minutes at the most, probably less. If you are allergic, or suspect you might be, get the simple blood test to find out. (Ask your doctor, or call the hospital/anesthesiologist dept to find out the name of the test.) If you have it, you should be wearing a medical bracelet. If you were to be in an accident, paramedics might need to put an oxygen tube down your windpipe, and they may use succinylcholine as a quick way to get that tube in. If something goes wrong, some paramedics who are unfamiliar with this might think something more serious, such as a brain injury is going on. It might cause more problems in an emergency situation.  Nowadays and fortunately, however, succynocholine is not always the paralyzing agent of choice in emergencies, or even surgeries I believe. But a medical bracelet should still be worn. From what I understand, this condition is being taught in the medical field and is more easily recognizable now by medics and medical personnel. Obviously, this was not the case during my surgery in 2000. Good luck. "

This is three wks after surgery and i was telling him Im still having alot of pain and discomfort. it wasnt like I was asking for moriphine or percacet but to continue what i was taking that was atleast making pain tolorable. 5/325 has been completely unhelpful.

I specialize in heart surgery as a?","... first assistant. I have been doing hearts for the last 22 years. I have never missed a call, day or night in all of those years. I had a series of major life events the last 2 years of my practice. My mother died, a few months later the Doctor I started this heart group with suddenly died at 45. I had a 6 day malpractice trial (we won) but it took a great part of me away. We hired 2 new heart surgeons just before the previous doctor died. They helped each other, and I had helped the doctor that died.. After he died I had to help the other 2 doctors. We operated all over town, at all the major hospitals. My work load was tremendous. I would close a patient at one hospital then rush across town and start another. I had started using Hydrocodne daily 5 years before all of this happened. Not much at first, Of course I started doing more and more. It made me feel great and I could work all those long hours. It had a reverse effect on me, I was more focused and re leaved much of my stress. I used the internet to obtain my pills. One night after a case I just threw a big fit, told them all to kiss my ass, and abruptly quit the group. That was the beginning of my journey of the psychiatric world. I started using cocaine, Valium, alcohol, along with the Hydrocodone. I made a very good attempt at suicide. In a coma for 5 days on a ventilator, transferred to a mental hospital,31 days, and came out with a diagnosis of Bi-Polar 2. and a whole collection of medication. I lost my State License, haven't worked in over 3 years. I have been taking all of these medications with out question. You would think me being in the medical field for 30+ years I would know better. I am just a former shell of the person I used to be. Due to all these SSRI's and a number of other drugs I have lost interest in every thing, sex, live music I have lost all contact with all of my friends and almost never leave the house. Finally my question. I don't know how I could be a true Bi-Polar person and First assist heart surgery for the last 22 years. on call 24-7. I was on staff at all the major hospitals in good standing. My Mother suffered from depression in the 50's, well most of her life. I have always been a type ""A"" personality, very active, artistic, and out going. What the Hell happened to me. I truly do not know if I am Bi-Polar or not. At present I am trying to ween off all of these horrible drugs, and start on Wellbutrin, I hope this will being ME back. They have me on some(off Label) drugs as well. Little did I know getting off of these drugs may have some life threatening and severe side effects some may be long lasting and even permanent. If I had not found this great group of caring people I don't know where I would be. I have only been here a few days and I have all ready received so much hope and strength. Thank you all. I am going to get better. "

After the surgery left the hospital on Diluid givin to me by painmanagement, well that makes me throw up so when I saw my surgeon 2 days later, I asked if I could go back on Oxycotin/ perceot like I was on before. He told me that was fine and gave me a prescription for perceot because I was out of those for the break threw pain. I also was due for refill of oxycotin and refilled the prescription.

Before she got back to me, I forgot I saw pain management while in the hospital and they were the ones who put me on diluid, so I went back to them.

Now He doesn't drink or do drugs, but he is on alot of medication, He has had 16 surgerys on his body, It's a joke in our family we call him the Bionic man. So Even years ago I would remember him being a little out of it, like he was working on a car allday, and like I said he's Ridiculously Hurt, so he would just pop another pill when he felt real bad, but as the car was being finished and he was done, he would get hit with all themeds at once, since while he was working the pain meds were doing their job, but when he stopped 5-10 minutes later, he would be out of it. I have seen him like that a few times when he has a job to do fixing the car, but in the last few years he has become a lunatic.Well he is 100 % certified crazy.He has PTSD,Bi-POlar, and is a Manic Depressive, so he is a sweet and good guy, but not when hes having his lows.But to get to the point. About 10 years ago he was diagnoseed with type 2 Diabetes, which he has kept under control perfect, he DR even took him off the Meds a few Times. But in these last 2 or 3 years, he has been blacking out, and getting loopy, talking about things that happened 40 years ago, and he will describe in such detail, or he will just get really angry and look for a fight, now he is not like this at all. He use to be exactly like that wwhen I was a kid, but since operation after Operation, he slowed down. So I would talk to him while he was like this,and try to see whats on his mind, and found out some crazythings I won't print. But I would blame these4 fits on his xanaxs, since he hardly takes them, i thought that it was the medicine, becuase he wont take it for weeks, ut when he's in a state I seen him take a handful, so naturally I'm worried, but he would always be allright, and his favorite thing was Burning everyones stuff, His own, My old memorobilia and pictures, EVERYTHING, these fits would last days, then boom he would just snap out of it, usuallyafter a little sleep.So I got to thinking, I always blamed these fits on his psyco personality mixed with anax, but sure enough, out Its HIS SUGAR LEVEL. When he gets too low he is not himself,he doesnt even remember what he has done, He would loose Hundreds of Dollars, his wallet, and even car keys. 1 time he went to go pay two months rent owed, so I go with him of course, he insisted me waiting in the car, I waited about 35 minutes there I found him in a pizzeria, with no money, no wallet and no keys.He never made it inside the Building to pay rent, Luckily by the grace of God, I found all of it. And told him get in the back seat lay down and i'll be right back, i paid rent and drove home, He got some good long sleep, and said hey you ready I gotta go pay rent, he didn't remember anything. The damn SUGAR is driving him Crazy. I'm sorry for going on about this, BUT JUST NEED 2 Know if this has happened to anyone, or anything similar at all. Thanks Guys NewYorkGuy44. "

Here is his situation... ; he has been taking the pink 3600 v pills (10/500mg hydrocodones) for a few years now, and has steadily built a tollerance to them, and is now having to take up to 9 at a time just to take the edge off the pain... Well he has heard that taking them rectally is more effective, although he thinks he will be able to put all 9 in and be safe, my question is, knowing that isnt safe for ANYONE,even with that much tollerance, how many would he be able to take rectally to equil the 9 (90mg hydrocodone) so as to not have to orally take so many and risk killing himself or having his liver shut down on him? Would 2 rectally be just as effective as 9 orally or would he still be coming up short because of his tollerance? Thank you to anyone who is willing to help out, and I hope this is taken serioudly, I know the answer would most likelybe, zero is yhe safest amount, but this guy is so tired of having to take the pills all together that any amount less than what he has to take now would be helpfull because he is actually thinking about giving in and just doing it without waiting for and answer.

(Also have mixed states bipolar, narcolepsy w/o cataplexy, and REM sleep behavior disorder -- the second of which may also be involved, especially re: the excessive sleeping ... plus the pain that comes after the stress-hit of the impending trip has lifted.) Have spent last two+ days asleep because of, at minimum, pain meds for severity of pain in back where kidneys are located and almost unbearable pain in both legs from stress or some other disorder/reaction. (Take morning doses of 450 mg Wellbutrin for depression, 250 mg Nuvigil along with 5 mg Ritalin to keep me awake from the narcolepsy, and often 5 mg Valium for anxiety [along with first 1000 mg Gabapentin]; early afternoon doses of 10 mg Ritalin [along with another 1000 mg Gabapentin]; and bedtime doses of 500 - 1000 mg Depakote for manic episodes, 1 mg Xanax to put me to sleep in reaction to narcolepsy and to keep its nightmares away, and 2 mg Klonopin to keep me asleep and paralyzed from the REM sleep behavior disorder [along with the last daily dose of 1000 mg Gabapentin -- all 3 doses of which will be increased until I'm on a 3600 mg minimum of it). Oh, and up to 40 mg Oxycodone daily, as needed -- but I had to raise it a little to get by. Is 3000 mg of Gabapentin responsible for such pain? Should I call my doctor or wait it out and keep raising the dosage, as instructed? I know I should cancel my attendance at the wedding because I'm not up to it, but... Any advice, comments, or info would be welcomed. Thank you. "

Since then I've learned that insomnia isn't about weak-will (unemployed with a bad job market, I tried for about 3 years to overcome the insomnia problem). When I finally got a job, I used alcohol to sleep because I wasn't on insurance and I could at least function with the sleep alcohol provided. Things got better.

The problem is this—my doctor's office has recently had a shake-up. My doctor left and it seems like the office no longer believes that I need ambien—they think I'm an addict. I've been through this before. They insist that insomnia is a real medical problem and yet they're no longer willing to prescribe ambien. They want to keep me as a patient but want the sleep specialist that I'm going to see to take-over the prescription. This drug has drastically improved the quality of my life.

Smoking,https://www.drugs.com/answers/sleep-apnea-pauses-breath-sleep-anxiety-related-2367980.html,"Can sleep apnea come and go, or is my pauses of breath during sleep anxiety related?","Just a little background. I am a male 36 years old living in Quebec, Canada. I am on 150 mg of Invega Sustenna injections for schizoaffective disorder. I quit smoking for almost a year but stupid me I started to smoke again the second week of November 2014 because of stress. I also gained weight, I was previously around 162 - 165 in the summer, now I am about 178 (height 5'8). The third week of November 2014 for about 3 days I would continuously pause breathing during sleep. It went away, but this breathing pattern started up again on December 9th up until this day (December 16th). Some nights I would sleep very well, but other nights I would be half asleep for the whole night. In the morning I would be extremely exhausted. I also noticed on the nights I sleep very well (Go to bed at 11pm and wake up at 5-6am) when waking up that early and trying to squeeze in another 1 hour of sleep, the pausing would happen continuously. I would be about to sleep in the middle of a thought and then the breathing would pause. I am wondering if this breathing problem has to do with when I am awake or being conscious just before falling asleep. I also notice I do the same pattern of pausing breaths during the day. I would be breathing and then all of a sudden it stops, having to regain the breathing process again. This happens all the time, stopping breath after a few minutes of breathing. I am stressed and worried because of money problems also been looking for a job for a while. I am relatively inactive because I have what I believe to be, arthritis in my right knee (I am being followed for this). I know what sleep apnea is, but I am questioning whether I have sleep apnea, or the pauses of breath during the day and during sleep are anxiety related. I wonder this because why would I sleep well on some nights for most of the night, and other nights remain half asleep still conscious. At night I would be conscious of the pauses, it seems to happen when I am focused on a thought. I would think of something and then realize I am not breathing while in the thought. This would happen during the day also but I would be fully awake to regain the breathing process. I am hoping its not Central Sleep Apnea, although it feels like it is, because I am conscious of the pauses when trying to fall asleep. Also right after I notice I am not breathing I would get knots or butterflies in my stomach accompanied with a feeling of intense worry and sometimes a head rush, and also sometimes my head and body would tingle or go numb. This doesn't happen all the time. I don't know if this is related, but before all this happened, for the months of August, September and October, while trying to fall asleep my body would suddenly and abruptly jerk just as I am about to fall asleep. I believe it is a called Hypnic Jerk. Maybe this phenomenon evolved into what is now my breathing problem. It seem now that instead of my body jerking, it has been replaced by pauses of breath. I would still get the jerking but not as much as before. I have been on the Sustenna since February 2014 after being hospitalized for 2 months in a psychiatric institution. I went to see my GP and he referred me to a sleep clinic which I am awaiting a callback to let me know when it is. He said it could take up to 6 months. If it is Sleep Apnea I might need a CPAP.  Last night I tried sleeping without a pillow and for most of the night I slept. I woke up at 6:30am and tried to get another hour of sleep and the pausing started to happen continuously. Also I am not sure if I am breathing regularly during the nights I sleep well or the pauses are happening and I am just sleeping through it. I guess I have to wait for the sleep study to tell me. I want to know, because some nights I sleep well (for most of the night) and other nights I don't. Could it be just anxiety related rather than the problem being sleep apnea. Isn't sleep apnea suppose to be a constant thing, or does it come and go? I also want to know if this is being caused by the 150mg of Sustenna I take once a month. Maybe it is relaxing my breathing to the point of not even breathing. Please help. "

Following the surgery she was in constant pain so they continued to give her Oxicodine and then perscribed her Ambien so that she could sleep at night. A couple weeks later they took her off of the Oxicodine and gave her Vicodin pills instead while still on Ambien. After a month or so of taking Vicodin she had to stop taking it because she began to have a burning sensation everytime she swollowed it traveling from her throat to her stomage, or I guess I should say her intestines. Now she's on the Fental patch and a generic version of Ambein, but now her stomage pains are increasing. I know that she had a total gastrectomy not too long ago and that its still healing, but I know something is up. She also has mood swings, paranoia, anxiety, soreness and is sometimes, more than not, depressed. But the worst thing is that her taste buds have, in a sense, gone to saltly hell. Ever since she's been on the Fental patch, her saliva constantly tastes like a pool of salt, and candy and sweets help, but a side effect of a gastrectomy is that her body isn't able tolterate sweets or sugar in general, which often leads to her dumping syndromes. Ambien helps her sleep but I've been reading that her mood swings could be a side effect from it, the Fental patch helps her a great deal with her pains, but now its seems to be giving her pain, along with cold sweats, nausea, and tiredness.

Please help with suggestions?,"Ever since I had my cervical fusion & lumbar fusion surgery I have had the WORST skin problems. I would describe them as deep boils to infected hair follicles. These boils or infected pours become very deep and painful. Sometimes they itch. I started to have these bumps/cysts on/in my ear and it has taken over my entire ear lobe. It is amazing how much blood can come from just an ear lobe! This does not seem to be contagious as my boyfriend has not been affected by this. These boils/bumps, infected hair follicles have only appeared on my face, neck, arms, back and chest. Sometimes I can get them to clear up, but then just as soon as one heals, another one comes up.  I have no insurance so this does not help the matter. I went to an Urgent care and was treated with an antibiotic, both topical and oral, to treat ""Impetigo"" or staff infections. This helped some, but as soon as I ran out, the shenanigans just came back, and I could not get a refill on the script without coming back into the urgent care and paying another $80.00 for another evaluation. The medication itself was $50.00! Another issue with the skin is among these nasty boils, skin infections, is random spots or redness like a heat rash, but that comes and goes.  The trunk of my body and legs are not effected by this skin infection except for one or 2 ingrown hairs on my leg that is trying to heal. Again, once the ingrown hair thing happens, the infection just seems to dig deeper into my skin and it hurts/itches something awful. The ones on my face, from the ""baby hairs"" are the worst and leave awful scars :( The ones on my arms take forever to heal and itch the most. I wear long sleeves to try to minimize my scratching and breaking open the sore. Ive cut my finger nails down to nothing but you'd be surprised what you can still pick with with your stub fingers. I get really bad blisters up by my eyebrows too from the ingrown hairs. It's brutal :( Ive tried Neutrogena soaps and toners and their OTC acne medications, Neosporin, A & D ointment, gold bond anti itch cream... ugh, NOTHING seems to help:( This is not helping my depression from the back pain and back & neck surgery recovery. I want my face back too and be able to wear tank tops without all of these disgusting sores all over them :( I know that sounds vein, but seriously, this has got to stop! Can someone please try to give me a direct route I need to go to minimize expenses... and if this can be something treated OTC even better! "

I am taking for smoking cessation, not for depression so I'm just asking how long it usually takes before it becomes 100% because during these 4 days I've been taking it, I definitely have noticed that my cravings have went down a lot which makes me very happy because I was a pack a day+ smoker and I liked smoking but a job offer at a hospital came and I didn't realize that your not aloud to smoke at all(even in your own home) so PERIOD... if you work for them at the hospital. They draw your blood after your interview if you are then hired, you sign a smoking cessation contract saying that there is no tobacco or nicotine in your system n they will do random tests later and if nicotine is found it's immediate termination. So i had to go from a pack a day of Newport 100s to NOTHING! Which is crazy! It being a hospital you would think they would allow you to quit within a certain time period and with help, like nicotine patches, lozenges, him etc... Or gaping starting with 24mgs(same as cigs) but then every couple days, go down to 20mgs, 18mgs, then 16, 12, 10, 6, and lastly 3mgs n then you can continue to vape but you would have weaned yourself over about a month to 6wks time down to 0mgs of nicotine so you can still ""smoke"" if you want to out of habit but you won't be smoking any chemicals or tobacco... just vapor in whatever your favorite flavors are.(mine happen to be piña colada, vanilla custard, butterscotch and blue slushy!) I quit smoking on my own for a year n a half b4 that way although I stayed always with a small amount of nicotine in my juice(about 6mgs) but it was way healthier than smoking because there was no tobacco, no 24mgs of nicotine, and most of all none of the thousands of other chemicals that are in cigarette. Anyways for this job you have to just stop immediately! So that's why I'm on my 4th day this morning on the Wellbutrin and I've been vaping also(my lifeline! Lbvs!) which is amazing for my worst craving times which is when I wake up in morning w my coffee and then anytime after I eat! Only diff is that my vape juice has 0 nicotine obviously but that makes it extremely hard on me! And thank goodness for the Wellbutrin making my cravings go from 20 a day to only thinking about needing one maybe bout 4-5times! So i will say that so far the medication IS working! Along with my vape pen so that I can at least puff on that during those real bad parts of everyday that I badly need a cigarette, I can at least halfway feel like I'm smoking. But anyways that's just how I'm doing so far... was wondering, for the people that have been on it at least a few months... if it gets better n better the longer your on it? Or if there is a certain timing like for example ""after 2 weeks it's in your body the strongest"" sort of thing? They have to build up in your body for a week or a month or whatever. OR... do they start off at there strongest right when u first start taking them... more like a narcotic pain pill (Vicodin etc... ) I just wanna no if this is as good as it gets? Which is very good and helping a lot but I still HAVE TO have my VAPE! Or does it keep getting better for a week or so until it hits it's peak in your body?

Wondering for the sake of my daughters. My second question is about medication for UTI's. I get them often, and as I'm sure many of you know, they are quite easy to self diagnose. So, my Dr gave me a prescription for Macrobid to keep on hand to take 1 after intercourse or to take 2 for 5 days if I don't catch it in time and get a full blown UTI. I ran out of that prescription and had to switch Dr's. The new Dr also gave me a prescription to take the same way but instead of Macrobid she gave me Bactrim ds. I took it about 4 times with no issues but the 5th time I started itching like crazy and my eyelids swelled up. My friend that is a nurse told me to take Benadryl. I took the Benadryl and soon after the swelling and intense itching subsided. I can only assume I had an allergic reaction to the Bactrim. Can you develop an allergic reaction to a medication you have taken before with no problems? It helped with the oncoming feelings and signs of a UTI but because of the effect I had, I definitely don't want to take the Bactrim again so I called my Dr to see about getting a prescription for Macrobid again. I am now with a different Dr (again) due to the last one leaving the practice. This new Dr said she didn't like to give out antibiotics just to ""have on hand"" and would like me to come in and be seen whenever I have a UTI. I'm a little frustrated with this as I get UTI's so often and it really helps to just take 1 after intercourse. Plus, because they are SO painful I'd rather not wait until I got one and had to be seen. Especially since it is very difficult to get into my Dr for a same day appt. Lastly, the cost of going in every time would be ridiculous. Does anyone have any suggestions for my situation? Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks! "

I have been getting UTIs for the last 10 years, up until a few months a go, i'd have 1 maybe 2 a year, which I could cope with, but since April this year I have had three which I have needed antibiotics for, and in between these (what I call fully blown infections - constantantly needing to wee, blood in my urine, very painful to urinate), I have also felt 'not right' where I have been taking over the counter remedies and drinking cranberry unti it comes out of my ears to ease the symptoms and try to ward them off. Although it is only a few months that this has been happening so often I am worn out by it, and feel very anxious and upset. It just seems to be one after another at the moment. I'm constanctly calling in sick, or crying in the toilets because I can't think of anything but needing the loo, and the pain it causes! It's got to the point where it is at the forefront of my mind, I dread having sex incase I get another UTI (i'm not even sure if that is the 'cause'), and I feel sick at the thought of going on holiday next week just incase I get one, and can't get any medication for it! Anyway, to come back to my original question, all three of my infections over the last couple of months have been successfully treated with Trimethoprim, and in the accompanying leaflet it says that it can also be taken in lower doses once a day for prevention.  I have an appointment with my doctor booked for Friday and I am going to ask about this, but I don't know how common it is to do this. At this point I feel like i'm going to burst into tears if she says no!
